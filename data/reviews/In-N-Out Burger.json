{"text":"Drive thru: I guess it's opposite day at the drive thru.  Apparently a 'no, thank you' to 'do you want some ketchup' means 17 (I counted) ackets of ketchup for 1 order of fries. Less a star because I'm not a fan of people being wasteful. I know it's just a little thing, but it irks me."}
{"text":"I eat here a regularly, but realized I've never given them a review! The menu is simple, and if you want a \"fast food\" burger this is the only place to go.  I typically order the double-double w/o the (thousand islands sauce) and onion (this saves not only by breathe, but about 200 calories), and have them add ketchup and mustard. I do have to say the fries are just ok (5 Guys' are much better, but then they are 1400 calories for the large, so I'll eat these ones and be happy my waist is not expanding).  Always lined up during the busy hours, but the line does move fairly quickly.  Just a great burger!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start when it comes to this place...let's just say the day I move out of AZ that's the ONLY thing I will miss about it is In n Out. I can't say the weather or the red mountains or lakes, nope...BUT I WILL for sure miss the burgers/fries of In n' Out. In a couple of weeks I will be there to splurge on another double double (I don't have it often). I try my best to resist, but the smell alone makes me crawl back to this comfort food and keeps me in the zone. See what I mean...I just had a moment."}
{"text":"I was in the area running errands with my mom. We were both hungry and it was around 6 and I asked her if we could stop here. My mom and I are on a more healthy diet and coming here kind of threw us off but you know it would have been longer going home and preparing something ourselves.   I don't always have my mom pay for my food but without her saying anything I had a feeling she wanted to do it because I had bought breakfast, lunch and dinner for her several times within the last few weeks (all spaced out of course). It was a great night because I got to spend some quality time with just my mom. I truly enjoy it but the burgers are INSANE good and the fries well I think they are healthier than McDonalds or Burger King."}
{"text":"Phoenix is LUCKY to have In-N-Out(s). Moving out of the LA area meant that we didn't have an In-N-Out nearby. Problem solved!  Most importantly - The food is consistently fantastic. Don't go to some other guy's place for a burger. Go here.   Important backup information: - CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN. Oh yes, the tables are constantly cleaned by their staff. Did I mention the bathrooms are spotless also?! - Helpful Staff - Great hiring practices at In-N-Out because the staff is friendly, quick, efficient, and well trained. - Secret Menu - I mentioned the great food, but checkout the secret menu at their website: http://www.in-n-out.com/secretmenu.asp  Fun and quick place for a fantastic burger."}
{"text":"We had to try this place after hearing all the HYPE about it. What a let down! The burger was so thin you could barely taste it and the fries were so bland and stale tasting. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Good quick burgers not sure about all the hype but just like every regional thing. Will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Why are these so popular again???  Just went to one for the second time in my life, and was reminded why it is not a \"must go\" for me.  Just an extremely average burger and fries, only the burger is smaller, and the prices are the same.....was over $7 for me to eat a maybe 3\" diam Burger meal."}
{"text":"I have gone through the drive through several times and I have always been greeted with the friendliest staff I have ever experienced at a fast food restaurant.  Combine that with the amazing food, this restaurant is now my favorite burger place."}
{"text":"Always hot, fresh, and delicious. This is the burger place to beat... No one even comes close!  The milkshakes are worth the extra time I must spend at the gym working them off.  The burgers are always incredible, and I love  that you an order off-menu.  So glad they are a stone's throw away..."}
{"text":"In & Out Burger is my FAVORITE.  I could have one of their burgers any day, at any time.  Hands down, my favorite.   DYING for them to expand and come east!!  Reviewing this location in Phoenix as it was the last one I visited.  I was with over a dozen rowdy softball players, and they put together our entire order in no time.  Their locations are always clean, with classic decor and super friendly staff.  I've heard that they pay their employees very well, so they're in turn loyal, and treat the customers (and prepare the food) very well.  The menu is simple, and everything on it is fantastic.  You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"The best burger joint I have ever had! Travel a lot, been to many burger places that claim they have the \"greatest!\" In and out burger can claim this, hands down!  The sauce on the burger, is unique and tasty, making this place original!  Smart thinking, placing an order taking outside, making the wait time less!"}
{"text":"In & Out is a hamburger at it's best.  I have tried more expensive places, but for taste and value you cannot beat a Double-Double.  Tastes better than anythign from Habbit.  Fresh taste and great fries.  Off menu items are great, and worth the search on the web.  Go Animal style on your burger, and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here relatively late and it was packed - always a good sign at any restaurant. Their menu is relatively simple with prices similar to other chains such as McDonalds but with MUCH better quality in food.   I ordered the Double Double - Animal Style. This is a burger with two meat patties which, usually, I would think is too much meat for a burger. After my first bite, HOLY. MOTHA. COW. Juicy burger with crisp veggies and a soft toasted bun rounded out with creamy thousand island dressing. Nom NOM! Definitely a 5 star burger.  My friend got fries which I thought were pretty meh. Next time I come I'll definitely try the Animal Fries which I've heard so much about."}
{"text":"There is not a cleaner and healthier burger place on this planet,  this guys are so busy that they are constantly rushing and when you talk to them it's like being in a fine dining restaurant, how do they do it, wow, anyway very polite and they do everything to make this an memorable experience. I love in and out burgers, that is the only place I could eat a burger and say wow."}
{"text":"Hambúrguer extremamente delicioso, grande e por um preço MUITO barato. O cardápio é propositalmente simples, com poucas opções, mas isso também é um ponto positivo! Os funcionários são muito simpáticos e o ambiente é bonito, tipo lanchonete americana antiga. Amei tudo a respeito desse lugar! Vale a visita!"}
{"text":"I can say that is one of my favourite burger. It's simple maded but delicous. Grilled Cheese menns two slices of melted American cheese, spread with onions on a freshly baked bun is one of the secret menu. Marvelous! You also can order a double cheeseburger..."}
{"text":"Obviously this place is so yummy! I wanted to give some recognition to one of the employees, Pablo. We were there on 9/12/15 and he went above and beyond to help us out. He got us extra sauce, picked up our food for us, and overall helped us have a great experience!"}
{"text":"I come in at around 3:15, and I order a Number 2. I know how hard it can be to do drive through, but the guy there was so sweet (his name was Blake). I got up to the window and realized I forgot my wallet.... he opens up the window and i told him I was so sorry and I'd drive through. He said hold on and WENT AND GOT HIS OWN WALLET. He paid for my meal, even when he had no idea who I was. I just wanted everyone to know how kind Blake and the whole staff was  you're doing an amazing job"}
{"text":"Place is legit, always friendly, always fresh and always busy.   Cheap too, as far as fast food burgers go what else can you ask for????"}
{"text":"its a frigging fast food restaurant people, rating it higher than 1 means youre part of the overweight masses killing this country"}
{"text":"Classic chain food place. So I will review on the service because the food is just like most others. I am greeted with a smile and like the people there. but it should be a little cleaner I think."}
{"text":"In Galway,Ireland here,heading to Tempe next week for booze and fun....looking at eats around Tempe....In n out burger is getting a visit defo"}
{"text":"This iconic West Coast burger shop is very overrated. The staff was efficient, polite, and friendly. I had the double double burger, which was quite bland. The french fries are perhaps the worst in the fast food universe. The chocolate shake was good. Overall, the prices are pretty good and considering their reputation, they could certainly charge more. I'm underwhelmed and unless I want to admire a well trained crew , I'll probably pass on In n Out in the future."}
{"text":"I Love In N out! Every time I go to Vegas, In N out right a way. I wished they would build one in Albuquerque, I would go there non stop because its so gooooooooood. The fries and burgers are soooo amazing! If you're ever near one GO AND BUY A BURGER ASAP"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The experience is always enjoyable, employees always friendly, and the food is always great!!!"}
{"text":"Full belly! Got the #1 Grillled Onion's, No Tomato, and well done! Cooked the way I ordered it and served hot with fries that are tasty strings of potatoes!"}
{"text":"last honost burger chain america! besides dicks in seattle, double double is legit, fries are ok but at least they are fresh, this place gets packed so be prepared for a short wait."}
{"text":"Maybe my most favorite place to eat in the world!!!  And also people watch late on a weekend night. It's krazy!"}
{"text":"I normally dont write reviews about fast food in general, however I must say I was impressed by the service.   So on 10-25-12 at about 10:30am I stoped by for a quick bite to eat; and when I walk inside the lines were from the register to the door. Needless to say I made an about face and went to the drive through. Considering the lines inside I thought I would be waiting quite a bit in the drive through lane. That however was not the case. I did have to wait but it was noting like you would expect from approx 7-9 cars lined up. My order was not mixed-up, everything was the way I ordered it, and the food was still hot when I receieved it.   Forget the other In-and-Out's; this one is the best."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick burger and fries. Love the service just as well. If all places had employees like this even places with average food would have a good business. I have to recognize one employee tonight and her name is Adrianna great smile and better service than I deserve. One big shout out to all th employees of InNOut, I have never seen employees that work so hard to make a great guest experience. Hope Adrianna gets enough money saved for her first car as she deserves it!  Thanks again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure there's a solution to it, but the cones they have up to direct the line make it extremely tough to get in line when coming from the road. Two cars got caught up in the line when trying to just go past it in the short time I was there.  The food is just perfection, of course. In-N-Out is always delicious!"}
{"text":"I recently moved from Texas and had so many jealous friends that raved about In and Out and insisted I try. Must say I LOVE their fries! The burgers were very good and I plan to try whatever \"animal style\" is very soon!"}
{"text":"I love there burgers,shakes,and fries. There so good but it is actually not filling but that's OK but I still love In and out burger."}
{"text":"Great as always , got a strawberry shake as well that hit the spot. Always consistent with the flavors , however my bun was a bit darker than normal , execution slightly off there. All in all , all around great bang for the mighty dollar."}
{"text":"I never write reviews and never felt compelled to after tonight. As someone that's in management of a Fortune 500 company, cuddos to the manager on staff at 7:00pm tonight. Orders pushed out quickly, restraunt very clean, and they made customers feel welcomed. This location has always given me the best service out all in-n-out burgers I've visited."}
{"text":"Every single time I've came in to this particular in and out the service and food has always been excellent."}
{"text":"If you're in a hurry and on a budget, this is the place to go for a burger.  Best fast food burger for the price (around $7 for the double combo), plus the fries are hand-cut and always fresh.  The options are limited but there are several hidden menu choices if you ask such as fried onions, lettuce instead of bun, etc."}
{"text":"I had heard from others this place was not as good as the hype but to go for the experience.  We don't have In-N-Out Burger here on the east coast, so when in Las Vegas, we figured we had to go.  There is no good way to get there if you are on the strip.  Even though it is down the street from the strip, you pretty much have to take a cab.  Sadly the cab ride is more expensive then the food itself.  But I guess that is part of the experience.  When we got there the line was literally out the door.  This scared us, but the line did move pretty fast.  My husband ordered the double double animal style, I ordered the cheeseburger meal with fries and a drink.  I did not get animal style as I wasn't sure if I would like the sauce or not.  I should have gotten cheese fries, but I didn't.  While my husband was waiting to get our order, I searched and searched for a seat.  Finally I was able to grab a seat in the corner.    When my husband brought our food to the table, it looked good.  I am glad I got the cheeseburger and not the double double, as it was just enough for me.  The bun was fresh and soft and slightly warm, the burger was extremely juicy, and the special sauce complimented the burger nicely.  The burger also had a good amount of lettuce and tomatoes on it.  The abundance of fries was just right.  My husband's double double animal style was double meat, double cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions and pickles.   He too was very pleased with this meal.  In-N-Out is known for all fresh ingredients, never frozen.  I have to say I enjoyed it and thought it was much better than a five guys.  Since everyone is pretty much taking a cab to get to In-N-Out, it is pretty easy to get a cab back.  I wish they had In-N-Out burger here on the east coast!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this local favorite.  Great food, excellent service.  Their fries are the best!"}
{"text":"what else is there to say about this place that hasnt been said already? I came to vegas for 5 days and ate here twice.  ive heard about in-n-out for a while and we dont have it on the east coast.  if you are tired of the dining on the strip (and the prices), in-n-out is the way to go.  this is probably one of the best values u will get if you are staying on the strip.    traveling by bus from the strip will cost you $1.75 each way.  the wait for the bus was never more than 10 minutes.  keep in mind, that the bus fees are different from the bus fees on the \"deuce\" bus, which is $3 each way.    im still craving in-n-out burger.  its so simple but so good."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great prices. I eat here at least once a week. Employees always have a smile on their faces!"}
{"text":"Figured I'd give this place another shot with so much rave reviews. This establishment failed again. My double burger was salty and pretty greasy...and my fries at first taste tasted like it was sitting in oil for a while. It tasted like French fried chips and the texture was like a chip. Way over cooked...and crunchy as hell!! Will never be here again. Just go to 5 guys...it's always consistent there."}
{"text":"27th Ave and Peoria.... This area really needed the In N Out boost! This one is right around the corner from my house. On multiple times I've order my usual:  Double double animal style, extra lettuce, extra tomatoes, extra spread, chopped chilis, buns extra toasty, extra spread on the side Fries EXTRA well done  Not once, not even on their most busiest of days, have they tripped up my order. I'm no fool. I would *NEVER* take such an order to go. The spongy bun is meant to be eaten immediately, while the burger is hot and the condiments cold.   Always reliably fresh. Always reliably friendly service. Always reliably clean.   LOTS of love for In N Out, especially for bringing a bit of So Cal to my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Another quality burger experience. Went here to appease the visiting relatives but it wasn't bad!  Rock on; you do the things you do well, In and Out."}
{"text":"DEAR GOD WHY IS THERE NO MAYONNAISE Other than the lack of mayo, everything else here is delicious. Animal Style anything tastes delicious. Maybe they're doing me a favor by having no mayo, I'd be the person there gaining 5 pounds from a bunch of extra spread extra mayo animal style burgers."}
{"text":"I'm traumatized for life ! We just found a huge black spider crawling on our burgers !!!! Never coming back again ! And what's worse is that we just got off a 7 hour flight and this was our first stop ! We told the manager and he actually didn't believe us! At least we got a refund but I really think they need to get the kitchen cleanliness checked !"}
{"text":"Super fresh fries, awesome double double animal style, a tolerably longish wait in the drive thru for a favorite fast food treat we get once a year or less. Yum-o chocolate shake and an amazing vanilla strawberry shake to top things off. Excellent service at the window from an employee who was obviously having fun while she worked. She made us smile with her enjoyment, more than I can say for most window service!"}
{"text":"Um no, small patty to many tomato that made it appear bigger blah! Phone died so I couldn't take a pic."}
{"text":"Hit it at rush hour but the wait want that bad!  This was our first time to here and we were both impressed.  Definetly better than the place with the arches!  Now I'm going to have to keep an eye out for this chain as we travel."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to it after many Californian friends recommended.  It is not bad for a fast food place, definitely better than McD.  But i wouldn't want to waste a meal on it, since there are so many other great restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"Always the bomb for good food. Did I mention the fries are crazy delicious?!?!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan. Protein style or not, these burgers kick tail."}
{"text":"I've spent a rediculous amount of money on meals in vegas, but the double double animal at In-n-out is still probably the best thing I've eaten.  If I had to choose between a free meal at Craftsteak and In-N-Out, I'd probably have to flip a coin."}
{"text":"I went here today and IT WASNT FREEZING COLD inside like it usually is. It's a Christmas miracle!"}
{"text":"I live right around the corner and come here all the time and have always been satisfied. I have never been as disappointed with In-N-Out as I was last night. I went through the drive-thru (which always has a huge line) but my food has always been hot and fresh even after sitting in that line for 30 mins. I got my food, drove home (less than 2 mins) and i was about to eat my food when I felt the burger patties were ice cold! And my fries weren't even hot or crispy, they were a lukewarm disgusting soggy mess (and I get plain fries). I literally had to heat my burger up in the microwave before I could even eat it. Even then, it still didn't taste that great. I didn't even eat my fries because they were so soggy and mushy. Then to top it off,  my 7-up tasted like mold for some reason. I looked inside the cup and I didn't see anything, but maybe their ice machine needs to be cleaned out (I used to work in fast food). To say the least, I was extremely disappointed but I'm sure I'll be back because it's USUALLY really delicious and super close to my house. But I would recommend not going through the drive-thru especially on a Saturday night, and eating inside so you can make sure your food is hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Really. Your staff needs to learn how to read your ticket orders. We went drive thru waited for about 15 minutes which is not as bad as your usual drive thru line. We ordered 4 burgers and 2 fries. After pulling out we found out that they only gave us 1 order of fries. Went back inside the restaurant and staffs were trying to ignore what happen.  Did not even offer anything for the inconvenience. .. worst customer service ever!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the places I NEED to visit every time I'm in Las Vegas or anywhere in the mainland. Thankfully, there's one about a mile away from my brother's house. I can take a walk to work up an appetite and walk back without ever feeling guilty of eating too much food without exercising but since when did I feel guilty about that!?!  I always get a double cheeseburger animal style with their fries and a drink. The burger is juicy, tender and just the right size for me without being overly humongous. The fries is so addicting because it is cut and made fresh daily unlike the other fast food chains that is already loaded with salt.   Another thing I like about In-N-Out is their simplicity. They know that they are good at making burgers, fries and shakes and so that is what they focus on. They don't try to copy anyone else which is probably why they are so popular on the mainland.    I still have yet to try their shakes and animal style fries aka chili cheese fries so I can't wait til I go back to visit my brother back in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"I love In and out burger and especially their fries but today went there for lunch in the drive thru and the fries were horrible!  They tasted like they were from yesterday! Very disappointed! Not happy"}
{"text":"The first meal we had after landing in LV and getting our rental car.   We all know about the great burgers...  But this location has awesome service. The guy who took our order was friendly and funny. And while we were eating the cook and the guy who took our order came around to ask how everything was and if they could do anything else for us...even cleared our table for us.    It was a great first stop on our vacation!"}
{"text":"It's In n Out, so it's awesome and we all know this. Always a line at the drive-through, but the service is fast, and I don't think I've ever had anything wrong with my order. They don't have a specific kids menu, but they do offer stickers to kids, and as far as my kid is concerned, stickers are as good as any toy."}
{"text":"I have been going there for years.   They have the best menu.   They have a very polite and helpful crew.   They are always packed because they are so good!"}
{"text":"Their burgers are great!  I ordered double double animal style medium rare.  Outstanding!  Only reason they don't get a 5 star is because their fries suck!  2nd time I had them and even tried them as well done.  You can do anything to save these fries.  Word of advice, just don't get them.  This chain needs to do something to make their fries better, such as fresh cut like the 5 Guys chain does."}
{"text":"Yum! My husband and I love in and out. Awesome service and food. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Take it from a first timer from out of state - very good burgers, fries, and shakes. This location was packed at 1:30 PM, and is kept very clean. It's also a great stop on the way from your hotel on the strip when you're going or coming from Hoover dam.   I ordered a hamburger, fries, and a chocolate shake. I was not disappointed. :)"}
{"text":"Coming from the east coast, this is my first stop every time I visit the west coast. Burgers are super fresh. I love the animal sauce."}
{"text":"Came for an old fashion In-N-Out burger. The employees were joking around and not working promptly to get my order out. On top of all this there was no place to sit inside, not because it was busy, but because there was trash all over the tables. We decided to eat outside, no big deal. I come outside to bird shirt on my table."}
{"text":"We got a Double Double for each of us. It's just ok for us. The beef patty was so thin that I couldn't tell if it's good tasting or bad tasting. So I can only say it's okay. We like eating food with adequate amount of fat but this Double Double was way too greasy, we think the grease amount was beyond appropriate, which gave a negative effect on the burger overall. I think the grease was from the making of the food.   We definitely don't crave for In-N-Out burgers, we might come again only due to 1) convenience or 2) running out of options or 3) very very low budget."}
{"text":"I enjoy their burger every once in a blue moon.  I love the shakes, and the animal fries are super good!  I'd much rather order animals fries with a hamburger patty on the side."}
{"text":"This is not the one I was looking for. The one we ate at was the one in Apache junction arizona. However it doesnt matter since all of them are great. The burgers are made with fresh meat and the french fries are cut right there and fried in good oil. The price is unbeatable and the line moves really fast. We have eaten in at least 10 different in and outs and they are all fantastic and the price is right. Try them."}
{"text":"Great food like the others I've eaten inn the past, but like many have commented, the ENTER/EXIT to this place is crazy!"}
{"text":"This place is packed everytime I go, which just reflects the awesomeness of the food!  This is the only fast food burger place my family will go to.  Whenever we're thinkin' burgers...this is the place we go.  Even my 4 year old will eat a double meat all by himself!  WTF?  And the fries....taste sooo good!  The Best!!  A+"}
{"text":"This location is always busy, but that being said, they are very quick and have never messed up an order of mine. In and out definitely has the highest quality and best price for what you get in a fast food burger place. Every employee I've experienced has been very friendly. This is my favorite location in town!"}
{"text":"Arguably, the best burger place in the world.  The only other burger place that enters the argument is Five Guys.  When I stayed in Tempe, In and Out was my best friend.  Definitely, the best fries out there.  The custom orders take on a life of their own.  The service is uniquely friendly for a fast food place.  And, yeah, they stick to the main criteria of a fast food restaurant...FAST!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best food bargain outside of a down-market casino in Las Vegas!  They don't have In-N-Out Burger in Chicago, where I'm from, so I always try to stop here when I'm in Vegas.  The food is really fresh, including hand-cut french fries.  Avoid this place on the weekends and during lunch, however; it gets really crowded."}
{"text":"Let's face it, we live in a society where you can find a burger just about anywhere. However, I challenge you to find a better burger anywhere else, because I've tried and cannot do it!   They have the best burgers, plain and simple. The double-double is burger perfection. Toasted bun, slim and juicy burger patty, fresh lettuce, special sauce and add on some banana peppers like I do, and you have burger heaven. My dad and I used to stop at this place no less than 3 times on our California trips, so once they built them out here in AZ, it was a dream come true.   They are always fast, friendly, and fresh when you come to eat here, and the taste is outstanding. In fact, I think I'll go pick one up later, because writing about it makes me really want one..."}
{"text":"Always get a good meal at In-And-Out Burger whenever I'm traveling out west. It's my favorite burger joint west of the Mississippi."}
{"text":"Wow, if you dont like, then get back in your trailer and keep it moving! :)  By far the best burger you will get, fries and shake are good, but its the burger that makes it.  Theres a reason its pack all hours of the day and night!"}
{"text":"Best burgers. Always stop by when in town because not in East coast.  Double double protein style with grilled onions"}
{"text":"I enjoy most locations and this one was no different. The place was very clean and the staff was very friendly. Was not very busy at all, we got our order within 5 min. of sitting down. I was pleased with the quality of the food as well as the establishment as a whole. I would definitely come back here to eat again!"}
{"text":"Great place for a hamburger, fresh cut fries and shake. We love it here. Fries and burger are made fresh on the premise. You can taste the difference. They are always busy. You can have a \"protein\" style burger without the buns, and with lettuce instead. I always look forward to eating at this fast food joint wherever I can find it."}
{"text":"Good and cheap! Got the double double, the meat was grilled perfectly, but I still prefer Shake Shack."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. Well, except the line. Too many people go here to eat!! LOL"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. From the east coast and heard a lot about this place. Definitely lives up to what everyone says. Get the double double with fries and a milkshake and you won't be upset. Great staff keeps the long line moving. Limited seating but most people are moving in and out fast. Overall great place can't wait to get back."}
{"text":"This is a tough review to write because different things deserve different ratings.    The food: Five Stars, hands down.  I always get the grilled cheese with grilled onions (it's on their not-so-secret secret menu).    The space itself: One and a half stars.  Woah, wait, what?  This is In-N-Out, right?  What gives?    We stopped in here after spending 13 hours in the car (I wouldn't recommend doing this) and it was 9:30 on a Monday night.  We were exhausted and famished and we both knew In-N-Out would hit the spot.    Upon entering, we were greeted promptly and our order was taken precisely and in record time, and after that is when it all went downhill.  The lobby was a mess- the tables were dirty, trash everywhere and an employee went out to collect the empty baskets, but that was it- he didn't clean any tables!  I needed to relieve myself of the abundance of caffeine I'd consumed on the road and the women's restroom was even worse.  Both stalls were out of toilet paper (thanks, Mom, for always telling me to carry kleenex with me wherever I go!) and there was trash everywhere.  Seriously, I've seen cleaner restrooms at a gas station in Blythe.    Next time I'll probably just hit the drive through....."}
{"text":"The best thing about in and out is the staff! They are so polite and personable. The place is clean and everything happens quickly. The food is great, simple and fresh with a limited menu which is fine, because when you do something right you should do more of that! Prices are ridiculously good and they seem to have a steady stream of customers. Love the double double and the milk shakes. Fries from real potatoes cut right there....yum!"}
{"text":"I'm from Denver so we don't have any In-N-Outs' except for the one in Westminster that was open for what felt like a week. Thankfully I can come down here and satisfy my in-n-out needs while the company slowly grows eastward into colorado. Of all the places this company offers, this one is the best."}
{"text":"We love this place and this location never disappoints or messes up our wacky orders. Always clean and fast, too."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service!  Always consistently good burgers, staff pays attention to details and they give it 110%"}
{"text":"Love this place.  I always order a double double with cheese. Last time I had it wrapped in lettuce.  I asked that they not delete the sauce. ( I think they did when I ordered it a previously and I didn't like it). This time it was fabulous !! Their chocolate milk shake was so good!  Although I loved it, I won't be ordering it again. I checked out the carbs and it use my full days worth. Still, knowing this, I would not stop drinking it until it was completely gone . That's why I won't order it again.  Their fries are just ok to me.  They are fresh, not heavily salted, and pretty good when hot but they cool of fast and then I pass.  They have things available that are not on the menu. Think \"animal...,\""}
{"text":"every time i come to this location Jon (no H) ((whom typically closes)) is just so polite and amazing! he makes my in n out experience outstanding every time. luv u jon."}
{"text":"Vegetarian hubby asked for \"meat alternative\" and boy were we surprised by what he got. Imagine this: 2 leaves of lettuce with slices of tomato and onion. Thank goodness he took the onion option, eh? I WISH I HAD TAKEN A PICTURE TO SHARE but we were laughing so hard that I had tears and my stomach muscles were aching. Serves him right, eh? Anyway, this animal style used diced onions instead of sliced onions ago it was a little messier. The fries came with the animal style cheese and grilled onion mixture which might have been a good thing IF THE CHEESE HADN'T BEEN COAGULATED. The French fries were room temperature and not hot from the fryer. Humm, why did it take so long since it was not a busy time. Must have cooled sitting SOMEWHERE and not on our table :(.  Not a good experience this time. Maybe CA has different standards? None in HI so had to get one while we were there but wish we had gone for Mexican because this was a sad sub-standard In-N-Out :("}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out you always know what you are going to get. But at this location they have one gal taking the orders that does not know what animal style is. She gave me just a cheese burger last time and today we went here and she almost messed it up again."}
{"text":"I continue to try to understand the appeal of In-N-Out Burger.  Only at In-N-Out will you see a line of cars wrapped around the building in the drive-through line and line at the counter at 10:00 at night! Very clean and very old school.  Cheap prices.  The burger that everyone raves about, is just an under seasoned, thin, brown patty, enclosed in a soft doughy bun with iceberg lettuce. The fries, while very fresh, were sadly lacking flavor, like cardboard."}
{"text":"I come here every time I am on this side of town. The food is delicious and the customer service is top notch. I love this place like I love beating slaves."}
{"text":"Service is awesome, I think they train the staff on the most excellent customer service.   I go here for the food, but the customer service is the cherry on top.  Cabbed here, not quite sure if you can walk to the location.   Getting cabs back to the strip is also not that bad. The only bad thing is that sometimes you get higher order numbers getting their food first, but the wait is not unbearable.   Love the place!"}
{"text":"First time diner. Googled and found the secret menu. Animal style was very good!!    Affordable and fresh."}
{"text":"I'm posting this review to overwhelm all the other 1-star stinkers out there. You know who you are! Come on, people. 1-star reviews should be reserved for food that tastes like live bait or has squiggly hairs in it! If you don't like fast food hamburgers, then why the heck are you going to this place to begin with!??? Sheesh.  The quality and service at In-N-Out are always consistent. The ground beef is of average to above average quality, and they will cook your fries extra toasty if you want them to. They always get your order right... What's not to like? I only eat here about once a month, but I'm never unhappy when I do."}
{"text":"The king. You will not find many chains on here aside from a few regional ones, but this particular one can't be ignored. Not much to say about this burger, the price can't be beat anywhere in town to match the quality. Most fast food patties I wouldn't consider eating on their own, or even looking at too closely for that matter, but theirs are good no matter what. I'd almost venture to say it's real beef? The patties are never frozen, and supposedly they only locate their restaurants to within a certain driving distance of any food prepping location. The lettuce, tomato and sauce are all fresh, and almost even refreshing on the burger. I personally love the fries, although they're almost always cooked inconsistently throughout with some overdone, and some undercooked all in the mix. The fries are a bit of a controversy with most people I know, some people hate them, some love them. As for their flavor, think of those old school Potato Sticks. Still, for the value this meal can't be beat. You do get that slightly off stomach ache after a meal here that you don't necessarily get from higher end places, but I compel you to find something better for $6 all in. The shakes are great, the iced tea and lemonade are also good choices.  The secret menu adds a bit of mystique and makes for great articles all over the internet. And at times you almost feel like you're in an exclusive club when you order your fries 'Animal Style' or get a Neopolitan shake and the tourists next to you can't seem to find that verbage anywhere on the 3 item menu. You've all heard about the place, and it's a must on anyone's list if you travel to a city that has one."}
{"text":"Very busy and the air inside was heavy with grease but they were fast, friendly, and the food was, as always, delish!"}
{"text":"Love how happy your employees are! That says a lot about your restaurant! Food was great as always!!!"}
{"text":"Visited here on Friday, January 18th for lunch.  While the service was good and atmosphere clean, the burgers, fries and shakes were just average.  Probably try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"They have great burgers double double animal style!!! The best. Even when the drive through line is long they do a great job of moving the line! Love it one of my favs."}
{"text":"Love love in n out, always amazing. Best food for being fast food. Great double doubles and fries. Definitely fills a person up."}
{"text":"In-n-Out alone is a reason for me not to move back to the east coast. The food is the same each time I've gone. Delicious. I've gone probably six times since I've moved here. This is just a step up from anything I've experienced in Orlando, FL, another hot spot for high expectations in customer service. The only negative is sometimes have to wait a bit for food as the place is so packed. But I suppose that is something to expect if people keep coming back."}
{"text":"I'm an east coaster and the day In and Out comes here I will weep tears of joy. Since this is not happening ever, I will have to settle for eating here anytime I come to Vegas.  We ate here everyday for four days. Including a stop before we headed to the airport. I even got a burger for the plane ride.   The burgers are delicious and fresh. I do not like shoestring fries but that doesn't even matter.  Giant plus: it was immaculate/clean inside the restaurant.  Dear In-N-Out, I love you."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through, went home, and started eating, until I noticed one of the patties was raw pink inside, NASTY! I posted a pic as well"}
{"text":"I just love this place! If anybody asks me what I want for lunch, I always say In and Out. I especially love love love the sauce they put on the hamburgers!"}
{"text":"The best burger and fries.. and not just for fast food. I recommend getting your burger animal style. Oh yum!! The staff was so friendly! Nobody had the\"i hate my life\" look that has become the norm in most food service businesses."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is my favorite burger joint on the West Coast. Since White-Castle-Burgers r only available on the East Coast. The one on the strip doesn't count, it is a tourist trap with astronomical prices."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today.... yeah I like In-N-Out  Great customer service Very clean dining room Food was freshly made Polite staff  My all time favorite lunch place. Thanks"}
{"text":"The best! Friendly staff, which is rare for a staff full of high school kids. They always get my order correct. The food tastes the same every single time. The consistency is awesome. The place is clean as well. Drive thru is very fast!"}
{"text":"Ever since we heard that we are moving to Hawaii, my husband has asked to go to In n out almost weekly so he can get his fix before the big move!  This location is always really busy, but they keep it very clean and the staff is friendly.  I love that the burgers are not incredibly huge, so you can enjoy it without feeling stuffed.  Ask for their sauce on the side, and you can spread extra on your burger or have some for your fries :)"}
{"text":"I support  the idea that in-n-out is a great fast food restaurant for several reasons. First, in my opinion, in-n-out has a great quality of food. For example, the meat is prepared fresh everyday, so it will taste delicious. Also, French fries are prepared well everyday and it's the most fresh French fries I have ever eat. Second, I think the quality of service at in-n-out is high. For instance, the workers there are friendly. Finally, in my point of view, the price of range is low for a student. For example, all social classes can eat from it. In conclusion, I advice everybody to try it and I hope you like it."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan but must admit that there is something special about a double cheeseburger made \"Animal Style\"!  I do not come here often but when I do that's how I roll."}
{"text":"Always fast accurate and terrific.I enjoy dining here,, they such a simple menu, but it is always consistent."}
{"text":"Normally I love in and out, and most locations that I go to are pretty similar in quality and service, I've just had bad luck with this location in particular, the customer service is fine, but I've had experiences where they close earlier than they are supposed to, and most recently my boyfriend found a thick, dark, hair INSIDE the meat of his patty! Will probably be avoiding this one as much as I can."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty burger and the our server was really nice. I had everything on mine and something to do with \"the secret\" which means more stuff. Thousand Island dressing was yummy. However, 5 Guys is a much better burger. So if you have a choice... Go to 5 Guys."}
{"text":"Not the best- drive thru always seems so slow and bit into my burger only to bite into a big piece of hair. Fries to go are always soggy (no problem with different locations). So sad don't want to return to this location anymore."}
{"text":"You know you want it. Get your burger \"animal style\" (liquid cheese, grilled onions and burger cooked in mustard) and you'll be a happy fat boy like me!"}
{"text":"The food was bland and the fries were cold. To top that lol I had to wait over 20 mins for my food. I was dining in. Neatless to say I won't be back"}
{"text":"Very simply: best burger, best quality, best value, best service, and ALWAYS consistent.  This is the best burger chain . . . in North Las Vegas, Las Vegas, or anywhere . . . period."}
{"text":"Einer der besten Burger die ich jemals gegessen habe. Muss man probiert haben. Das Personal ist so unglaublich freundlich.   P.S: unbedingt die Animal Style Fries probieren"}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep trying to give In-N-Out a try. The food here is just meh... The burger is the only decent thing on the menu.  Fries: Suck Shakes: Suck Animal style it: Disgusting Protein/lettuce wrap/ Atkins friendly diet burger (WTF? don't come to In-N-Out for a diet you fatty): sucks"}
{"text":"Classic hand made burgers with the freshest ingredients. I have eaten In-N-Out burgers in 4 different states ad grew up on them in SoCal.  Food was very tasty and the produce was very fresh I had the fries cooked well done, they were crispy and hot Clean eating area Friendly staff Priced right where I can have a meal well under $10.   There may be more expensive hamburgers out there in the market place, but none will beat the made to order, fresh daily produce, nothing frozen, tasty flavor of In-N-Out. Thanks"}
{"text":"Burger was pretty good but lettuce was just packed on it.   Pretty good burger.  Fries were awful and gross.  Old and taste about day old and dry.    I would have asked for new ones but chaos in the restaurant.    Burger was good but did not come close to shake shack.  In and out good and shake shake Awesome.   Not even close"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this In-n-out numerous times because my co-worker lives over this way.  Whenever we are hungry and craving a fast bite, In-n-out never fails me. Always consistent with the food and the service. TOP NOTCH!!!  Ill take a double double hold the onions, fries and a lemonade.  Hard to believe something so simple is so good.  Easiest 5 stars ever!!!"}
{"text":"Double-Double Animal Style, fries, and chocolate shake. Nuff said. I can't get enough of In-N-Out when I'm on the West Coast."}
{"text":"Inn-n-out, what can I say?!?!?! It's my favorite burger, I dream of it, I crave it. First thing I do when I get off the plane at LAX, is head to Inn-n-out! If I'm ever anywhere within an hour of one, you bet I'm headed there.   So, when I realized there was one in Vegas during my last trip, you know I went!  I really think it's my favorite, because it's simple fresh ingredients, cooked to order, and inexpensive! Don't forget to ask for grilled onions on your burger, and get the fries well done! I'll walk out with two double-doubles and an order of fries for around $7! WOW!"}
{"text":"They burgers are always fresh and tasty , this location can get busy at times especially on the weekend, try your burger animal style you will love it if you like a burger with a secret sauce. Shakes are always good"}
{"text":"A must have whenever i visit Vegas. Double Double Animal Style and well done fries. Nuff said!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from the East Coast and when I came out to Vegas, I knew I had to hit up an In-N-Out. It was easy to get here from the strip via Taxi. The cab driver actually said he gets a ton of people from the strip who just want him to drive to In-N-Out. He was right as there were a ton of cabs cycling through the parking lot which made it easy to get one to drive us back to our hotel. I was ecstatic to try this place as I am a huge Five Guys fan and wanted to compare the two for myself.   I was so disappointed. When I order a hamburger, I am looking for something that I know is detrimental to my health. It's a hamburger! The burgers at Five Guys are greasy as hell and give me a stomach ache after I consume one. I ordered the animal here and it honestly just seemed too healthy to me. It was good but it didn't satisfy that burger craving. I can see how people like In-N-Out over Five Guys but it really just depends on personal preferences and I just happen to be on the other side of the fence."}
{"text":"Good quick food. More of a destination for tourists than a place I'd go repeatedly. Servings were a little small requiring me to order twice lol."}
{"text":"This place is great, LOVE IT!!! Try the animal style fires they are..DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"So, after years of hearing about In-N-Out, I finally decided to try it.  All fast food burgers are seen through the prism of Five Guys, so, with that in mind, I tried the basic, no frills, no quasi-secret menu hamburger, fries and chocolate shake.  The verdict:  not bad...not bad at all.  I'm still a Five Guys fanatic...there are times I would kill for a double with fried onions, jalapeños, relish and mustard...mmmmm...sorry, slipping into food fugue state...stay focused...  The burger was tasty and moist, the toppings and bun fresh.  The fries were okay (The use of peanut oil for Five Guys fries really sets them apart) and the shake, while good, wasn't up the standards of another fast food franchise, Carl's Jr.    While my love - perhaps even unholy lust - for Five Guys (insert joke here...I'm not doing all the work for you) has not been shaken, In-N-Out makes a respectable burger and will be getting my business again.  Like the most satisfying fast food places - Five Guys, Canes - they focus on doing one thing - burgers - and doing it well.  I'm looking forward to trying an Animal Style next."}
{"text":"Went late on a Saturday night. The drive thru line was very long but went by super fast. I love it that the menu is so simple. The food is incredibly tasty. And don't forget the animal style sauce. It's addicting!!!"}
{"text":"Went here and omg....the drive thru line was soooo backed up. I can see why though. When I did manage to even get IN the drive thru, I was happily greeted. I LOVE their fries so much. I mean, where else can you get fresh made fries? I also got a chocolate shake. When I finally made it up to the first window to pay, again I was happily greeted. He was equally nice and prompt as the first guy. Then I got up to the second window and waited maybe 2 minutes and there was my food.   Pros of this visit: Everyone was super nice. Prompt service without feeling overly rushed Even though there were a lot of cars, flow of traffic was speedy. Fries tasted awesome (as always) Shake was ok  Cons of this visit: I arrived at rush hour so there was still a 30 minute drive through (Not their fault, but be warned.)  Fries could have been hotter"}
{"text":"Mcdonalds is way better. I'm getting the McShivers cuz I miss their fries compared to the nasty fries at in n out."}
{"text":"Love In-N-Out. Even tho the lines are always long they do a great job getting you In-N-Out, pun intended :)"}
{"text":"Love that the menu has three main choces, a hamburger, a cheeseburger or a double cheeseburger. Fries were great and saw a guy peeling, washing and cutting them up for frying up. Reasonable prices and great service. Seating looked to be tough but like the name of the joint most people were in and out."}
{"text":"I guess I am confused. I am from the east coast and had heard from so many people that I have to go to in-n-out. To be honest it was ok. It did not blow my mind like I was told it would. My advice is to pass in-n-out and go straight to Smash Burger. Now THEY have killer burgers!"}
{"text":"Great and fast service. I really like their Neapolitan shake."}
{"text":"Food is great. However, a manager named Yael (Can't remember the spelling on the name tag) was SO incredibly rude to the workers. During a 5 minute period when I ordered and waited for my food, she was sarcastic and degrading to two young people working the registers. The food may be good, but if you treat your staff like crap,  you lose me as a customer! Disgusting. Shame on you, Yael!"}
{"text":"The only thing that I would have liked better would have been if it would have been closer to campus.  Then again I'd probably have to get my Animal-style cheeseburger and Dr. Pepper EVERYDAY in that case and it would have been mobbed by even more students than it already was. On second thought I'm glad you were just far enough a way that I wasn't always broke as a joke, spending all my money on chocolate shakes.  I was even able to work on my math homework while I was there: DELICIOUS+cheap+quick = In-N-Out!"}
{"text":"Amazing stuff :))) I go 3/4 times a week when I visit Vegas . It hits the spot each time , quick service for the volume of people that go here ."}
{"text":"This a great place to go if you want good food that is also affordable. The menu just consists of burgers, fries, shakes, and soda. The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly and as quick as is possible. I highly recommend the Double Double Animal Style with fries. It is definitely among the top five burgers I have ever eaten. By the way that whole order, with a Coke only came to about $8.   The only caveat I would mention is that going there around Noon or 6 p.m. will guarantee a twenty to thirty minute wait and the possibility of nowhere to sit and eat."}
{"text":"Damnit. I read the first few reviews and I was whisked away to a far, far away dream land of crisp lettuce, animal style burgers, and fresh made potato fries!  Then I remembered I was a vegetarian for 3 of the 4 years I lived in Las Vegas. No problem, the off -menu grilled cheese (FYI, I had heard that they used to avoid cross contamination, but I believe they now have to make the grilled cheese on the same griddle as the meat - so keep that in mind if you're hard-core) is always a good simulacrum of In-n-Out goodness for vegetarians. The oozing melted cheese slices fondling the intricate crevasse created by the folds of the crisp lettuce and a layer of fresh piquant onions with that freshly sliced tomato and special sauce. Mmmmmm.......  Agreed. This is hands down one of the best fast food chain burger joints out there with everything made fresh to order. This ain't no Mickey D's!  Avoid this place during the lunch rush - esp. when UNLV's in session. Otherwise, it's best when you arrive a bit earlier (11am) or later in the afternoon (after 2pm). Also good after you've been trolling down Maryland Pkwy and the local bars across the street and just need something to soak up the ethanol (C&A, Freaking Frog, Yayo's, etc.)!"}
{"text":"You can always count on In n Out for a good in expensive meal. Their freshness and quality is significantly higher than is usual for a fast burger joint. If you want a good laugh, check out how much a Wendy's double costs compared to the In n Out double double. The double  double is under $4 where the Wendy's double is more than $6. In my opinion, In n Out is so much better."}
{"text":"Heard lot about this place. First time visit in west coast and was on bucket list. Finally tried it and cant put my expressions down here for their food. Amazing..if you are new n never tried it def. worth ur trip to this place"}
{"text":"Great burger (specially the protein style) but the worst drive thru wait time ever!!! I'm talking about be ready for 25mins plus."}
{"text":"When i go to california, I only have one thing i MUST do everytime, and that is to eat In-N-Out at least twice. yes, not once, but twice. Even if i'm there for a short weekend i have to have it twice. And Vegas was no exception.  I was staying at the Mandalay Bay, and i heard from people that it's walkable, but it was so hot (May '09) i didnt want to melt to death on my way there and not taste those amazing animal style fries before i die, so i took a cab. Got on the cab, didnt want to risk the cab driver driving away or keep the meter running, so we went through the drive thru and drove right back to the hotel. I dont think the round trip was more than $15, might have even been like $10. Either way, it was worth it.   My usual is double double animal style with animal style fries. At first i thought that the animal style fries would be over doing it, but i have to say if there is one bad thing about In-N-Out is their fries, kinda plain. I guess i'm just used to the greased up mcdonalds fries :P but when it's topped with cheese, thousand island-like dressing and grilled onions?? heaven.  gosh i'm drooling just thinking about them!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best. There are few businesses on planet Earth that give such incredible food & service at an unbeatable price, with a staff that is friendly but not so much that you start to think that they're covering up something.  The quality control here should be studied by all other businesses. By my calculations, I have eaten In N Out over 700 times. They have forgotten something on my order ONCE, and were extremely apologetic about it.  The food is always immensely satisfying. Few places scratch the itch like In N Out does.  Love you In N Out! You set the bar so high!"}
{"text":"I'm quite the seasoned veteran at in n out.  Always have had exceptional customer service as well as quality freshness of food.  I am extremely upset with the lack of customer service I received last two times I've been through the drive thru here.  First time girl was very rude and my food was awful. An in n out first for me. Ok bad night I'll try them again just let it go, but no I can't just let it go after tonight. I cruise up to the drive thru mouth watering as I'm ordering to constantly keep being cut off midway threw my sentence.  I honestly just got fed up and pulled up to the first drive thru window to pay with my heart pounding I was so annoyed.  This in n out in particular loves to rush customers and is known for not being very friendly.  I had to calm down, assess the situation, and say, \"Hey, what did I do wrong?\"   But is ordering a meal for me and my family so irritable to the pimply face unlv student taking my order he has to be so rude and keep cutting me off?  Apparently so, I say good day in n out off of maryland and trop I'll take my business to sunset and marks. You know when you're greeted and feel welcomed and you know when you're not.  That night in particular we didn't feel so welcomed.... Sincerely unsatisfied customer .... :("}
{"text":"The greatest ever...yum!! affordable, fresh and great service...for fast food its at the top of my list!!"}
{"text":"I got double double and side of animal fries. The burger was good but the fries is not as hot as it should be and very soggy. They were out of chili pepper and one of the workers said they would not be back until July because of the distributor didn't expect them to sell this quick. I'm not sure how true it is. It seems really weird that they will be out of chili pepper for a month."}
{"text":"Best burger in town. Went at 10:30 in the morning and still a short line in drive thru. Get the double. Cheese if you like. Great value for lunch or casual dinner."}
{"text":"My friend and I never had In N Out before and wanted it. We decided to drive cross country from Minnesota with the sole reason of tasting burgers from this franchise.   It took thousands of miles and about 5 days, but we made it and this burger was entirely worth the trip.   They even gave us paper hats."}
{"text":"In n Out... in n out... THATS WHAT A HAMMMBURGERS ALLL ABOUT!!! I love this place!!! burgers are great and so is the Neapolitan shake mmmm"}
{"text":"Worst service ever employees had friends that came in after I ordered and they got their food before I did I mean 17 minutes for two burgers and a fry come on"}
{"text":"I only have great things to say about this company! This location is very clean, staff are friendly and their overall company customer service is great!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing special burger-wise but the very pleasant older gentleman working the dining room made my 21 year old daughter's day by stopping at our table to chat & giving her a paper In N Out hat. The chocolate & vanilla milkshakes were delicious though!"}
{"text":"I always love a double double, or anything else at In-N-Out, but this location is pretty gross. It was all I could do to finish my food with all the flies buzzing around."}
{"text":"Before we moved to Vegas, I had never even heard of this place. Now, we tee everyone that comes to visit us to eat here. It is Amazing!! Be sure to order your burger \"animal style.\" Delicious!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out, good as always. The company store is actually located right next door. This location is sooo busy! They should just open another In-N-Out right next to it.  -1 star for the ridiculous line and wait for the food"}
{"text":"The employees are always friendly and personable. Quick service, good value and the best fries out there! Hard to beat."}
{"text":"How much or how little can I say??? Its In-N-Out!!! And we don't have them in Chicago. #1 Animal Style really hit the spot after a long morning of travelling. Great cashier and quick service! It made me happy at 11am! :-)"}
{"text":"I do not eat fast food.  i do eat at in-n-out.  mmmm double double animal style"}
{"text":"There are no In-N-Out burgers in NYC.  Read on Yelp and saw the 4 stars rating.  Really? Could the burgers be That Good? Hummm.. Intrigued...   My friend really wanted to try In-N-Out and so we went. Took the RTC bus 201 on Tropicana Rd.  Took us across the high way.  In-N-Out is right there.  Cannot miss it.  Convenient.    The burgers were yummy.  Fries were a little bit different, but its a good different.  Fries were cut thinly like McDonald's. They were crispy, but not greasy. There is a nice texture to it.  Its made fresh from Idaho potatoes.   Overall, In-N-Out reminds me of 5 guys.  Fast food joints that specialized in burgers.  So, if you are craving for CHEAP, but GOOD burgers go to In-N-Out.    This place is SUPER popular.  There were TWO long lines that snaked around the restaurant.  One line is to order.  The other is to wait for the food.  The Drive-Thru line wasn't any better.  Cars were lined up and waiting for their food.  Wow!!   Customers waited calmly and patiently for their food.  No one argued or acted out.  Usually, people get testy when they have to wait for their food. Phenomenal!!  Its a fast food place and there were tons of people there.  So, the restrooms must be super nasty correct? WRONG.  The restrooms were super clean and tidy.  Amazing!  Cheers to Yummy & CHEAP burgers!  Viva Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Always great service and good food. Definitely try the \"double double animal style\" if you don't like bread try it \"protein style\" (no buns). They are open fairly late so it's convenient when you are hungry after work or a night of drinking!"}
{"text":"Hands down the champ of fast food burgers...fast, Fresh, FABULOUS!!  The reason I rent a car in a town where cabs/trams/moving walkways rule...i gotta have a ride to In N Out!  double double grizzly style...grrrrrrrrrrrrr!  anyone wanna drive down to cali/nevada and go get one now?!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of IN-N-OUT my whole life growing up in SoCal.  I was pleasantly surprised to find one here when I moved my family to AZ.  One thing is for sure you will never find an IN-N-OUT empty!!  They are a model of how a successful business should be run.  Excellent customer service and a quality product.  There's just no substitute."}
{"text":"First off I obviously like everyone else I love in N out..... In theory this should be a negative review because they did get my order incorrect when there were extra onions in Place of no onions on my burger. However when I called to inform them of the mistake after I already made it home, The hotline not only apologized profusely but actually sent out a certificate for a free meal covering everything I ordered directly to my house. What's nice is I don't have to go back to that same location, being that I have one that is closer to my work and house. Anyhow great job guys!!! I know things get messed up sometimes, so I'm not complaining about that. You did take the extra steps to correct everything and I am very satisfied. 5 stars always!"}
{"text":"WHY oh WHY do they not have a single decent hamburger joint in Chicago!!!!   I was just at in n out last weekend with a friend and stuffed my face with glorious greasy in n out burger and animal styled fries.... mmm artery clogging deliciousness. I love this place. Its timeless, you go back after a week, a month, a year, the quality is still spot on, you get exactly what you ordered- and that is what makes this place what it is.  I cant wait to come back."}
{"text":"Came for a bite since we just watched UFC 191! It's pretty packed in here but they are fast, the food looks good and its a great atmosphere! By far the most occupied burger place by the strip! Since it is busy there is limited seating but its not that bad people are coming and going! It is fastfood! Just dont be stingy with the spread!! Sharing is caring!"}
{"text":"It seems like people either hate this place or love this place, and all I can say is that I am a fan! If are going to go healthy and want fast food In N Out is one of the healthier fast food places, because of the fresh meat never frozen, fries are cut in the back and cooked in non cholesterol oil and everything is fresh it is truly quality you could taste, and by the way animal style fries are the best thing on the secret menu."}
{"text":"First Off I have to say I was forced by a friend to revisit In & Out Burger since I didn't like it very much in the past.  This time I had a Double Double Animal Style, a cheese burger, french fries, and a chocolate milk shake.  I started with the Double Double.  This Burger rates right up there with the finer establishments on taste and is a great value.  The sauce and onions are excellent there was an appropriate amount of condiments to were you could still eat it without having to worry the majority of your meal was going to end up in your lap.  The cheese burger on the other hand was inline with my previous visits and it just didn't make the cut.  If you are going to go to In & Out have it animal style or go someplace else...end of story.  The fries were okay for fresh cut...not addictive, but not horrible.  In my opinion they could use some more salt, thickness, crispiness, flare, something.  The Chocolate shake was above average and I would probably get again.  The only thing is I would enjoy more shake and less of a creamy feeling, just didn't have the sustenance that I come to expect from a Chocolate Shake, kinda tasted like fluff, if that makes sense.  Over all 4 stars for the Animal Style, and the fries and shake didn't detract from the score."}
{"text":"It look forever to get our food. And then the fries were hard and cold.  My burger was just ok.  I'm really disappointed.  I hope it's just this location."}
{"text":"NOMNOMNOM In-N-Out Burger is always good :) Something that is on their secret menu is \"Animal Style\". You get your burger and fries with cheese, grilled onions, and  thousand island sauce--SO GOOD!! This location was very quick and friendly :)"}
{"text":"There burgers are ok ...for fresh fries,they  need more salt.."}
{"text":"i think this place is really overrated. the menu is extremely limited and small. it has to be the smallest menu of any fast food place. the food is fairly boring. their buger tastes very similar to a whopper but is much smaller. prices are a little high for what you get. just ok place."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong. My family loves coming here. My kids love a plain grilled cheese though the highlight for them is the paper hat! In-N-Out never disappoints. I am in love with their strawberry shakes- that alone is well worth the trip."}
{"text":"I get to Las Vegas more than the West Coast nowadays so this joint deserves a mandatory visit.  Looks like every other In N' Out.  Tastes like every other In N' Out.  Damn good.  Check out my added photo of my animal style double double and animal style fries!"}
{"text":"I simply don't eat fast food.... EXCEPT for In-N-Out!  Made to order and you can see them cutting the potatoes in the drive-thru window! Check out the website for special requests they don't offer on the menu... my fav is the gorilla style (grilled onions with a touch of mustard). A bite into the burger with the combo of crisp fresh lettuce and burger it is soooo good. For the price, quality and service,,, yes SERVICE (friendly, fast and accurate) it is the BEST."}
{"text":"Since we were in Vegas and I have never had In-N-Out this was a must to visit.  I really really wanted to love In-N-Out but something was missing, the burger patty itself was so skimpy and lacking the flavor I was hoping it would have.  It was just OK.  The fries were just meh, nothing special.  Shake Shack and Five Guys are both better in quality and taste by a long shot IMO."}
{"text":"I love IN-N-OUT Burger! I'd say, the best and healthiest fast food place around."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about this place, so when we came to visit, this was on my list of things to do.  I have to say that I was really disappointed with this experience.  The hamburger I had was nothing special, and the fries were just awful. I gave this a 2, as I was able to at least eat it, if not enjoy it."}
{"text":"Two stars only because the fries were decent. I hate the thousand island taste of their spread and they do not have mayo. The burger was strictly ok. I really have no idea what all the hype is about other than some people like lots of stuff on their burger. If you like a simple burger that's juicy and offers lots of topping choices and the best fries, go to five guys instead. The wait there is must shorter and much better food."}
{"text":"INTERNAL MEMO   To our valued employees, You are the most integral part of what makes our company wonderful. We want to continue to show our appreciation for all that you do, and that includes the overwhelming number of suggestions we received for our upcoming 60th anniversary.   The management team must admit the diversity and scope of the ideas surprised us, but we feel that it is reflection of our talented work force.   For example, the suggestion that we close our indoor seating to mimic how our original store in 1948 would serve customers is not feasible. In-N-Out now operates in locales which have inclement weather compared to Southern California, and we believe our customers value this change. Moreover, many of our stores are so busy as to displace a significant amount of our customer base.   Along those lines, we are also are unable to implement the suggestion that we separate our customers into two separate lines, one marked \"colored\" and one marked \"white\" despite how common this was in 1948. In-N-Out's popularity already ensures that lines are often long, and tests the patience of many consumers. We also are uncertain that our African-American, Asian-American, and Latin American customers would find such a decision compatible with In-N-Out's desire to remain inclusive to the largest market share possible.   We also are opposed to adjusting our current portion size to what it was in 1948. It is our opinion that customers would probably notice that we have made our buns bigger, patties thinner, and cheese oilier over the years. Moreover, it is the position of management that importing soft drinks sweetened without corn syrup may be a violation of US law and therefore an unacceptable risk for the company.   Lastly, we believe that lowering our prices to those charged by In-N-Out in 1948 is also not feasible. We believe that such tactics are the sign of desperation and not the hallmark of a healthy and aggressive brand and company. Moreover, this might be viewed as a In-N-Out conceding it is no longer the bargain it once was. The management team strongly disputes this, recently price increases notwithstanding. We also have reason to believe that such a move would be viewed unfavorable as we explore our potential IPO next year.   In closing, we continue to believe that our employees are our greatest asset. We thank you for your input on this momentous occasion in our company's history and encourage your feedback in the future. Sincerely, Your Management Team"}
{"text":"After reading some of the other reviews, I have to defend In-N-Out. If you want a good burger and fries, you have arrived at the right place.  Great milkshakes, too.  As a female friend of mine once declared \"good hangover food\". I usually go through the drive-through, but the wait can be quite long.  One good policy change they adopted was to accept credit cards.  About a year ago, they were a cash-only business and I can't tell you how many times I saw people drive up to the payment window (at the drive through) and drive off without their food because they only had a credit card to pay with.  In this day and age, I would think a business would have to accept credit cards just to survive."}
{"text":"I ordered a protein burger and it was great!  The team was super friendly and helpful! They showed me where to look for the \"secret menu\" too. There were several customers in line and in the drive thru line, but the team seemed to control the pace of the everything and managed the stressful situation well! I will go back for more food in the future."}
{"text":"Everyone here is working hard and they all have smiles on their face. A great team of helpful, dedicated workers! We were on a long road trip and my sister had to rinse out my niece's and nephew's bottles in the bathroom sink. One of the employees kindly offered to go in the back and clean them for her. She came back quickly with the bottles wrapped nicely in a box and placed in a bag. Of course the food was delicious, and even though the line was very long, we waited only for a short time. The only bummer is that the eating area is pretty small. Even though it was really busy, everything was stocked up and full. Great place!"}
{"text":"Fast food burger the way it's meant to taste.  Fresh beef and lettuce and non-frozen potato fries with a super thick vanilla shake to fill out any remaining empty spots in my stomach.   And as a frosting on an already yummy cake, it's open till late too."}
{"text":"Yummy !!! Always a favorite place to go to when in town. How can something so simple be so delicious, and yet sometimes overrated but since Oregon doesn't have the chain, I always have to indulge when possible. :)"}
{"text":"Let's face it, this is the best fast food place on earth. Nothing more needs to be said."}
{"text":"Seriously, what is all the hype about?   The fries have no flavor and are soggy.  The burgers are bland.  Special sauce?  What's so special about a ketchup-mayo-mustard-relish mix?   I'm sorry, but I'd rather have a Wendy's burger any day."}
{"text":"4 Words....DOUBLE DOUBLE ANIMAL STYLE.....!!    It is just the most DELISH Burger Goodness You Will Ever Put In Your Mouth!!  You Should Get The Fries Animal Style Too...BUTTT...Plan To Share With Your Fave Friend....B/C Otherwise You Will Be Too Stuffed To Finish Them!!    I Love The Tropicana Location For 2 Reasons....The First Being The Staff Is Totally Fun and Helpful....and The Second and Deciding Vote Is B/c The Staff Is TOTALLY SMOKING HOT!!   :-)  Why Lie?  It's Yelp??!!  All In and Out Have Great Customer Service....But Not All Have A SMOKING HOT STAFF......  So Really, If I Can Stuff My Face With DELISH BURGER GOODNESS (Across The Parking Lot In Front Of The Retail Store) and STARE At Hot Boys.....Why Would I Go Anywhere Else??!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, best fast food burger I have ever had by far. Being from Seattle, I pray every night that they will build one down here. The bun itself is spectacular, best fast food bun I have had. The party is charbroiled and seasoned to perfection. I love how the veggies are so fresh, as defiantly get it animal style. More than worth the price. One double double is under $4, I WAS BASICALLY ROBBING THEM. I have had sit down burgers that don't even compare to this. The fries weren't so great, but it still gets 5 stars because the burger is that GREAT, and the food overall was pretty cheap, and I am dreaming of the next time I get to eat in and out again, absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"All I can say is oh yea....Best Fast Food Burger. Awesome!!!! Double burger animal style"}
{"text":"I always go to this in n out burger considering it is the closest one to my house. They normally do a great job but tonight was a different story. I went through the drive through, ordered an animal fry along with another meal. The girl at the window first forgets to give me an animal fry so I have to wait for her to do that. Then once she hands me the box which is supposed to have fries in it, I drive home, which is 20 minutes away. I get home and come to realize there is 2 plain burger patties in my animal box. So, I drive ALL the way back to this location and explain what the problem was. When I showed the clerk she says \"Oh there those are!\" No apology, no attempt at compensation. I work in customer service and I know that is not a way to make right for mistakes that are made."}
{"text":"Great service from Orlando. Kindly offered water while we waited for our to go burgers. I've always had to ask elsewhere. Very appreciated. Food was fast & good. I love this place. Nothing fancy but the best fast food service. Love the scripture quotes. Subtle but also appreciated."}
{"text":"Ich war 2013 da und muss sagen das ich schwer beeindruckt war. Super lecker, Service ebenfalls super. Der Laden war total überfüllt und es ging trotzdem sehr zügig. Ich kann ihn nur empfehlen. Bei mir ist in and out auf Platz 2 bei allen Burgerläden."}
{"text":"Honestly the burgers are pretty good and the fries are so-so, but I'm not a big fan of this place. I feel like you can get a better burger elsewhere."}
{"text":"You can see a man in back cutting fresh potatoes to fry.  French style.  I'm sure somewhere back there there are other workers cutting more fresh ingredients ( I feel bad for whoever got stuck with onions) because that's what it tasted like to me.  It was a clean environment and staffed enough so the line moved quickly."}
{"text":"Having grown up in the Southeast where In N Out does not exist, I never understood why this place has a cult-like following. I'd see such excited social media posts with lots of pictures any time someone ate at one of these restaurants, which seemed no different than any other fast food burger joint. That's why I hadn't bothered to try In N Out, despite living in Arizona for the past 7-8 months. I must say, after visiting this location on a late Sunday afternoon, I have a better appreciation for this place. Not even taking the food into consideration, I was very impressed by how many staff members were working at the time - legitimately working. Everyone was seriously busy the entire time and providing excellent customer service. The restaurant looked very clean and I liked the transparency of being able to see right into the kitchen. Nothing was \"hidden\". Where else do you get to watch potatoes getting cut into fresh fries? Also, they seemed to really care about the presentation of their food. Which by the way, my cheeseburger was very good and I liked that I could get the onions sauteed. As a first-timer, I found the menu a little confusing (despite how completely basic it appears) because my friend was explaining all the crazy ways you can order. It's like a secret language I don't know - but want to learn. I kept it very simple this time, but would definitely come back here before ever going to Burger King or any other similar place ever again."}
{"text":"This location seems to be the fastest  so if your heading south on the 15 it's best to stop here and not at the Tropicana location because that one gets really packed and the drive thru can be a nightmare very long waits.  But this one is fast even if drive thru is full. If you go inside it seems to take forever. Good luck on your visit."}
{"text":"This location wowed me with the extremely friendly staff and everyone was smiling-a diamond in an industrial part of town.  What can I say about the food . . .always exactly the same."}
{"text":"I really hope the manager of this location reads this. We got here at lunchtime and the place was SLAMMED a line out the door and a full dining room and patio.  The staff had no problem keeping up! We received our order in a few minutes! I even forgot my sons burger (oops) went up to the counter with my receipt and card the cashier had no problems adding it to my ticket and my order coming out correctly! As a bonus the dining room and restroom was super clean! Pat your employees on the back!"}
{"text":"This place has always had great service every time I eat there. Keep up the good work! I highly recommend adding grilled onions and chopped peppers to your burger...delicioso!!!"}
{"text":"F*cking love this place every time! Protein style booooi!  Healthy fast food. Nom nom nom"}
{"text":"Always good and always delivered with a friendly smile. Gotta love that!"}
{"text":"I'm simple cheese burger, fries well done, with a vanilla shake kind of gal. They always get my order correct and in a timely manner. I never seem to be disappointed! I always take my visiting family members here and they love it:) My only complaint is when I ask for military discount they state they only do law enforcement. Usually people consider it one in the same and offer the discount for there service. I know it's not the stores fault but just wanted to mention it."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here and see what the hype was all about.  Very crowded drive thru which meant the food was immaculate or the service was terrible. Went inside and it was crowded as well but the service was great, food was great, prices was really good for what you get. They work really fast in there and people are moving in and out quickly. I recommend if you haven't tried it yet"}
{"text":"Ok we came here on a Wednesday  and the lines was long we almost turned around, but the line was moving fast. It was probably 15 people ahead of me and it took 3 mins for me to place my order. Staff friendly. The burger was delicious. The fries are nasty. Just hard, thin,and no taste whatsoever. The place was packed, but we managed to get a table. Definitely would go back. Only for the burgers and milkshakes."}
{"text":"Damn you In-N-Out Burger !   You broke my 1 year 3 month sobriety (or in this case non fast food eating diet)  I came to Vegas and couldn't resist this fabulous place.  I don't feel too guilty though, this place is worth it.  It would be a problem if I lived where they had In-N-Out Burgers, I'd probably have to start going to FFA ( Fast Food Anonymous) meetings nightly.  The only quasi fast food joints I go to anymore are Jimmy Johns and Chipotle, .... oh and In-N-Out Burger damn!"}
{"text":"Apparently \"animal style\" fries are all the rage at this In-N-Out Burger...I hardly saw a customer walk by without their fries smothered in cheese, grilled onions and secret sauce.  Definitely my first time every experiencing this phenomenon, and I happen to be a long time patron of the In-N-Out establishment.  Ya learn something new everyday...."}
{"text":"There's a ton of hype around In-N-Out-Burger...I swear it's like a legend or something to people in California and Arizona. I'm not a huge fan of fast food but even I was persuaded by all the tails of the amazing In-N-Out-Burger. Could it really be that good? It's a burger...  I ordered the cheese burger and side of fries and to my surprise I could taste the potato in the fries. LOL I guess I'm only used the fries tasting like grease so this was actually pretty cool to me. Back to the burger - the meat was cooked just right but I think what makes their burgers so special is the toasted bun! Yeah, I know I'm supposed to say the meat patty but I think the secret really is in the bun. It was perfectly toasted and didn't get soggy from the tomato or juicy burger.  Have I joined the In-N-Out-Burger cult? Uhm, no not just yet but I'd be willing to bet if I had another I might just cave."}
{"text":"Burgers were pretty good. The chips weren't that impressive though. Would return if I needed a quick feed."}
{"text":"In-&-Out Burgers are the best.  The freshest burgers you can find. Just wish they would move to my area of the country."}
{"text":"Just had a great experience here.  Not a first timer of course, and this one had to be special for some reason.  We were on the way back to the airport after running in the Vegas Marathon and decided to go to In-N-Out.  So we told the cabbie to go and drop us off and wait.  He said, don't worry about it we'll get drive-thru.  It was the greatest cab ride ever!  Delicious Double-Double and a ride to the airport.  We bought him a burger of course and tipped him nicely.  The only reason why they get 4 instead of 5 is the fries.  They aren't anything to write home about.  Or write on yelp about for that matter.  Except to say that they are sub par of course."}
{"text":"Great food, good atmosphere!  And best of all great prices!  Stayed at the Silverton right next door, this is half the price of Jonny Rockets!"}
{"text":"In n Out is the best burger, hands down, out of any fast food joint. The meat is fresh, the buns are toasted, French fries are made on the spot. Amazing. This is my all time favorite cheeseburger. Animal style! They are always busy but the lines move fast. Also extremely reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This particular location is amazing, the food is always fresh and fantastic.  The employees are ridiculously polite and efficient and it is very, very clean.  We almost always end up here when eating out, the service is just as good as the food and the food is AMAZING for a burger joint!  Also, there is no complaining on the price."}
{"text":"I'm glad I read the reviews, I never knew they you can get your burgers \"animal style.\"   Too bad the shake machine was broken when I went.  If you stayed at the Excalibur like me you can walk to this location.  Try not to walk alone though."}
{"text":"Get. In. Mah. Belly!   Oh where to begin the ode to In and Out? How about the fact that the meat is fresh and the french fries are freshly cut? Oh, I missed you In and Out! And all the veggies are fresh too? AND the milkshakes are just flat out delish?   Be prepared for many people to share your space, as most likely they share the desire for these delicious burgers. For the same reason, there is usually a line. What is nice about all of this, is the fact that even though it is super busy, the service is still great! People are friendly, and the food is still fresh when you get it.   If you're looking for Chicken or Tofu, this is not the place.   And if you don't feel like going inside, consider the drive through. As you are patiently waiting, there is a massive window allowing you a front row view into the kitchen. Makes me feel a bit like a stalker, but surprisingly entertaining. You will feel as though you are waiting for your last meal on earth...but then again, it may as well be."}
{"text":"Personally I don't think their burgers are as amazing as everyone says they are, but I respect In N Out for keeping their prices low and affordable and for allowing a great variety of burger customization (sometimes I'll get a 4x3, Animal Style, or Double-Double... depends on the mood).  But, their animal style fries are ridiculously worth the hype. I really recommend giving these a try. Regular fries are alright, I usually order them well done.  I was quite mad that they forgot about my order to the point where I had to go up to them and remind them about it, but mistakes happen, and the people who work there are extremely kind and charming. And once again, you can't go wrong with the prices. For a double double, animal style fries, and a milkshake, I spent about $11. At Shake Shack, one specialty burger is already $10.  Lots of respect to In N Out. No doubt I'll be coming back when I need a quick bite."}
{"text":"Nothing beats a #1 with grilled onions, no tomatoes, well done french fries and a pink lemonade. I've been known to eat here twice to three times a week and find absolutely nothing wrong with that. There's magic in those delicious burgers, just one bite and you are instantly transported to a world of savory goodness unmatched anywhere else on this little blue marble we call Earth."}
{"text":"Omg is this heaven !!! I Love In & Out !! It's cheap & delicious ! I wish we had one back in Colorado :( !! Every time we go to Vegas this is always our first stop. I like ordering the Double - Double & Well Done fries Animal style ! Once your taste buds taste the food you will be craving more & more !! Their milkshakes are amazing too !   So if you're in Vegas stop around, In & Out its worth it !"}
{"text":"Buffets are for old people!  Picture it, you wake up with a touch of the shakes from all the Bacardi 151 they put in every drink you had last night....your in a fog, your head hurts, and your stomach feels like the floor of frat house after homecoming. Are you really in the mood for a run of the mill buffet?  The answer should be a resounding no....you need something greasy and delicious and you need it as fast as humanly possible. In said situation In and Out burger will call to you like a beacon of greasy joy! There menu is simple burger or double burger, cheese or no cheese, and simple is good when you have a touch of the shakes.  The food is fast even though the line is out to the street you still get a decent response time. All in all its one of the best burgers for the price I have ever had! I highly recommend In and Out!"}
{"text":"Bomb ass burgers off course. Great fries. Hate the long line."}
{"text":"I rarely eat fast food but when I do, this is my go-to! My husband and I take our grandkids here for a treat. I believe the person who took our order was named Sarah. Staff was friendly and helpful. My grandson is allergic to cheese and they were great at accommodating. Must try the Neapolitan shake."}
{"text":"BEST QUICK SERVICE BURGER. Simple menu done right burgers, shakes and fries. I've had shake shack and always hear rumbling that they are better or in-n-outs main competition, don't think so a double double meal is below $8 while a \"meal\" a la carte at shake shake sits near $15. This location specifically has never disappointed and will continue to make this my go to burger spot."}
{"text":"I got the double double burger.  Very good burger, in fact it is better than McDonalds, Burger King, and Carls Jr.  No kidding."}
{"text":"My first time having the dinner in the car from here. Snh I wish I were born in te '50s"}
{"text":"OK guys. The food is above average but this is still just a fast food place. The burgers and fries off a limited menu are a step or 2 above MacDonald's or Burger king but its not heaven. Burgers are a bit dry. And fries can get softy. For a quick fast meal it's fine. But to fly here and stop here before you guys go to your hotel? No way"}
{"text":"If there was a zero I would put that instead. I eat healthy, and have not been to a fast food drive through within the last 10 years.  I only went to In-N-Out Burger because my daughter wanted to eat burgers for dinner and I had made a deal with her earlier in the evening about it. The guy who took my order while waiting in the long drive thru line was really nice. However when I got to the drive through windows things changed. There was no one at the first window and I did not happen to see a sign for paying there, so I kept driving to the next window to pay and get the food.   When I got to the second window I was greeted with a dark haired Latina looking or Asian girl with thick glasses and bright red lipstick and no smile who said \"You did not pay.\" Naturally I did not know what to say because I was going to pay for my cheap junk food at the second window. So I said \"Can't I pay here?\" I'm not sure if she thought I was trying to steal food or if she was trying to discipline a disobedient kid.  \"No you cannot pay here you have to pay at the first window!\" And I said I would like to just pay here, and I had my card in my hand and she said \"No you have to pay at the first window.\" At Dutch Bros and Starbucks people pay and get their food at the same window so why does In & Out Burger have some sort of autocratic drive thru situation? It was super weird because it seemed like she was asking me to physically get out of my car and go to the first window, or back my car up or something. Keep in mind I have already been waiting in line for about 15 minutes or more. Finally, after trying to humiliate me for not paying at a different window, she took my card and ran it, even though it must have been super inconvenient because she had to walk to where the first window was.  She, or someone, should have apologized for the act she pulled. Now I know why I don't go to fast food places anymore, and it's the shitty attitude of employees, not the bad quality of the food."}
{"text":"Love there burgers best fast food fries in my opinion love going here for quick burger"}
{"text":"It was ok I guess...not sure what all the hype is about.  No bacon was a bummer and my wife likes bbq sauce which they also don't have.  Price was good, burger was fresh and hot, so I guess that explains the popularity.  I'm told the fries take some getting used to - I found them very starchy.  Not bad, just not to my taste I suppose.  They had milk, but no apple juice for the kids by the way."}
{"text":"Probably the quickest and cheapest bite on the strip. Perfect for quick lunch but very very packed even in weekdays"}
{"text":"I've only gone through the drive through BUT they never mess it up! Always yummy! Of course it can get busy because 1. it's in n out & 2. it's right off of the 10!"}
{"text":"I like to think that an In-N-Out burger is what a krabby patty burger would taste like, AMAZING.  Fast food is hard to come by that is truly quality and not just quantity.   Recommendation: If you are in Arizona or by one, GO!"}
{"text":"You have great cleanliness. You are fast to get the food out. It is always fresh, I like that we can see what you are doing in the drive thru."}
{"text":"Not good at all, you will be better off going to McDonald's.  Horrible fries, the hamburgers are mediocre .   Am I coming back to this place?  Nope."}
{"text":"Excellent service especially from very young employees. These kids are so respectful and our orders are always correct. Super fast service. Great food. Perfect portions for really cheap!! Best burger place around!!!"}
{"text":"I've gone to In-N-Out Burger 3 times.  And each time I had to wait 20 min for my order.  Aside from that long wait the fries tasted weird. Weird in a gross way.  Third time was not the charm and I will NEVER go back!"}
{"text":"Fast Friendly service despite long line. Great product and nice and simple menu. Good job in and out burger!"}
{"text":"Love this place, burgers always fresh and hot.Animal fries are great but need to ask for extra sauce.A little hard to get in and out of the parking lot on some days.Yes they have a loyal customer in me. Staff is great very friendly and lots of smiles to go around."}
{"text":"Maybe it is just this particular In-N-Out but the burgers were blah and boring.  I seem to recall having better ones at the In-N-Out in California. Not worth the hype or the calories."}
{"text":"What can I say, I love this location because its closest to my home. The staff is friendly like all locations and the food is made to order of course. I always get a double double \"animal style\" but hold the tomatoes and pickles, yuk. But it's the best!, I can't eat it any other way you got to try it if you haven't, it's off the menu you so you have to mention that."}
{"text":"This is what i was waiting for for 7 years!!!!!  and i took the cab to get me there... it was SOOOO worth it just like i remembered the burger was just so good, don't know why but it is. i had to get new fries because the ones i got were not fresh, im glad i did because that made it great!!! since i first tried one in LA and knowing that there was one off the strip , when i booked by LV vacation that was one place that was a must!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered via the drive thru - the number 2 (fitting because that's what it was - excrement) cheeseburger, fries and a diet.   Didn't open the order till I was on the highway or I would have brought it back. The burger was practically raw, the fries were like chalk - the  texture was powder like.  And the Diet Coke had no flavor - it was just carbonated water.  Now, the staff was friendly but, how can there be this level of inattention to detail?   Are they not trained?   I understand that you can miss once in awhile but, the entire order was shit.  Was really looking forward to \"In-N-Out\" but this was terrible and will never go to this location again."}
{"text":"I come here whenever I am in the mood for hamburger and when ever i have people in town. I do not eat at any other fast food joints but atleast I can trust that in and out burger will have fresh food without the additives. Great place, great burger!"}
{"text":"Going inside to order is much faster than waiting at the drive-thru. Friendly staff. Clean. I love in n out burgers."}
{"text":"Cold, stale fries, thin meat patties. Next time I'll go to White Castle."}
{"text":"Love this in n out. Only complaint is there is ALWAYS a long drive thru line. They do a good job getting thru it but if you only have a few minutes maybe inside would be quicker. Staff is friendly and kind. A few IN N OUT HACKS--- get the fries \"well done\" and they make them extra crispy I swear it makes them 10x better. If you want a \"healthier\" choice- get it protein style. They make the burger with no bun and wrap it in lettuce instead. Very tasty! When bringing kids - you can ask for the burger to be cut in half so you can split the burger rather than having to buy separate burgers when little kids typically can't eat a whole one anyways! This next one isn't really a hack more of just a recommendation- if you get a soda get half there homemade pink lemonade (delicious as is) and add half Sprite/ 7-up! Super yum!"}
{"text":"I always have a good experience at this restaurant. Today's visit happened to be one of the best I've had. The food was as good as usual but the service was over the top. The man at the register this morning when they opened was very helpful, even beyond the ordering transaction. I dropped my cup before I filled it and he was right there with a new one without asking. He was great with my young boys and also gave them paper hats on the way out. This location is great keep it up."}
{"text":"Love Love Love...........nom nom only one little hiccup.......the shakes were very foamy.....not thick and creamy like other in n outs ......."}
{"text":"Being a SoCal gal born and bred, I'm a die-hard in-n-out addict. Eating it makes me think of home, and summers at the beach. The quality cannot be touched by any \"fast food\" place, both on service and food. My only slight complaint is that everything is cooked to order, fresh and delicious, so there's a wait in the drive thru and inside. A small price to pay, for perfection."}
{"text":"How I love your burgers so,  your french fries are delightful.   It's flattering for my waistline  that I eat you only on West Coast time."}
{"text":"I have been there almost every time I go to the market on Sunset Road. I love their French Fries, the Iced Tea and the combo number 1 without cheese. Great price, great food and quick service. It is always crowded."}
{"text":"Always good- sometimes the fries are terrible, but last time I went there they were perfect! If you guys read this- please keep making them longer and softer! Tiny bits of burnt fries are a no no!"}
{"text":"I have been to Vegas 13X and finally on my last trip I checked out this particular In N Out since I have passed by so many times.  SOOO glad I made the cabbie stop there from the airport to the hotel.  I love my Double Double, Animal Style!"}
{"text":"I ordered a double double meal with a chocolate shake. Burger was great, shake was great, fries were so so. I'm always satisfied with their burger game, but not French fry game."}
{"text":"always good tasty burgers and awesome animal fries. The shakes are good and big. You can taste the freshness of the fires and burgers. The bad: always a line at lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Slowest in and out I have ever been to. I've been to locations that would have 8-9 cars in front of me and I would still receive my food in a timely matter. There's only 3-4 cars I front of me and it's taken them 15 mins to service me."}
{"text":"Guest No 4522, 8:06, Jan@20 ordered are 3 DB L DB 2 W Raw GOP O Inst ! animal style 2 FF  Car in front of us apparently changed order when they paid. Are food sat there getting cold while they prepared new food for them. Why woudnt the employee have them move up until their food was done and give us are food sitting there ????Yup cold food, extra sliced onions on burgers and half full fries in each container....Had to MICROWAVE burgers and fries to warm up. Been coming to IN N Out for 30 some years and this food was no good"}
{"text":"In-n-out is always the best with extremely friendly staff and great food. This specific store fell short on timeliness and quality. The drive through was EXTREMELY slow. We ordered an additional cheeseburger inside and it took much longer than normal. \"Normal\" is based off the usual Las Vegas In-n-out which has a line almost to the door and every table full. Normally they crank out tasty food in a reasonable amount of time. Additionally, the buns seem to be dry and fall apart. This is the second time we've seen this at Las Vegas area restaurants. Between the dry buns and the chili shortage at the restaurants in recent times; I'm led to believe it's a cooperate problem and not a individual restaurant problem. As usual, the staff was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"This locations always seems to be busy, and seems to be hard to find a place to sit most of the time.  But, the burgers always taste good and that is the most important part"}
{"text":"The best fast food hamburger bar-none.  Several low Carb options on the secret menu too."}
{"text":"super bomb .  only con is it takes a little longer than most fast food, but thats the price u pay for a delicious burger"}
{"text":"I normally don't do burgers, but me and my husband is not from the west..so we finally got to try...and OMG delicious! And the line it's always very long!!!!"}
{"text":"I love In N Out Burger!  When I went yesterday I think it may have been a bit of an off day for them.  Customer service was great, staff was very friendly but the fries were a bit on the stale side as well as the hamburger buns.  Also, they had the AC running and I think it might have been only in the 70s outside.  Having the AC running doesn't help with keeping the food hot on your table.  Other than that everything was great."}
{"text":"This fast food spot always delivers. They are very consistent and out of the many times I've been here my order always comes out just the way I asked. Also.. Animal style EVERYTHING."}
{"text":"The best burger in town with the best customer service. The only downside was the fries. Even though they were fresh but, they were over crispy and hard to chew on. Overall, the number one fresh burger I've tried!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why ppl are obsessed about it. I literally tossed the cheeseburger after a bite. The fries were even worst. Disappointed!!!! The only thing i had was coke then went to jack in the box which was good."}
{"text":"The Best Hamburger joint on the west coast!!! Just tried the double double animal style today and a cheeseburger protein style. Loved booth of them, although they are at completely different. My all time favourite has to be the protein style. The only complaint I have is why they are only on the west coast. Why can't we have them all over the USA?? In fact I would love to open it up in the UK!!!!!"}
{"text":"How could you not love to eat here.. Freshly cooked when you order. No confusing menu, none of that gibberish menu here, just your simple burger, fry, shake and a drink and num num num.  :)"}
{"text":"In Hawai'i, we have our share of great burger joints, so when tourist tell me that In-N-Out is the best burger, I had to take the opportunity to try it as soon as I got to Vegas.  Don't get me wrong, its okay, but I was expecting Greatness due to all the hype this place always get. I got \"Animal Style.\" Which is just some chopped grilled onions mixed with some 1,000 island sort of sauce. We ordered four meals including shakes and our bill came out just over $20. So if I were to judge based on price alone, it would be a 5star, because you can't find $5 meals to fill you in much places.   But still, everyone gotta try this place at least once."}
{"text":"Okay first off, their fries still suck, and I'm never going to be a fan of these.  Secondly, I only ever order the Cheeseburger from In-N-Out.  The cheeseburger is priced at $2.50 and it's amazing. For the money you get a bountiful amount of food that is delicious at any time of the day and priced to perfection. Can't go wrong with their cheeseburger. Would recommend.  But seriously, anyone who likes the fries is on something, some kind of drug or hype train, because they are some nasty tasting fries. Let's also be honest here, In-N-Out's burger is nothing special, it's a generic cheeseburger that does it right for the price, it's certainly not the world's greatest or anything but it does earn the five stars for being priced right for the amount of food and quality of the cheeseburger."}
{"text":"Yes, it lives up to the hype....Animal Style no onions is where it's at people. They need to open up one of these closer to central phoenix.  It's either this location or the one on Rural in Tempe (EDIT: They finally opened one on Camelback & 20th st!)  High Schoolers working here are usually friendly (maybe since they actually make a decent wage).  I want to see someone order a flying dutchman animal style for the lulz and messiness.  Traffic around this location feels a little worse though than the Chandler & Tempe locations."}
{"text":"I'm always down for some In-N-Out burger. This place is always on point! I even order extra burger for my cat.... or at least that's what I tell people. Friendly service with a smile. Love it!"}
{"text":"This one wasn't as good as San Diego but it'll do! Good food for a good price! I love it! Can't get this in North Dakota suckas! Lol"}
{"text":"I love in-n-out but this is hands down the worst location I have been too. I have never been through the drive thru in under 30 minutes. It is the slowest drive thru it defeats the purpose. I will crave in-n-out; however will never go to this location because I always leave upset by how long it takes."}
{"text":"Yummy everytime i visit! Best burgers ever! So glad they have location so close to home! Excellent staff"}
{"text":"Had to eat here just because.  Ordered as Single Burger Meal.  Burger was good.  Didn't care for the Fries not really crispy with a fluffy interior as you would get with the double fry technique.  For the price a good value.  Establishment itself was clean.  Don't think I'll go here again.  If I do I'll do the \"off the menu choice\" Animal style.  At the most i would go with a double but that's just stretching it.  Meat ratio get too much from me in my opinion.  Need the right proportion of meat and other stuff."}
{"text":"Great hamburgers, try it animal style if you don't like raw onions. Service is always prompt and courteous. Fries aren't the best, like eating cardboard. Very clean."}
{"text":"I am a super big fan, but this location has sacrificed volume for quality.  The Fry's were cold and greasy, no salt at all and no salt in the bag.  I have never encountered that.  I ate about 10 Fry's and dumped the rest. Both burgers had thick stale bread that overwhemed the beef and fell apart, and just was not up to the In & Out standard.  Lastly the grilled onions were not grilled enough to take the crunch out of them.   None of this I expect from this company. This location has a company store and warehouse on site so I would expect the standard to be at it's Highest level.   Still, the place was hopping and all those poor unsuspecting soles from Kansas and beyond were happy knowing they finally got to go.  Too bad this location did not represent the brand better."}
{"text":"Of course the food is awesome, so I'm going to just comment on the atmosphere. I love listening to people placing their orders...animal style, special - special whatever. Also, the employees appear happy to be here and have genuine conversations with new and returning \"guests\". I don't come here very often, but when I do, it is always a very good experience."}
{"text":"I don't understand why people rave about this place.  The burgers are so so.  The burgers and fries here taste more of salt than anything else. My gf loves this place but I can't understand why.  I'll eat a whopper any day over this."}
{"text":"I may be biased since I'm a West Coast person, but I've had many burgers, and this is still at the top of the list for me, especially for fast food. Fresh ingredients, quick service, and friendly staff. Plus, their menu never changes, you know what to expect, deliciousness."}
{"text":"What can I say that isn't already known? Great burgers and fries! Menu is simple, it's only items that they do better than anyone. Try items from their \"secret\" menu!"}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out. I really do. And I always get a cheeseburger protein style. The last several times I've been to this location, however, the kids can't seem to get it right. I get it. It's not a normal burger. You're wrapping it in lettuce versus slapping it on a bun. But I beg you, I implore you, please try your damnedest to actually WRAP the burger in lettuce. Fold it around said meat and extras. It can be done. I've experienced this, I swear. And for Pete's sake, dry the damn lettuce before assembling. An extra second or two is all it takes. You don't want me looking like a total slob, do you???"}
{"text":"Came to Las Vegas from the east coast, was excited to try good burger as I've heard all the rave....the restaurant was great and fast..just don't get all the hype about these burgers."}
{"text":"Love the employees attitudes serving fast food burgers. Simple menu, and learning the secret menu. Always get my cheeseburgers \"animal style\" with hot peppers. Amazing and fresh."}
{"text":"Each and every time this store in particular gets my order wrong.   Nothing complicated, just cheeseburger, animal style (grilled onions should be included), add raw onion.   Grilled onions are always missing, burger patty is usually overcooked.   It feels like they are pre cooking beef in anticipation of orders, make sure you check before you leave.   This is one of those rare in n outs where clearly no one cares about their customers. No enthusiasm or pride in employees' work.   There are multiple reviews addressing the same issue, wrong orders, apathetic service.   I would love for headquarters to address my review and this store's incompetence in performing simple order prep and good customer service.   Check your order before you leave!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had heard so many celebrities on TV. say how they can't live without In-N-Out Burger,so,My family said let's go.We know understand what they meant by \"can't live without\".This is without a doubt a great burger place! If you go online and look up their menu you'll find items that aren't on the menu in the restaurant.The staff knows the items and are more than happy to make them for you.The staff is incredible!They are nice,efficient, and friendly.The restaurant is usually so busy,but it's worth the wait! The food is always fresh,hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"I have waited so many years to finally try In-N-Out and it was like heaven. Everything was so fresh and flavorful and outshines any other fast food places in the country. Be sure to look up other menu options online since they only have the simplest things listed on the board. Animal style fries are amazing!"}
{"text":"Always great eats for cheap. Animal style with fries well done! The buns were not a crispy as the ones in Cali.... Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful fast food place.  Extremely courteous staff, which is so rare at a fast food restaurant.  The place appeared to be very clean as well.  I am very impressed with the employees."}
{"text":"Classic quality I'd expect from In n Out. The atmosphere is simple and embodies that of a traditional, efficiently-run American fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Burgers are cooked to order. What makes the burgers special is the special sauce they add to it. The burger is a cross between a Big Mac and a Five guys burger. The awesome thing about this place is that it is DIRT CHEAP! A double burger and fry will run you about $5.30. Frys are ok, either you like them or you don't."}
{"text":"Oh In-N-Out, how i love you. I'm not a big fast food person, but if I'm going to indulge in a little this is where I go. It's one of those places where I can completely pig out and not feel like death afterwards. My usual is the Double-Double with fries. And I'll eat every last bite in a matter of a couple minutes, it's that good. Sometimes I add on one of their awesome chocolate shakes. I've never been disappointed with an In-N-Out burger & fries -- it always tastes fresh and seems like a fast food option that's not as bad for you. (Is that possible? Maybe that's just what I tell myself)  Also, this location has been pretty busy every time I've been there, so prepare to wait. But don't worry, it's worth it! Last time the drive thru was probably a dozen cars deep. Just goes to show how great the place is."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, cleanliness is perfect but service could be faster!! Love the animal style everything!!"}
{"text":"Most of American like their burger.. So I Go there and try ...   For Chinese is okay to eat. I heard American friend said it is a very healthy fast food in unite states. So I tried several times, the burger I cannot find what's the different with other places, but the chocolate shakes is my favorite one in there. The portion are very big as well."}
{"text":"So it was my first time going to an In-N-Out joint and I wanted to see what the hype was all about. The place packed up quick. There were about 6 people in line when we got in and the line wrapped around the store by the time we got our food. There has to be some reason behind this, right? Time to find out..  I never discussed this place with anyone, but for some reason \"double double animal style\" was implanted in my head from somewhere.. o_0 so I ordered whatever it was, along with a side of fries.   The burger consisted of cheese, grilled onions, pickles, tartar sauce(? or some type of sauce), and two patties. Them patties are thin! Man, the pics on the menu are deceiving. They make the burger look so juicy, succulent, and filling! The fries I could've done without. They were bland and the texture reminded me of styrofoam, of which my sister confirmed.    All in all, the burger was alright.. nothing spectacular. Personally, I'd prefer Five Guys or Smashburger over this. Hmm, service was decent and efficient, so our orders weren't screwed up which is a plus (yay!)."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Not at all gluten-free friendly! Boyfriend and I had a craving for burgers. Decided that we really didn't want protein style (bun-less) but since we have GF buns surely In-N-Out would be accommodating. Nope! Major disappointment especially since the In-N-Out in Henderson has been accommodating to this same request. Blue Diamond branch, while closer to home, definitely gets 2 THUMBS DOWN!!! Horrible customer service and we will not be dining here again (then again, we didn't this time either) we really wanted burgers but were not obliged."}
{"text":"Okay guys, yesterday I went to Carl's Junior ordered a superstar hamburger (see my review) and got super sick thereafter.  So today just a bit more up the street from Carl's Jr., I went to In and Out Burgers, like day and night.  Burger super fresh!  Everything presented as ordered.  Two beef patties (hot) crispy lettuce, steak size tomato, fresh yellow onion slice and spread, bun, oh my, freshly made too!  Further away from my house but order still nice and hot walking in my door."}
{"text":"After hearing so much hype from friends when they visit the US, I finally had the chance to experience this chain for myself.  Well I can say now I know what the hype is about.  The burgers are good....very good.  I think it all has to do with very fresh ingredients.  Nothing about the burger technically is that different from other chains but the quality of the ingredients and the simple menu is what elevates it above other places.  I like how the bun is not a cheap tasteless dry pre-packaged product but works well to round out the burger.  I did however find that the fries were only good.  Nothing spectacular about them but not disgusting either, good simple fresh fries.  The milkshake was very good however and when I go back, I'll probably get a 3x3 and no fries :)"}
{"text":"Terrible service last evening around 5:30 pm. Burger orders were all wrong! I don't know where to start on this one, so many screw ups. I ordered five burgers with various combinations of tomatoes/onions/no onions etc. etc. all of which were incorrect.  When I got to the pick up window, I was handed a box full of open, uncovered burgers. And then another box, full of fries. Again uncovered. I asked the server if they did not have a bag or something to cover the food with so that it did not spill or get cold on the way home. She looked at me like I was bonkers and said \"this is the way we do it.\" Not being a regular customer of this establishment I took the food and left. When I got back to my friends' place, they confirmed that when you order for take-out, it should be wrapped up and not in the open tray, that they assumed this order was to be eaten in the car. Seriously, there was one of me, five burgers, four orders of fries, three drinks... Did they really think this was all going to be eaten in the car? My friends also asked if I brought home some kind of special sauce, which I was never offered so I'm not really sure what that is. I am obviously am not a regular at this type of burger joint. And given the service and quality of food I probably will never be."}
{"text":"Congrats on being the worst in n out ever. I got home to find my grilled cheese upside down and stuck to the bag, which has possession of 75% of the cheese, with a soggy hole in the bag and spread and grease all over my passenger seat. Yay."}
{"text":"There is a few things that come out of California, and In-N-Out Burgers is one of them.  I never had any bad burgers, fries, or drinks from this place.  If you did not know, there is \"secret\" menu items that you can find out from on their website.  The 3x3 or 4x4 burgers are such secrets if you are hungry.  Sometimes the wait in the drive through can be long, but you can always say your food is fresh.  If I was not going to my sister's for dinner tonight, that is probably where I would be heading."}
{"text":"I have been to two In-N-Out burgers in my life. One was in Prescott and the other is here, on South Signal Butte Road in Southeast Mesa. This location is great. I don't get to come here very often because this is 30 miles away from my dad's home in Scottsdale. Here's how my service at this In-N-Out Burger went.  I was at a Best Buy looking around for Christmas presents. I had just come from about 11 miles southeast from the SanTan Motorplex in Gilbert. After I looked at Best Buy, I was hungry for a snack. Me and my dad wanted to find a McDonald's somewhere but the closest was in the Walmart next door to Best Buy. My dad had persuaded me to try In-N-Out and I did. Here's what happened.  We enter the drive thru and I get a large vanilla milkshake and French fries. It's December 2014, a few days before Christmas. What more can you get from a fast food restaurant on a cold Sunday evening? The fries AND the shake were SUPER good. I've never been to an In-N-Out until that cold December Sunday, but I have had In-N-Out in March.   This place is good. I will go back to any In-N-Out Burger!"}
{"text":"If you want a burger, this is the best burger place in all of Arizona & really the only place I would eat fast food apart from subway.  I rarely come here, but in those rare instances that I do, it's a pretty heavenly sandwich.  This is more if I have a real munchies at 11PM or later.  Stay away from the greasy fries, they aren't so great.   I always get the double double, gold standard of awesome."}
{"text":"I mean it's in n out, the food is almost always great. I've been sitting in line on a Friday night when it's dead and we've been ignored at the window for 10 minutes by Kendra. I was able to write all of this before being acknowledged. They made a burger wrong and forgot the animal fries- I'm glad we checked before we pulled away. Not impressed this time guys. Acknowledge people that come to the window at least."}
{"text":"AAB, average at best... never understand the hype, better than McDonald's but not as good as many burger joints.  Good value though, won't spend more than $6-7"}
{"text":"Love this place. However, this particular place is ALWAYS crowded. The line does move but your lucky if you find a place to sit. You pretty much have to stake out other customers who are about to leave in order to find a seat"}
{"text":"Only commenting on the drive thru wait time. Really?   Even when there are only a few cars it takes forever."}
{"text":"Amazing double double burger meal.. Priced right, better deal than Mcdonald's! Decided to come here for lunch with co-workers here in Vegas. Have never been before, but the food was absolutely delicious and fresh. I would recommend this place to anyone who lives a juicy burger. Will definitely be back the next time in in town."}
{"text":"First - a little disclosure, living back east, you can imagine that the thought of an In-N-Out double-double can sometime be better than the reality. Not on this trip!! The burgers were just as fresh and just as good as I had remembered. This location was spotless clean and quick on the delivery. The parking lot can a little tricky getting into so on your first trip, pay attention."}
{"text":"In-N-Out consistently delivers the BEST burgers of all time. OF. ALL. TIME. They top all of the other fast food chains AND gourmet burger restaurants at the end of the day. Their burgers and fries are always hot and cooked to perfection. Their grilled cheese and animal fries are awesome too. They keep banana peppers out by the ketchup now. What more could I ask for? :') I have zero complaints. I only feel sorry for the other 45 states that aren't lucky enough to have this glorious chain grace them with their presence."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a 5-star burger joint because they are doing everything so well!! Kudos to the manager and crew at this In-N-Out Burger. The place was packed, but the staff was still extremely friendly and efficient. We were greeted with smiles and a hello as we walked in and our food came out fast. When our fries were cold and we asked for new ones, the staff was very receptive and apologetic and served us hot fries right away. The food was good In-N-Out style! Plus, in spite of the crazy crowds, the floors and tables were impressively clean. If I lived in Vegas, I'd be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Love In N Out! Not to mention my girlfriend works at this location and tells me all the deets and I'm still eating here which says a lot! Their really clean and fresh! Nothing bad to say about this place!"}
{"text":"Nasty dry fries! And the patty was small. Lots of lettuce to make it appear bigger than it is. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Best burger joint to me I love this place the burger are the best I always get the 4x4 it's a huge delicious burger. I can't even finish the thing that how big it is I really love how your treated there with live and respect"}
{"text":"For when you have been far to healthy in your diet, there is In-N-Out!  So tasty their burgers and fries (must get them animal style with the cheez and sauce). Throw a shake in the mix (chocolate this time) and you are all set! And man do the employees hustle there!"}
{"text":"The in and out best there is!!! Love this place the food is amazing and always fresh. The aroma of the food is so addictive."}
{"text":"The employees here always have such great attitudes I would come here just for the service if the the burgers weren't so amazing"}
{"text":"This is all American food.  I'm calling it Ethnic, because American is an ethnic group too and they don't have a fast food grouping.  Hey!  I'm a California girl; we love our burgers the In & Out way.  Always fresh, always made to order and always made right.   Drive through or dine in.  The drive through is surprisingly fast.  The inside dining gets crowded at meal times but it usually works out that by the time your food is ready a table opens up.  On a nice day there are plenty of outside tables to take advantage of.  Kid friendly dining with lots of high chairs.  They keep it pretty clean even when it's busy.   Best fries on the planet because they are made ultra fresh right before your eyes.  Watch the guy take a  fresh potatoe and slice it and then fry it.  I like mine extra well done.  Not a problem at I&O.  They make it the way you want it.    Add on grilled onions with or without your slice of raw onion.  No prob. Full slices of onions (none of those dehydrated minced things that look like lice on your burger), rich ripe red tomatoes (not pink; red and ripe)and whole leaves of lettuce (none of that shredded stuff with brown edges).  The buns are baked fresh everyday too.  Fresh, fresh, fresh and juicy.  On a diet?  In and Out invented the protein burger over 40 years ago.  All the other fast food places are imitators.  In California we called it a Rabbit Burger.  All your burger goodies stacked on whole lettuce leaves and lovingly wrapped.  Messy and yummy.  Animal Style - it's not on the menu but you can make your burger or fries Animal Style - adds grilled onions and more condiments. On your fries it adds cheese, onions and thousand island sauce - Wow!  They (unfortunately) charge extra for it now.  Oh well, if you tell em to leave off the cheese they will not charge the extra $1.85 on to the fries though.  Top off your meal with a real made from ice cream shake.  Everyone else has finally followed suit on this one too.  Used to be you could only find ice milk being used.  I & O always used ice cream and still does.  Nice fat straws too - not those skinny ones that you have to suck your brains out to get a good slurp.  Pick up a cool t shirt and bumper sticker while you are there and show your burger love to the world!  Dang!  I've made myself hungry writting this reveiw.  Think I will head on over for some comfort food!   Sunday through Thursday 10:30 a.m.-1:00 a.m. Friday and Saturday 10:30 a.m.-1:30 a.m."}
{"text":"After eating at IN & OUT burger for several years I can say without a doubt that they deserve a 5 star rating! Great burgers and fresh fries. Always somebody cleaning the dining area, great service and I've never had my order messed up! They are PACKED just about all day long and I can see why."}
{"text":"I'd give this place no stars if possible. Fist of all the guys working we're to busy flirting with the customers and messed up our order. Second our burgers were soggy as if they had been sitting around for a while. This is the worst in n out I've ever been to. Avoid this location."}
{"text":"This place is just like any other in and out who does good staff is friendly Services quick the only thing that sucks about this place is that it's overrun by teenagers they're everywhere I swear they come out of the walls they're loud they're obnoxious."}
{"text":"Good burgers but how can a burger 1/4 \" high come out pink? I guess u need to ask for well done and if you want the beef get it double"}
{"text":"I have been to many of the In and Out Burgers in the valley, so this review isn't about this particular location.  Having been to so many I can't help but be impressed by the superior service received at every visit.  We are always greeted by a friendly cashier.  Service is quick, staff are fast to wipe tables and make sure the floors are clean.  If the drive-thru line is getting long then they send someone out to your car to take your order to help the process go a little more quickly.  And last, but not least, the food is always great!  Great burgers with fresh veggies that are always awesome!   I love In and Out and the fact that I can always count on a great experience!"}
{"text":"I love In-n-Out.  The service is always, always excellent.  Cheerful, prompt, courteous.  The employee training program is to be commended.  The simple menu means that you get your food quickly.  It is always fresh, always delicious.  I will always return!"}
{"text":"Always love in-n-out! Best burgers and fries on the west of the mississippi!"}
{"text":"I was a disappointed with the drive through. My order was totally messed up. My burger had no grilled onions or pickles. My box of animal style fries turned out to be two beef patties. The burger was really dry and did not taste like normal in and out. I like the franchise but this experience was bad."}
{"text":"My dream came true when I stepped into the clouds of smokey burgers and fries smoke goodness. Living on the East Coast I could only dream about eating here so finally got to taste it in Vegas!   Oooooh and it was as good as they say! I just had mine plain with cheese and regular fries. No need for animal fries or animal anything!   Cannot wait to have another in LA next month!"}
{"text":"Whenever I come to the West Coast, visiting In-N-Out is a MUST! I visited this location in Las Vegas located just outside the Strip. It was packed! In-N-Out does not have an extensive menu, but it does have some of the best in fast food!  I had a classic burger and fries - animal style! You have to ask for this as it is not listed on the menu - they top your burger and/or fries with chopped onions, special sauce and cheese - and oh man is it amazing! I substituted the drink for a classic vanilla shake to complete the order! It was creamy, smooth and refreshing after a long day of walking around Vegas!  This location had so many employees. They were friendly, helpful and fast with helping customers. The menu consists mainly of burgers and fries - I hear they also have a grilled cheese that is also part of the \"secret menu\" - next time I am out west, I will have to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Awesome, like every In n Out we've gone to.  Saving grace in the land of huge, all-you-can-eat, sysco buffets.  Fresh food, clean restaurant, clean bathrooms.  We love the consistancy of this chain.  (We get the double-double & grilled cheese, strawberry & chocolate shakes).  The fries aren't our favorite fries, but they are good, fresh cut (little too thin for our liking).  Service is good, smiles & good attitudes.  Might actually be a nice place to work, for fast food."}
{"text":"Fresh, cheap and fast.  Great customer service as well, especially for fast food."}
{"text":"The service here (and at the other locations as well) is excellent, and equally if not more importantly, the food is always outstanding at a completely reasonable price. Much better than competitors who in some case are more expensive for lesser quality food! Who doesnt love In-n-Out!?"}
{"text":"First time visiting the West Coast from NYC. And had my first In-N-Out Burger here. People really hyped it up too much for me and that's why I gave it only 3 stars. The first thing I noticed was the price of the burgers, I thought it would be more expensive since it's so popular.  I really like the fresh taste of the burgers but I don't like the meat. It's dry and not juicy enough for me. I like my burgers to be overflowing with juice within the first bite. I also didn't like the fries because it wasn't crispy enough. But I love the sauce for the Animal Style Fries.   I also gave this only 3 stars because I'm comparing it to Shake Shack. Shake Shack Burgers is my benchmark so far because of the thicker and juicier beef."}
{"text":"I don't understand the appeal of this place. Fries were bland, the patty on my burger was the size of a small McDonald's hamburger, and incredibly, for being so thin, it was bright pink in the middle! Do they use the grill just to heat it up? Because it certainly wasn't cooked. I'll stick with Five Guys."}
{"text":"Learn the secret menu!!! This place is great. We had one sorta bad experience here, we went through the drive through after a movie and when we got home and our order was wrong so we took it back and they replaced it without question, got home and it was wrong again! I took it back and again it was replaced but I decided to call the customer hotline because the manager was a little rude. They gave us 2 free meal certificates and added 4 more since we had to return twice! The lady was super apologetic and even called back a couple weeks later to make sure we got the certificates and apologized again. Honestly the experience wouldn't have stopped us from coming back because we had never had something like this happen before and aside from the manager the staff was super nice about the whole thing."}
{"text":"Have been to these guys in 4 states with every experience consistently good. The only gripe is it takes awhile to get your order - the price of cook to order food and a popular place. Definitely get the cool t-shirts that are dirt cheap. I am glad they don't have them in Washington because I would weigh 300 pounds."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed eating at the Sahara and Tropicana Avenues In&out locations everytime we visit LV (7X/2016; 2X/so far 2017). Glad to see young teens working the joint as they move rather quickly to get your food served. Who can complain about their freshly skinned and fries compared to other fast foods that use frozen fries and kept warm under a heating lamp. I normally get their #3 and am well satisfied."}
{"text":"Jack in the box is more tastier in my own opinion but still taste like a burger:)"}
{"text":"Started out the order was imputed wrong... got to pay window and ended up having to pay more and then find out I was overcharged.  2nd window had drink order wrong and was trying to hide making fun of customers.   Very bad experience Saturday night!"}
{"text":"Best location ever . Everyone else complaints because it's just a bad area and also because they are just whiners"}
{"text":"We usually love In N Out burger and get excited when we travel and get to eat it. Today we stopped at this location and ordered our food to go. Well...we just finished trying to enjoy our food but there were several things wrong with it.  1) We ordered two 4x4's but one of them was only a double.  2) 3 of our 4 burgers were undercooked!  3) We got extra spread packets from the guy who grabbed them from under the counter...no big deal except when we read the packages it clearly says KEEP REFRIGERATED! 4) Fries were old and cold! I hate cold fries!  We were very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Pretty fair to say that In N Out burger is always good. But, the reason I wanted to review this particular one was the exceptional service of the employees at this location. Every time i come to this location in particular I get my quickly, and the employees seem as though they genuinely care about you having a positive experience. Kudos!"}
{"text":"Cheeseburger and fries animal style, best thing on the secret menu.  Staff here is great, location is not so great but acceptable if you crave the food like we do."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Amazing service at the Drive Thru today! This is why I keep coming back! My advice: go eat here, NOW!"}
{"text":"Love it. I grew up in Southern Cali and ever since I was a kid I loved In-N-Out. We now have one in East Mesa off Baseline and Signal Butte.   =)"}
{"text":"Just moved from Indiana and wanted to find out what all this hub-ub was about with this burger joint called in-n-out. DIDN'T know what I was missing. Best burger that wasn't $30 that I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Great burgers. They use only fresh ingredients and everything comes put looking like the pictures on the wall (most burger places can't even come close to that). They have a limited menu: burgers, fries, sodas and shakes. All can be customized, even in secret ways. And that works for me, I prefer that they have chosen to be great at the things they do (and forget the other stuff)."}

{"text":"After a long shift, its great to receive some good service. A young man named Jent was exceptionally attentive to other guests and myself, and I will surely make the trip to this location, though its not my neighborhood in n out, if it guatentees this kind of service and just a positive experience. Theres nothing like having a complicated order, and recieving no complaints. Thank you jent and the team."}
{"text":"When I went to In-N-Out Burger I was expecting an okay burger no better than McDonalds. Boy, was I WRONG! the burger was great and all the ingredients were covering the burger. The service was what really made my experience great, though. They got everything correct and read back my order to be sure it was right. The wait was no longer than two minutes and everting tasted awesome. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What do you know about the off-menu animal style burger and fries??? Like grilled onions on your burger, along with grilled onions, cheese, and thousand island on the fries? Think the fries are too plain? Well, just say you want the combo \"animal style\" and you just might thank me for changing your outlook on In-n-Out Burger. Your welcome...."}
{"text":"I love in n out. But man this location is always so busy!! Expect to spend a good amount of time waiting. But if you want a delicious burger, it's worth the wait.  The workers are always so nice and focused on doing a good job."}
{"text":"In-n-out completely lived up to all the hype. I had a double, which is a pretty decently sized AND ONLY $4?!?? Unbelievable value. I am going to be so sad when I go back to East Coast without it.  I also got animal fries, which were pretty good."}
{"text":"Once I learned how to order from In-N-Out, (I'm lucky my gf is a cali native) I truly started loving this place! Fresh food and fast friendly service. The quality is really impressive. Not a huge fan of the fries even tho they are super fresh. I order them animal style with extra grilled onions and they taste much better. I like my burger the same way actually and it's so fire every time!"}
{"text":"I really can't understand what all the fuss is with In-N-Out burgers. I lived in So Cal for many years and have eaten everything on there menu both secret and regular. In a town with so many really great burger places In-N-Out doesn't even make the top 50. I have heard so many people saying how good the burgers, fries, and shakes are, but I just don't see it."}
{"text":"Even though it was 1 AM, the place was packed, but the cashiers kept the line moving and there was no loss in quality with the food."}
{"text":"First time I've ever had a sassy person taking my order at the register...yikes. Wish I had the friendly girl next to her. Attitude adjustment"}
{"text":"Drove 15 minutes to this location from my house to satisfy my pregnancy cravings. I specifically asked for all my order to have NO ONIONS (allergic). Came home, found onions on my fries. I couldn't drive 15 minutes back for them to fix their mistake. They just rush through my order without making sure it's correct. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"I grew up in the LA area, so In-N-Out has always been one of my favorite cheap burger places.  This NW location opened on 2/7/07.  I usually get  grilled onions, extra lettuce and tomatoes on my #2 or grilled cheese, and ask for my fries to be well done.  Yummy!  I can never finish more than a double double, so I don't usually order any of the 4x4s or any other \"secret\" menu items, but I know a guy who ate a 5-4-3-2-1, all in one sitting!  It must be a company policy to only hire happy people, because everyone who works at every In-N-Out I've been to has been super friendly!  Now if only they would open a location in the North...hint hint"}
{"text":"I don't normally eat fast food but this chain restaurant i give it 5 stars. The store was very clean and they had great customer service. It's mostly teens working their and they had a great attitude. I will definently go back to this in n out."}
{"text":"It's a company policy that you can order your burgers still medium-rare (or even rare) at any In-N-Out location, but despite being paid more than minimum wage at this location, they refuse to put in more than minimum effort and lie that they only cook their burgers to one temperature (which also isn't true, as I've received random temperature burgers here when not specifying any specific doneness). Lazy employees who are creating bad examples of what should be relatively higher-tier fast-food burgers.  If you really want In-N-Out, go to another location. Unlike basically every other restaurant, the people here just don't give a damn."}
{"text":"I wish I could give In and Out TEN stars, because I would.  We suffer from a great travesty in the Midwest by not having any.  Just FOUR WORDS:   Number Two - Animal Style  In and Out=HEAVEN"}
{"text":"I like that you can see the kitchen from the drive through windows.  This place is always clean and the service is excellent!  The burgers are made to order and fresh!  I just discovered that you can add pickles to your burger.  Didn't realize this before and have been going to In-N-Out for years.  I'll be visiting even more often because for me, pickles are a must for my burgers."}
{"text":"This was a must on our last day in Las Vegas being from the east coast.  The restaurant was pretty crowded during lunch time, but the staff was excellent. I've heard so many people talk about this place, but the burger and fries were okay. They feature a very simple menu, so not much to choose from. I doubt I will go again when I return to the west coast, but 4 stars for scratching it off my bucket list of restaurants."}
{"text":"Most the time its pretty good but this last time I had to ditch the burger as the guy at the grill was sweating profusely. I could see him dripping from the drive-thru. F'N Gross !"}
{"text":"This location is always busy, but it is worth the wait.  The burgers are amazing (we all already know this), and the staff are always friendly, welcoming and work very hard. They also are able to manage a long line in the drive thru very efficiently, you'll be surprised how quickly you can move through."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is one of the best fast food places around.  The menu us very basic but if you go online and look up the \"secret\" menu you will find a few different options.  I personally always go with a double double with extra sauce packets, fries extra crispy animal style"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.com only thing that sucks is the longish wait but that's because they make everything to order people!"}
{"text":"I come to this location a lot and they are very consistent. Food is always great and the service is always friendly. Even if I pull up 10 minutes before closing:)"}
{"text":"Being from east coast i had never eaten at in and out. Someone told me it was the best fast food ever! I don't see it. No variety nothing on menu except burgers fries sodas and milk shakes. The burger was good the fries were standard fries and the shake was not good very foamy."}
{"text":"came all the way for this. and I should order 10 to go and bring it back to Seattle. Very good fries! love the cheese burger !"}
{"text":"Pretty good burger ...mine was hot and fresh and the driver through person was even nice.....good eats for real cheap!"}
{"text":"Great clean location with fast service despite the large volume of visitors. I typically get the double double animal style with the fries extra crispy and yellow peppers on the side. In n out is my go to hamburger spot by UNLV. Top notch burger and fries. Overall impeccable service"}
{"text":"So I had gone to In-N-Out before but was not impressed because I though that their menu was limited. Only later did I find out that you don't order from the menu! You are supposed to order everything \"animal style!\" So lo and behold, when I was in Vegas this past Spring Break, I decided to try it. It was pretty good! I didn't really care for the animal style fries because they just put a square piece of American cheese over the fries which didn't really melt all that well, but the animal style burger was yum. The service was fast and the girl at the counter was really nice. She even walked over to check on me as I was eating. I would go back again~  P.S. Secret menu is online. :)"}
{"text":"Come on...a GREAT burger the others (5Gs, Smash, Shake, etc.) can't match and for less than half their prices!!!  This location, right off the strip, is packed at lunch.  You're going to wait at least 5 minutes on line and at least 10 for your order.  Didn't fault them for that because that's expected when you go there.  ANIMAL everything!!!  Fresh, friendly and clean.  And if you have kids, don't forget to ask for the hats and stickers."}
{"text":"Best bang for the buck with respect to burgers. Extremely consistent....also efficient and friendly service. As for crowds....that is consistent too....expect to wait at lunch and after school...but that just speaks of the food. Just an observation....but the LV In&Outs are better than the others on the West Coast."}
{"text":"Here is a common scene at my house:   I just worked a long day at my desk in front of my computer. I come home to read and relax and end up falling asleep until 10pm after all of the restaurants around us have already closed. I'm starving and exhausted and I don't want to cook. So what are my husband and I to do about dinner? In-N-Out seems to be the perfect solution. For under $12 we can get two grilled cheeses with grilled onions, two fries, and two extra large iced teas. And when they say extra large, they mean it. I got one of those for the first time last week because its only .40 cents more than the medium and good lord that thing was large. It took me two days to drink all of the tea in it. Occasionally when I am feeling extra unhealthy I will get a chocolate shake to dunk my crispy, hot, salty fries in. What? You think that's gross? Well, its not. You should try it sometime. Its amazing. I still have yet to try the animal style grilled cheese. I hear they exist.   We end up coming here probably once a week because its cheap and fast and I don't mind eating unhealthy once in awhile. I work out. So its all good."}
{"text":"We love In-N-Out Burger but we'd never eaten under the giant Vegas Neon sign location off the Strip. It was a nice hot night to sit outside and eat the one of the best cheeseburgers in the world!  It was fun watching people show up in taxi's!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Animal style burger add pickle, animal style fries with yellow peppers. Delish! My fave ultimate craving when I feel the need to break my diet."}
{"text":"Super thin Patty I have eaten at in n out in California for years and love it. This is by far the worst burger I have ever had. The patty was so thin on the single cheeseburger that I could not taste the meat with all the bun and fixings. What a disappointment. Not sure if this is only in Vegas. I have never had this happen anywhere else."}
{"text":"Having recently moved back to Arizona, I had to get some In and Out. It was exactly as I remember. Always delicious food and I have never had any problems with the service. Everyone is friendly even when the place is packed.  I definitely suggest finding some hidden menu items to try. Animal fries are definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"One of my favorite in n outs and I may have visited about 100 different locations in 4 different states. Even though it's Vegas it doesn't feel like Vegas, it feels like in n out! No matter how busy they are I've never had a bad burger or crappy experience. The crew is always ready to handle whatever comes their way! Thanks in n out!"}
{"text":"5 stars. Nothing else needed. If you haven't eaten In-N-Out yet and you are currently in AZ... if you're not a vegetarian.... are you from Mars?  Get in here and order a #3 right now."}
{"text":"F*ck Shake Shack and their over priced east coast crap burger.   You can never go wrong with a double double meal. love the burger, love the fries and all for a cheap price :D  the lines are always long but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I should probably start by saying.. I am pregnant and had been looking forward to this CHEESE burger all day. I ordered ONE CHEESE burger WITH onion... And a French fry. Lady asked if I will be eating in the car, I said No.. She says \"okay we will bag that for you.\" Great. I get to the window... Lady tries handing me a box of food. I said no... I need that bagged.. She acted put off By it. I get home.. Still excited.. Open my burger... It's a patty, bread and lettuce..... Clearly not what I ordered. Receipt CLEARLY says what I ordered. I'll keep driving a little further to bell rd. I attached a picture for a visual. Ha. Not happy"}
{"text":"I love In N Out but this location is awful ! My food was cold once I received it , I waited at the window for over 20 minutes and all I ordered was a burger . Seriously slacking"}
{"text":"ANlässlich eines Vegas Besuches (Arbeit) trafen ein Freund und ich eine Bekannte, die von Berlin nach L.A. ausgewandert war und nun einen Tag nach Vegas zu Besuch kam. Nach dem obligaten Shoppen war uns nach einer guten, amerikanischen Mahlzeit. Sie fragte uns, ob wir In-n-out Burger kennen würden. Wir verneinten und meinten, Burger Läden gäbe es doch genug. Wir haben später verstanden warum wir da extra hingefahren sind: Es ist eine kleine Fast Food Kette die nur in Kalifornien, Nevada, Utah und Arizona auftritt. Alles in privater Hand, kein Franchising. Es gibt eigentlich nur Cheeseburger und Hamburger - auch als Doppeldecker, dazu Pommes und ein kleine Auswahl an Shakes und Softdrinks. Das war's. Allerdings wird alles frisch gemacht: die Fritten werden aus Kartoffeln vor Ort geschnitten, der Salat vor Ort portioniert, das Fleisch vor Ort aus frischem (nicht gefrorenem) Fleisch durchgedreht usw. Jeder Burger wird frisch gemacht. Und wenn man drei Scheiben Gurke aber keine Tomate und drei Tropefen von einer speziellen Soße haben möchte machen sie das auch. Und wenn man keine Brötchen mag, dann packen sie den Burger in Eisbergsalat Blätter ein und nennen es Animal Style - Burger. Die Variationen sind schier unmöglich. Nach kurzer Wartezeit wird dann die Kassenzettel Nummer aufgerufen und das köstliche Fast Food kann am Counter abheolt werden. Selbst hartnäckige Fast Food Verweigerer werden hier weich - es schmeckt einfach göttlich amerikanisch burgermässig. Probiert es aus! Preise normal - Bedienung hart aber herzlich, dafür schnell."}
{"text":"In and out burger for the win. This branch was slammed with customers and was cranking out food like mad.  Mine was customized and came up perfect, and faster than a couple other branches I've been to lately.  Clean. Friendly. Great burger."}
{"text":"Growing up in So. Cal, In-n-Out has always been THE burger place to hit up ---on a long road trip, after a game, when you just get that urge.  It has a simple menu from the early days of hamburger joints ( burgers, fries , n shakes) that hasn't changed through the years.  It works.   Unlike most fast food places, the food here is ALWAYS fresh and made just for you.  I actually dont eat fast food too often anymore but when I do, its here. Yummy burgers, (mine is cheeseburger, no tomatoes, grilled onion, lettuce), fresh crunchy fries, and root beer.  I also make sure I introduce any out of town friends to the wonder of In-n-Out. Always beats their local \"gotta try\"  like white castle  YUCK.   The staff is always friendly and professional, which is great considering how busy they always are.  And just for fun, ask for stickers.  BUT = for this location, be aware it is always crazy busy. Opened few years back, and with the proximity to the Strip, anybody from anywhere who has heard of In-n-Out and makes it to Vegas hits this site."}
{"text":"This place clearly knows what they're doing, and they continue to do it long after opening their doors. While other fast food joints water down their menu with a jack-of-all-trades approach, In-N-Out sticks with a small menu of items they've perfected. The only thing I've seen them add is coffee, a Kona blend that's very similar to what's offered at Jack in the Box. That's where similarities end. When the economy slides down another notch, their prices only go up by a couple pennies. McDonalds and Taco Bell hold no qualms about jacking up stuff 35-65% whenever they feel like people aren't paying enough for the egg on their McMuffin or the Fritos in their burritos. And In-N-Out doesn't water down their drinks. If anything, they intensify the syrup and blast it with extra carbon dioxide so that the bubbles furiously retain their presence. And the water tastes clean, an amazing feat in fast food around here.  All items are fresh and trucked in regularly. I don't even think they have a freezer, because nothing is frozen. The meat is always cooked medium-well, with the slightest sliver of pink remaining in the middle, just enough to retain extra flavor while still being completely hot. Vegetables are ice cold, which can be potentially problematic if your burger sits for a long time without being eaten. Best to attack that thing as soon as you get it, because nothing compares to the bliss of a freshly prepared burger at this place. And never does it sit under a heat lamp. As soon as it's done, it's in your hand.  A standard Double Double contains two 1/8 lb patties. This is typically enough, despite a culture that expects our burgers to weigh as much as a human brain. Considering this is more meat (and better meat) than a Big Mac, I don't see the problem. But if you really want more, they do this weird thing there where they put as many patties as you want. Considering the burgers are fully customizable, from the number of patties, cheese, toppings and even the inclusion/removal of the bun, it's hard to see where you can find fault with the burgers. Short of ordering it animal style, they don't even charge for extra toppings.  And speaking of animal style, there is no greater sin than animal style fries. Whenever I feel like throwing caution to the wind and indulging my inner fat kid, that small hill of cheese, sauce and fried onions is enough to bring a tear to my eye. A full meal at this place always leaves me satisfied and jovial. And while I enjoy hitting the other places every so often, never does it compare to the immaculate In-N-Out."}
{"text":"Went out to eat for the first time today since our daughter was diagnosed with Celiac Disease.  As this was our 1st trip out I was super nervous of how well our concerns would be handled.  A very nice young man named Hector listened as I explained her allergy and right away he made sure she was properly cared for.  He also made sure our table was cleaned to prevent any cross contamination.  We left there feeling at ease and will definitely return.  Thank you Hector for helping make our 1st dining out experience a great one."}
{"text":"After going years since having my last Double Double one of my most anticipated visits on the itinerary was the nearest Inn-N-Out.  After the suspicious taxi ride loop around the highway to get to the restaurant I finally arrived and ordered after waiting shortly in  line.  What nostalgia I had built up in my head since my last burger led to disappointment.  It may be this particular location because the ones in California I remember tasting much fresher and better.  I am willing to give a different location another shot but in this day there are so many similar fresh and fast competitors."}
{"text":"This restaurant, is no ordinary restaurant. This is a divine shrine, a place of worship, sent from the heavens above, to reward mankind for his devotion to burgercraft.       You see, I am a burger connoisseur. I travel continents upon continents, searching for what is the ultimate flower of the art of burgercraft. I had at first placed a rare delicate burger made of the scraps of filet mignon, prepared by the Cancun Ritz Carleton's finest chef at the head. It had a flavor rating of over 4000 ghlis, the primary unit for taste. It has replaced the 3000 ghlis burger my great grandfather had discovered in Nepal, prepared by a monk in his monastery. It was truly a spectacular burger.       However,  as I roamed the streets of Arizona, looking for a decent burger for lunch, I could not find one. The only place I could find to eat was a chain called \"In-N-Out\" What Archduke burgercraft-Connoisseur would be expected to eat at a food chain? Alas, I swallowed my pride and ordered what they called a \"double-double\" I was hesitant to see such lower class citizens such as golfers, and lawyers eating alongside an Archduke Burgercraft-Connoisseur such as myself. But, as I took a bite of this burger I lost track of thought. Time stopped, thoughts vanished. As the creamy, yet tangy sauce dribbled town my throat, I has achieved a state of Nirvana only highly trained Buddhists can achieve when meditating for years at a time. As the crisp, fresh bun was chewed, I knew I had found the next burger to take the crown. The elixir of immortality, the ambrosia of the gods, falls short in comparison to the spectacle of modern burgercraft. This burger is over ten hundred thousand ghlis. So I say to you, consume this Art while you can, for only God knows how long this art will last."}
{"text":"Always worth the wait! Great customer service I've been coming here for years and I've never once had my order wrong which is crazy since I'm very specific. I highly recommend coming here don't let the long line discourage you"}
{"text":"Always our first stop for grub when we hit the ground. You just can't beat the fresh greesy goodness of in-n-out."}
{"text":"I enjoy how simple the burgers are even the animal style ones. The prices are reasonable since they can certainly make them more expensive and I think people would still buy them regardless. As far as busy they are, don't let the line wrapped around the building scare you- it moves quickly."}
{"text":"This place is one of the better burger places but not the best. Their burgers are good and filling. I'm not sure why the fries are so popular. I know they are fresh but I just don't care for them. Maybe they are too thin. Idk. Animal style makes them a bit better. But it's a nice little spot for a burger. I guesss I just prefer 5 Guys better."}
{"text":"By far and near as well, in'n'out has the best fast food burgers around. There burger sauce is especially goo on the fries and you can even ask for chili peppers! Not a fan of animal style because I like fresh onions, but animal style fries are a meal in itself. Go crazy with those carbs, otherwise make mine a double-double!"}
{"text":"Great food!!   Another bonus:  it's usually less crowded at lunchtime than the other locations around town."}
{"text":"With out a doubt I will always love In n Out Burger.  Moving back west and being able to pick up a burger and fries from my favorite fast food restaurant will never grow old.  Five Guys has nothing on this classic Southern California burger joint.  Gotta love it..."}
{"text":"A new branch, this one with outdoor seating and umbrellas. Pitting the Best of the West vs. Best of the East, I ordered the standard two burger In-N-Outer plus a slice of onion, planning to do the same when I got back to the newly opened 5 Guys Burger on Long Island.  The In-N-Out burger overall was good, the lettuce and onion adding crispness, but the burgers themselves were thin, overcooked discs. However, the sauce was so addictive that my brother had to restrain me from going back and ordering another.  Sorry, West (see my review of the 5 Guys in Huntington Station, N.Y.), the East Coast burgers are plumper, juicer, tastier, and cooked medium, as a burger should be. One more star for the East."}
{"text":"Best burger chain hands down!! the minute I landed anywhere in Vegas or California, In-N-Out is always the first destination. I usually even bring some back to Seattle with me. It is that good!! The animal-style fries is bomb! pretty much everything they serve is worth getting."}
{"text":"There isn't a day that goes by that I don't drive by this place and have to physically steer straight. My vehicle seems to understand my adoration for this burger joint.   Let's get real people. This is fast food at its finest. I don't even recall my last step into somewhere other than In-N-Out when my girlies or my belly required food in a jiffy.   There isn't a thing about this burger that isn't perfection to me. Yes, of course my inner Foodie would prefer going all Gourmet. But not everyday. And sometimes fast and furious is just what we busy Mommas need.   From the soft yet crispy-in-all-the-right-places bun, to the super fresh greens onion and tomato to that darn sauce that will haunt you. I want to tuck it in my cheek for later. My daughters get it plain \"meat, cheese and bun\" style and even that earns a medal in my book.   I also love the fries. You can tell how fresh they are and even my everything-is-a-vehicle-for-ketchup daughter will eat these fries. That's a pretty big deal.   Go animal style (grilled with mustard, fried onions, extra sauce) for when you feel you deserve or require special treats. Go protein style when you want to lower your carb intake. But just go. GO NOW!"}
{"text":"The people who gave this below 4 stars must of accidentally walked into Mcdonalds.....  As a UNLV student this is just a 10 second walk from my classes, They food is hot and always fresh and the burgers are juicy with great sauce. I've been to some great burger places in NYC but still non have surpassed In-N-Out for me!"}
{"text":"One of the best things about living in the Southeast is In-N-Out.  Don't take it for granted as I did.  I know live in Washington and glut on In-N-Out every time I am near."}
{"text":"best fast food. open late till 1am and always cooked to order. I love their milkshakes!"}
{"text":"Mandatory stop, especially with a teenager. Shakes and fries are great so are the burgers. Throwback staff is very friendly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Short menu, fresh burger, stunning fries...what else can you need?  Sometimes the tables are bit dirty... Nothing very importante. The meal makes all worth."}
{"text":"This was the first stop off the plane after getting the rental car. I moved to the east coast over a year ago and had a craving like no other.  Double double animal style, fries, shakes.  **bliss out**"}
{"text":"Great location.  Restaurant is a little small, so it gets crowded at lunch.  Overall a clean and good place to eat."}
{"text":"Food is great, but they're really let the bathroom cleanliness be ignored at this location.  Graffiti in the bathrooms, not clean, and just an \"unkempt\" feeling come about you when visiting this location.  I'll still go here because I love In-n-Out, but someone needs to get this location cleaned up."}
{"text":"I really hate to say it.  We've been ordering out of the blue diamond location for the last couple of years.  And it's usually big orders.  My colleague order 25 burgers and 25 fries at that location. He requested no onions on all the burgers.  Because most of my colleagues are allergic to onions. And finding out later all burgers have onions.  I have my colleague call right after to customer care and notified what's wrong and the customer care specialist named (Destiny) tried within her power to accommodate the problem.  But the sad thing is that we had to throw the burgers away and not being reimbursed, it's really alright on our end. But the problem has been recurring and really need to be handled.  The only solution is to call customer care and place the order.   We really love the burgers from in n out and if you are planning to order a big catering, call customer care and ask for (Destiny).  She will take good care of you.  And please keep your receipts, since they don't keep any records."}
{"text":"Peu de choix de burgers, mais ils sont bons et les menus ne sont vraiment pas chers, en lus avec des boissons a volonté. Les frittes étaient juste un peu trop salées."}
{"text":"Customer service was ON POINT. It's refreshing to see such happy faces especially during the lunch rush. Went there yesterday around 12 and it was quick and a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am a fan of this Franchise and have eaten at many of their locations.  We parked and dined in (as opposed to using the drive through) and, even though it was a weekend and busy, the line moved quickly, the staff was friendly and we got our food in the amount of time I expected.  Burger & Fries were good and I felt I had good value for the money. Burger was juicy and not dry or overcooked which is always appreciated."}
{"text":"We always make this a stop on our Vegas trip.  Without fail, the food is great!  However this last time we were waiting at counter for our order (long lines as always) and just as our food ready to be called up for our number, a drive thru order person took one of our  fries.  We were left to wait for next batch of fries and the first fry in our order ended up cold.  We were quite surprised they'd do that with us standing there.  We mentioned that it was unfair but they merely looked surprised and said sorry.  Sorry we noticed I guess."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and fries, great price! Excellent service at this busy location. Cashier in drive thru heard our kids screaming and gave us stickers for them, thank you!"}
{"text":"I love their burgers, but their fries leave something to be desired. Guess it's just me. Parking also sucks here."}
{"text":"SLOW service. I've been to other In-N-Outs before, and while I'm not the biggest fan of their food, they at least get it out in a timely manner. This location doesn't seem to do the same."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've had In N Out, so yesterday I decided to stop by for lunch. I had been to the dentist earlier that morning & my teeth were still hurtin, so I decided to avoid any long drive thru lines & go after the lunch rush at about a quarter till 2pm. When I pulled up there was still a bit of a wait, about 6 or 7 cars were in front of me. I can only imagine how long that line gets at noon! Any way, I ordered a #2 animal style with a dr. pepper. Everything was so tasty & I finished it all! Total for a cheeseburger, medium drink & fries was less than 6 bucks, so awesome. Best fast food burger by far!  P.S. I love how pleasant the employees working at In N Out are, it's very refreshing :)"}
{"text":"Decent food for an amazing price. The customer service was good. My burger quickly became soggy which made me sad."}
{"text":"Always great. We enjoyed your burgers and shakes. Very kid friendly and everyone is always happy. Keep up the great work its always amazing. I love the double double. Its my favorite and the skinny fries are great!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and fries. Great customer service and quick! Love In and Out Burger!"}
{"text":"Finally.   They don't have In & Out burger (yet) in Michigan.  This was my first time.  This is one of places that you hear people rave about all the time when talk of the best burgers comes up.    Pros:  Price.  Service (5 star).  Fries, thin and crisp.  Good burger.  Cons:  No cons except it's not the best burger ever.  If I get another chance I'll have to order animal style.  4.5 Stars"}
{"text":"I got the lettuce rape, low Carb, double cheese.  It was outstanding.  Very good service.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"What to say about In-N-Out? The best hamburger hands down. Then again I am biased. I have been a long time fan since I can't remember. I used to live near the original In N Out. Every one I visit offers the best tasting, juicy burger along with the yummiest fries. There menu is simplistic and there customer service is top notch. I can honestly say that not a single order ever screwed up. You just can't go wrong by visiting In N out."}
{"text":"As an East Coaster I was excited to try In-N-Out Burger for the first time because everyone always raves about how great it is. I must say I was honestly a bit underwhelmed. The service was absolutely fantastic especially considering that I visited during the lunch rush when it was extremely crowded. I had a double-double meal and I was very underwhelmed with the burger, it just didn't seem to have a whole lot of flavor to it. I ordered it without the sauce or onions as I don't like them, so maybe people who like onions like the burgers a lot more? The fries were okay, but nothing to write home about. All in all, I was a bit disappointed that I've been wanting to try In-N-Out for years, when I can go right down the street from my house and get a better burger at Five Guys."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger places!  I love the animal style French fries and getting grilled onions on my burger."}
{"text":"In N Out Burger is hands down the best fast food place I've ever eaten at. The food actually tastes good, unlike most mass fast food chains. The burgers are to die for, as are the fries. I love how everything is made fresh daily and the fries are cut in the store. The one thing I don't like is how it seems everyone in Phoenix seemed to be at this location when I was there. I guess the fact that it was the day after Christmas and that it's near Paradise Valley Mall didn't help that. We couldn't find a table so we tried eating outside, but it was way too cold and windy (I was visiting from Cleveland, so I was shocked at the cold weather) so we ate in our car in the parking lot. It was worth it though. Hands down In N Out is one of the best burger places in America. Now they just need to come to the Great Lakes region."}
{"text":"I got a hard burnt bun with my cheeseburger. I definitely won't be back to this location ever again."}
{"text":"In-N-Out never disappoints. My usual order is an animal style cheeseburger with fries. Yum! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Their food is always amazing. Where else can you get a grilled cheese? They have yet to get my order wrong, and their attitude is always pleasant."}
{"text":"What can i say? In-n-out. Best fast food burger joint. Cheap and fresh."}
{"text":"This. Is. The. Best. Burger. Ever.  I'm in love. This was my second time in Vegas but the first time I actually made it to In-n-Out (First time I just saw it from my hotel room window). The Double Double I had was orgastic; Fresh, hot, juicy and tasted damn good.  Even the fact that it took forever to get my burger doesn't deduct a star,  the wait was well worth it. Now I just wish they'd open a branch in DC but I know that's a pipe dream. Luckily we have Five Guys that's almost as good. Almost."}
{"text":"I MISS you In-N-Out!!!!!!!!!!!!!  So good! Best burger ever!  & they are open late  I love how their are only 3 choices. I love the double double animal style with grilled onions, & extra lettuce, extra cheese and extra sauce.... OMG :)  I'm sure it's not healthy, but if you don't go often... then why not !!!!  The meat, grilled onions, and toasted buns are done fresh right in front of you & their shakes are yummy too.   The animal style fries are a must have (but not on the menu... you have to have insider knowledge ;)   The protein burger is not on the menu either but it was ranked on of the best burger in the country by MSN if your watching your calories... ( it is basically everything wrapped inside crispy lettuce leaves.  It is really good too, you don't even miss the bun.   The franchise needs to expand to more states!"}
{"text":"Short: It's In and Out, and it's a good one. Haven't been to a bad one, but this one is good.  Long: It's VERY busy, but the service is decently fast for how busy they are. Food is on par with every other In and Out I've been to; no complains.  I recommend just a plain Hamburger as you get to taste the meat and veggies, and Animal fries since the regular ones are kind of bleh~"}
{"text":"I don't really know what all this hype is about. In N Out sucks their burgers aren't tasty,  their fries are some of the worst I've ever had. This place sucks..."}
{"text":"Double Double, animal-style with fries well-done.  I would smack your grandma for that meal."}
{"text":"In N Out Is by far the best burger joint out there! :) very simple menu but everything is great!....this place is crowded at times but the wait isnt that long...its clean, and the staff is very fast and friendly"}
{"text":"This was my first time at an In-n-Out Burger, and it was great.  Had a Double Double animal style.  It was fresh, and the sauce did not overwhelm the burger and other toppings. The restaurant was clean, and the employees were kind and helpful. I would definitely go back.  I hope the franchise expands to the midwest someday."}
{"text":"Over hyped. Look, the burgers are a bit better on a fast food scale. In a arena of McD and BK, hands down better. I live in TX and have better options. I like INO for there novelty, but it isn't the best in class.  It's good, eat there. If you want better, plenty of options."}
{"text":"Best fast food burger joint around. Always have great service and great food. You be filled up and happy.   Get the double double animal style for a little something extra. Also if you like crispy French fries order them well done and you won't go wrong.   Never had a bad experience at any location and love the franchise. Try it if you haven't."}
{"text":"very little of this applies to the location. the food and menu are a dang joke.  the food is wretched and so greasy that if you held your bag long enough the burger would fall through it from soaking the bag.  the menu listed in the restaurant was all of three or four burgers and a few sides.  in-n-out seems to think that having a hidden menu of some sort that you have to know in advance is some sort of fun thing.  well your clerks need to know this. our check out clerk completely fumbled the order giving my girlfirend a number one rather than the grilled mustard burger and he got her fries wrong too.  the only think he got right on my burger was no cheese.  i asked for mustard and ketchup and got none of either.  the meat tasted old as if it had been frozen for a long time and then thawed. you may think this was a unique experience but i ate at in-n-out once before at the far north scottsdale location when they first arrived in the valley and remembered thinking very much the same of the food. we had to clean off our own table as well. terrible experience.  i promise it wont happen again because i'll never eat at any location again. to bad there isn't a \"no star\" rating."}
{"text":"Hamburger animal style with peppers, best bang for your buck!  I like to fool myself into thinking that all the fixins are equal to a salad :) The lettuce, tomatoes were fresh and the peppers and pickles were crisp. This was a super tasty burger and unbelievably for $2.20! Amazing!  Fries well done were awesome as well.  In-N-Outs weakness is their drinks. The soda never has enough fizz and the shakes are too runny. So I always forgo getting drinks there.   While the lines may seem daunting, staff are super efficient and the line moves quickly. Definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"SO YUMMY. A great guilty pleasure in Vegas. Oh wait, what isn't there? I had just your basics - cheeseburger and fries, chocolate shake. Can't go wrong.  Good service and quick - lots of lines here but they get through them quick. I miss it and it's DEFINITELY on the list for going back (at least twice, three preferably) the next time I'm in Vegas or any other city that has them. Go eat!"}
{"text":"Best fast food. Double double animal style. yea buddy!"}
{"text":"The food at in n out burgers are all the same.... the only thing that i can rate is the service.  This location has the highest number of my orders messed up.  Whoever is in charge isnt doing a great job.  everytime i come here it seems it's a for sure messup.  From now on im going to avoid this in and out.  Sadly this one is very close to my house and i have to drive far away just to get a burger.  I'll probably go eat at other restaurants from now on."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where people will rave about and drive and/or fly to eat here, why?  It's a decent burger , I've eaten here about a dozen times. I would not wait in line for 10- 15 min to eat here.            This last time went with out of town guests, I had the 3 by 3 , 3 patties 3 pieces of cheese and fries.  It was alright not great. IMO a plain old burger nothing special.  Animal fries, cheese, grilled onions and thousand island dressing ( whoopee) I don't care for it.  I guess the big selling point of In n Out is the beef is never frozen , it don't really matter to me  , I can't really tell anyway, I mean unless it's freezer burned.  I don't know if Jack in the box, carls jr , mcdonalds, burger king or Wendys freezes their meat , they probably do, and their burgers taste just as good or in so cases better then In n Out . The fries are fresh cut , they have a different texture , not as crisp , or as good as mcdonalds, before U   scoff and write off my review , because I like mcdonalds fries... For the record I'm a Carl's jr's fan .              I gave it 3 stars because it's a decent burger and the price is right ."}
{"text":"Being from So Cal and looking for a place to eat at midnight, had to go with the old reliable burger joint. Place was packed, food was delicious and as consistent as we expected, and fries were great. Only complaint, tried to find a clean table. At least 10 tables were 'open\", but all of them had various degrees of food and debris on them. Once I asked the counter girl if she could get someone out to clean a few tables, they remedied the situation quickly. Overall, great experience."}
{"text":"Simply THE BEST. I adore In-N-Out burger. I'm actually getting hungry just writing this review. This location is very clean, quick, and the service is great. And they are open until 2am for your late nights out!   Always go for the animal style. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place is always a stop when i am out in AZ.  Loves it!!!!!!!!!! Great burger, great fries, not too expensive, usually pretty quick.  I only wish they had in-n-out where i live.   I like to stick  with the double double and fries.  My gf likes to get her fries well done.  Its a nice option if you like them extra crispy, but regular tastes fine to me."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger place of all time. The 4x4 burger rocks."}
{"text":"I am a foreign from Midwest. I am not a fan of burger or sandwich things. Plus I couldn't find in -and -out burger in my city. After hearing my American friend got excited about this  fast food. I was just curious and decided to give it a try. I definitely liked the cheese burger here since on my first bite. I liked how soft the bread is and fresh tomato. Here they served the good deal. It's not expensive at all. I saw the long line for drive through order and also people kept coming for dining in. I also noticed that staffs were very polite and nice.  That was impressive for the cheap fast food things. Cool! Please,  maintain this quality.  U r superb."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after a long night at the strip and a few hours of rest..service was quick and the dudes were friendly...the place was clean food was great..butt afterall it is in n out haha"}
{"text":"best place to hit before heading to the airport on the way home!  Double double, animal style with animal style fries and a shake.  A great meal after you've lost all your money and you need something to pick up your spirits before you make the long plane ride home.  How many times have I done this?  Too many!  During peak times, this has got to be one of the busiest In and Out's around.  It's rare to see it not crazy crowded so seating can be tough.  But if you go at the right time, not the normal lunch and dinner hours, you shouldn't have a problem.  If it's your first time, stop by the store and get a t-shirt for the memories!"}
{"text":"This place is really good and I love to hear something to everybody that I know that this year I pray to lord Jesus that everybody will be here because it is cheap"}
{"text":"My favorite fast food place!  Wish we had these in the east coast.  That would be grand."}
{"text":"I ordered a single cheeseburger w/onion & animal fries. I got a double double without onion & regular fries. This is after waiting over 11 mins (they have a timer that tells you how long a car had been waiting).  I told the girl I got my order wrong she didn't apologize, just told me I'd have to pay more & in a tone that made me feel like I'm the one in the wrong.  So over this location! Only reason it got two stars is because the taste was decent. Not enough to warrant another visit."}
{"text":"Ok ok I know this is not the most healthy place to eat but then again all fast food stops aren't really built for the health gurus.  However this in and out is great!   Those burgers are really good especially animal style version.  Gotta try that and also I love the fact they put out those little peppers which is perfect cause I love a little spice in my life.  Place is always clean and the people are always nice."}
{"text":"This is the worst In and out locations ; i went through such long period of waiting for a burger that is so/so, after taking the wrong order; letting me wait 45 min by the door ; and none apology for the inconvinience from the staff!!??? Lock this place up. !!! And the one star you got from me is the also the star that will going to fall in this location!!\"\"!#%"}
{"text":"Best employees at a fast food place hands down, but why In-N-Out has such a following is a mystery. The thing about the burgers is that the meat is great and the buns are nicely toasted, but then things take a turn for the worse.  Upon the nicely toasted bun they spread some sort of mayonnaise based goo they refer to as \"spread\".  Unless you stop them, they will pile up onions that reek to high heaven on top of the great meat.  Your car will smell like In-N-Out for a week if you get take-out.  After such a promising start, the end product is hardly recognizable as a traditional hamburger.  Then there are the fries.  Once again, and this is very encouraging, they start with fresh cut potatoes.  Unfortunately, the put these poor potatoes through some sort of top secret process that turns them into cardboard within 15 minutes after they go into your take-out bag.  Here's an In-N-Out dining tip.  Mercifully, In-N-Out will let you have your burger your way.  Go through the take-out, and just get a hamburger, or even a double hamburger, and the bun. Do not allow them to put anything on the burger.  The bun and the meat are the best parts of the In-N-Out burger.  Take it home and add the things you like.  If you like a good burger, you'll be very pleased.  As for the fries, here's a money saving tip.  Ask them if you can have the little cardboard tray they put the fries in.  Then when you get home, just eat the little tray.  You'll hardly notice the difference."}
{"text":"Its good but they said they couldn't make a 5x5. Hella weak! I would give it 4 starts but since they couldn't make my 5x5 they get a 3"}
{"text":"Ooooooh i didn't believe it the in-n-out n phoenix  i was n SF and i think they hve just in california area !!!! I wish all people try this restaurant it's so good  and halal .."}
{"text":"This is not my go to place for a good hamburger like some people.. but, I do like their hamburgers when you order it \"animal style\"  I think some local burger joints like Lenny's is better overall, but they are so darn expensive it is hard to justify their prices..  Overall, In N Out does the job and it is pretty close to my house so I continue to get fat there...  :-)"}
{"text":"Really not cool I never complain but the last few time my protein style come out like shit"}
{"text":"Got to give a shout out to the crew at In-N-Out Burger, best fast food in the business.  When I just need something quick and easy on the way home for dinner, nothing better than there burger and fries.  Good ole comfort food when I am feeling stressed from life.  Great dinner last night!  Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"MUST EAT HERE! GREAT alternative to any other Burger joint. Animal style adds onions and sauce... the Fries are amazing too!"}
{"text":"I'm from the north and we don't have In-N-Out burger. So, on a trip to Vegas, I wanted to see what all the hype was about. Honestly, I just don't get it. It was fine. Pretty much what you would expect based on the price. The worst part was that it was INSANELY busy. We had to hover around (along with about 30 other people) to wait for people to get out of their seats. They did keep it pretty clean and organized in there though, considering the masses of people they were serving, so that's impressive."}
{"text":"Employees are always nice, always fresh and tasty as usual.  I come every week to this location, love the food, always satisfied.   The only thing I am not so satisfied with is the wait time. There is always a wait line, at least 8 cars at any given time. Usually dies down at 12am lol.   Finally, decent location, awesome food, nice employees but needs work with wait times."}
{"text":"This afternoon I craved a burger. The Sinaloence had prepared menudo (red) it was tasty,  but my pallette desired to return to gringolandia.  I wanted a burger from the secret menu. A single 1x2 cheese burger,  mustard fried, extra toast, split in half with cheese fries. Simple,  no?  I got here at 2:10 pm. It was overwhelmed with business. There was no room to park,  the drive through lines were so long they had pylons strategically placed with boys in red polos with order pads running up down the line taking verbal orders. I was not deterred. I was going to have my cheese burger. Magically a parking spot opened 15 feet from the front door! Wow. \"This my lucky day.\" I thought.  The lobby was full,  but as my luck was running high and hot it turns out that all of them had ordered and a smiling counter girl immediately saw me through the crowd and waved me forward. Wow,  I was being taken care of immediately!  I began my order with the perky counter girl. \"I'll have a single 1x2 cheese burger,  mustard fried, extra toast, split in half with cheese fries. The perky one frowns and asks, \"1x2?\"  \"Oh no!\" I thought,  \"has my luck run out so quickly?\"  The counter girl is a newbie, but a second counter boy jumps in with an assist.  He obviously was secret menu conversant. In those few moments a line of seven customers had formed behind me. Another counter boy jumped forward on another register and they addressed the customers with smiles and good manners.  I,  with order in hand,  turn to find a seat in the already overpopulated dinning room and voilá a seat opened up instantly as if by request. \"Geez-louise,\"  I think,  \"I could really get into this luck thing.\"  The order did not take long to fulfill. I found myself munching down a single 1x2 cheese burger,  mustard fried, extra toast, split in half with cheese fries. The burger was excellent as usual, crispy,  full of flavor. The cheese fries fresh and crispy. My visit to gringolandia was successful.  . Service: outstanding 5 cleanliness: outstanding 5 Food: outstanding 5 Yeah! My very first 5!"}
{"text":"SIX STAR REVIEW: Everything you already love about in-n-out. Plus, one time my car broke down IN THE DRIVE THRU (facepalm, smh, embarrassing) and the employees didn't even HESITATE to come help me push it through (i mean it makes sense, they can't have a car blocking their drive-thru, that's bad for business was like 115 degrees that day and they ran out to help me!) So nice! Did you know they have a secret menu? Of course you did who cres have you seen their REGULAR MENU?? Actually i usually order a 4x4 or 5x5 cause I like to practice unhinging my jaw. Put fries on your burger. Eat it. Thank me later."}
{"text":"I love this place! Whenever I catch a movie here with my friends, this is the place we hang out afterwards. I love the crispness of the burgers and you can tell that everything is fresh. This is the greatest hang out spot to chill at."}
{"text":"Great food. Fast service. Reasonable prices. Very busy at lunch time. Very clean restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Im on a  Atkins diet I always love these guys they just killed a regular burger no cheese mustard instead of the spread it's awesome the ,,,,,, no wonder because they're owned by pretty particular  ppl( I like watch my food being prepared sometimes?? I wonder with some other fast food places!!! any way, they're really good"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst In N Out Burgers we have ever went to. The fries were cold and the bread was hard. The employee's were friendly and the place was clean."}
{"text":"Forgot items in my order...... usually okay food but was a simple order that was not completed correctly.... paid more money for less food"}
{"text":"This is probably our favorite place for fast fresh great tasting burgers. My daughter loves this place and it was the only place to have a surprise 16th birthday party for her. The staff was more then accommodating. They were great getting the food out to us fast. We go back all the time. It is always clean and friendly."}
{"text":"I grew up in SoCal and had access to In-N-Out pretty much whenever that craving hit. Then I lived in Colorado and New Mexico for 10 years. Ten long years of torture, unsatisfied cravings and crappy burgers. So it is without shame that I admit that a huge deciding factor in my move to Arizona was the presence of In-N-Out burger.  There's no dollar menu, only 3 combo meals and except for the price, the menu is essentially the same as it was 50 years ago. Yet In-N-Out is ingenious in its simplicity. You always know what to expect: fresh meat, never frozen; fresh cut french fries; fresh lettuce and tomatoes; and real American cheese.   I live just up the street from the Rural and 202 location. Like every other In-N-Out I have visited in the area, the store is clean and the staff are all friendly and each possesses many more brain cells than your average McDonald's or Burger King employee.   If you've never been, or rarely get to go, then you definitely want to go with the Double Double, fries and a shake. If you get to go there more frequently then you might want to scale back to a regular cheeseburger unless you have a really fast metabolism. Also, Google \"In-N-Out secret menu\" for a complete list of all the secret menu items such as animal style burgers and fries, 4X4's and the like. I definitely recommend the animal style fries...so tastey."}
{"text":"You already know their burgers are consistenly good and simple. The dining room is always clean. What made this location better than other locations is that it's not as packed as the other ones across town."}
{"text":"Visiting the new Fiesta Mall In N Out Burger in Mesa a few times and despising the food, especially the soggy nasty fries, I tried this one in AJ to give it a chance. It was lunch time and just packed as these places get. Oddly enough with inside packed, line outside the door and people eating outside, we got in the long drive through line and I don't think we spent too much longer than five minutes. The fries were awesome and crispy and FRESH and a pretty good burger and nice fattening chocolate shake. Great, fast service and the food was GOOD! I think I'll go back some day!"}
{"text":"Self explanatory pretty much, I mean you can't really not LOVE IN-n-OUT burgers, I am not a big fan of fast food myself, but when it comes to this place I can't say no. Very clean, fries are freshly made and the burger is good too. I can't leave this place without getting a milkshake. Everyday after I'm done with my classes I have to pass by and get a shake at the one next to UNLV, even though its always soo busy."}
{"text":"Damn I love this place the burgers are always fresh the fries are always crispy and delicious this location is located on Rock Springs and Lake Mead on the corner right off the highway. The line at the drive-thru line is busy is busy but it goes by pretty fast. I can't say enough about how fast are hamburgers are and how delicious their fries I also got a milkshake for my kid who loved it and I will definitely come back to this In and Out Burgers I don't know why this particular one has better burgers on the other locations."}
{"text":"Double double extra spread, extra tomatoes... probably one of the best service you can get in a fast food joint."}
{"text":"First visit to in and out and we loved it. We don't have these places on the east coast and we've heard many great things. Happy to say there were no let downs. This place has amazing burgers and I can't say enough. Too bad there's none in Florida... who's knows maybe our dreams will come true."}
{"text":"Finally, the moment I've been waiting years for!!!  In and Out on the strip.  Need I say more!! Best burgers around!"}
{"text":"When you need a fast food burger this place is simply the best. My favorite is protein style, animal style, and large fries with sauce."}
{"text":"Aways receive great quality food. Costumer service is great. Lines aren't that long and always receive food quickly"}
{"text":"What a great place! Double double animal style with fries; really nothing on earth can beat that. Service is prompt, food came out hot and delicious and the restaurant is clean and spacious. Definitely a great place to grab a burger!"}
{"text":"Greatest burgers in the world!! Not expensive either. I could eat eat here everyday!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this two stars, because In-n-Out food is always delicious!  As a former resident of SoCal, I've been to many different In-n-Outs.  Yesterday I was at this location around 11:10am, I was the seventh car in line-not bad considering In-n-Out's typically buzz through the line.  Not this location, it took me 20-25 minutes to get to the second (food) window.  Note:  none of the cars in front of me had large orders.  The cashier appeared to be really annoyed or frazzled, was griping at her co-workers about something and she never bothered to greet me.   So weird, In-n-Out always prides itself on service.  This location should be called, \"In-n-Wait for it\".  If you're hungry for In-n-Out go to the location on Eastern Avenue, they are super quick and very friendly."}
{"text":"Originally from SoCal, been eating InNOut for 30 years.  Slowest drive service in 30 years at this location.  I was worried they were being held up, or that their line cooked passed out.  Slow, Slow, Slow."}
{"text":"I rarely make reviews but after today's experience with this particular in n out this review was the LEAST I could do! I decided to go to in n out during my lunch break and As I pulled up to pay at the window I couldn't believe what happened! I had forgotten my wallet!! I was so embarrassed I apologized and asked to cancel my order. As I pull up to the next window the man handed me my burger,fries and drink he said it had been made already and would've been tossed out anyway and not to worry about it.  Once again apologizing repeatedly I took my food and said thank you so much! I know the meal is under $10 and to some people not much but it's the principal behind it. I know people read this to find food reviews but for those who don't know they have the best burgers and fries hands down!! Not Only is the food great the staff is AMAZING I'm returning tomorrow to pay for my meal if they don't accept it then I will be paying it forward! Thank you to the staff at this location I am truly grateful!"}
{"text":"Not a bad price for what you get. Food was pretty good. Them double doubles are good but the fries were kinda sad. Long lines. Especially the drive through"}
{"text":"Theres only one word to describe this place... DELICIOUS!  From the burgers to the fries animal style everything! its amazing  from the moment you walk in you a greeted by a friendly staff there outfits remind you of a classic burger joint.  I had to go online to find out about there secret menu or there items not listed like Animal style burger and fries. Neopolitan shake, and different kinds of ways to get your burger.   One bite and they had me!   Im all over this review because I can't explain how much I love this place and there burgers!"}
{"text":"Came in for my first In-N-Out burger in about 15 years, since I live in Hawaii and they don't have any stores there. This location is in a busy strip mall in North Las Vegas. We got there around 1:30pm. Business was brisk but the place was not crowded. Our food came out fast and it was hot & fresh. Our cashier, Steve Me, was friendly and he answered our questions clearly and knowledgably. The fries were a bit bland and soft, but I won't knock them for that because some people like them that way (like my husband). We ate in the restaurant and then decided to get a chocolate shake. It came out almost before my husband finished ordering, lol. Talk about fast! To top off our experience, one of the workers made a round of the tables to check on the customers. So, we had a great meal with great service. These folks more than deserve maximum stars!"}
{"text":"I have tried everything on this damn menu. Animal fries? Great. Shakes? Great. Regular fries? Great. Burgers? Great. Customer service? Great. The people there are so friendly. They only downside to going here is probably how far it is and how PACKED it is ALL. THE. TIME. Once after I came back from a fair with my friend at 11 pm and we went to in and out and it was full of people. A majority of them being Asian, lol! But when i go there its not like i wait for hours, its usually about a 10-15 minute wait for your take OUT. You cant even eat there since its always packed, the only free seat there is probably the head of the cashier or something ."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is my favorite place to eat. Even when they are slammed, they have the best burgers on the run you can find. 3x2, Animal style, no lettuce, no tomato, and add chiles. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Drive thru is slow when it should be faster   When I'm in a hurry drive thru is a better option but not here it's super slow, but food is great !"}
{"text":"Not really sure what the big deal is with In N Out...I'm from Illinois so maybe the people living in AZ just don't know what a good burger is. In any case they are nothing special and I definitely don't recommend them"}
{"text":"Man, they really pack on the onions! Looked like they had packed a salad in between the buns. The burgers were well done and seasoned and the fries weren't greasy or too salty. We came during dinner time and it was packed, but we still didn't wait long for our food not was it cold. Would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"What can you say about In-N-Out that hasn't already been said?  This is a staple of West Coast cuisine and by far the most consistently amazing burger I've ever had.  I have trust issues with most fast food places.  Five Guys usually doesn't let me down, but they have.  Let's not even talk about Carl's Jr and McDonalds, places where the burgers look sad and the fries have already committed suicide.  So when I'm looking to pick up something quick, there's really only one place I can rely on to be amazing.  In-N-Out is always on the ball.  There's a reason that business is always booming.  They get their job done quickly and efficiently - no fuss, no muss.  Their ingredients are fresh and always yummy.  Although their primary menu is simple (and remarkably cheap! Seriously!), the hidden menu gives you a wide variety of options to choose from.  Want your fries well done?  No problem.  Want your fries covered in grilled onions and special sauce?  Order them animal style.  Personally, my cheeseburger is always ordered animal style/protein style.  Wrapped in lettuce and dripping with special sauce is exceedingly messy, but good lord, does it taste good.  If you've never had In-N-Out, stop thinking about it and just go!  Once you've had it, other fast food places just won't taste the same."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of in n out burgers, all ingredients are fresh.  The price and quality are tops!!!"}
{"text":"For the record, I'm not really the biggest fan of their burgers in general. But the customer service is what really ruins it for me.  If you wait in line for 30 minutes I would expect that someone would come outside and let you know their credit card machine isn't working. That way you're not stuck in line for another 30 minutes while you wait for everyone else to get food expect you.  Also, make sure you ask them to try your card at the window, it will work 10 times out of 10. The kid at the window will make sure to tell you, with attitude, that \"if your card doesn't go through it won't mean you get free food.\" My card had worked every time. They just don't want to make food past 1:00, even though they're open till 1:30 Friday and Saturday.  Seriously. If you're going to not accept credit/debit cards past 12:30 then maybe put a sign up, and you'll need to make a few more exits in your drive through so people don't have to wait for 1 hour."}
{"text":"I'm tempted to take off a star for the pricing at In-N-Out Burger as I find their prices to be slightly above what I consider fair for an amazing burger. But since their burgers are great--I will keep them at 5 stars. This location, like many of their locations, is usually very busy. However, considering that they are right down the street from ASU (where everyone loves them) I think their level of busyness is understandable. I've never had to wait more than 7-10 minutes at this location and I usually have a special order and visit during peak times. Besides the fact that their burgers taste amazing (ask practically anyone, they'll say the same thing) I love how fresh everything there is--if it goes into your food it is fresh and never frozen. I also like the fact that In-N-Out Burger pays their workers well, it is refreshing to see a company treat their workers with dignity and respect."}
{"text":"Whoa!  My kid will actually eat something other than chicken nuggets now!!"}
{"text":"I have to say that the In and Out at this location is one of the best run fast food places I have ever been to. I frequent the restaurant about 2 times a month. I ran the operations for one of the top 2 fast food competitors for 10 years and certainly know the challenges in the industry. The speed and quality of the service and the cleanliness is consistently an A level.  Also all the staff are extremely friendly and highly proficient.  Kudos to all involved in the operation of this location on Tatum in Desert Ridge!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for 8 years nothing has changed 1 bit the workers are nice people check out their not-so-secret menu and you won't be dissapoi Ted I always get the animal fries with a double double or a 3x3 if you pick up someone from the east coast from McCarran airport and take them there they will fall in love and won't be dissapointed at all and will want to come back for more."}
{"text":"This burger stand is great ! It would be awesome if they had a bigger menu. In N Out Burger was developed in the 1950's and that's their style. However I tried their fries and it was cold. Lol... It's still a good place to grab a quick bite to eat. This is not the burger place I would eat to everyday though."}
{"text":"I ordered from the In-N-Out on 4840 N. 20th St., 85016 in Phoenix, AZ at 6:30PM on Saturday, December 24 2016.   I was so impressed with the staff during my visit. Let me tell you why: The girl who took my order on the iPad in the drive-thru wished me a Merry Christmas. The guy at the first window charged me for my order. I paid. I went to the next window and the attendant also asked me to pay. Confused, I told her I had already paid and handed her my receipt. She seemed surprised, took the receipt and walked away to talk to her manager. Maybe the guy at the first window wasn't supposed to charge me? Either way, I wasn't mad. The manager came to the window and told me the first window attendant had accidentally charged me with the wrong order. I didn't mind at all. No big deal to me. My food still came out on time. However, the manager was so nice and apologized profusely. He gave me my money back and also took care of my meal for the night and apologized again. The window attendant girl also apologized. I was just so blown away at how nice, accommodating and professional the manager on this shift was. Especially for someone who was working on Christmas Eve. It was clear he really cared about his customers and his employees. I didn't catch his name but I just wanted to post this review so that In-N-Out knows that they hired an excellent manager. It made me feel happy on Christmas Eve. Thank you!"}
{"text":"It's good if you choose from the animal style menu, otherwise I've had better. Avoid the vegas ones between 12 and 4 unless you want to sit in a drive thru line for an hour!"}
{"text":"The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful.  The food tasted heavenly.  The facilities were spotless.  I really liked this place!"}
{"text":"Really good but really bad for you at the same time. Double double animal style with animal fries is the way to go."}
{"text":"I walked from the Palms casino bus stop down to the In N Out last night, and I had an interesting walk since I didn't know at the time that S Valley View was not a through street. I got exactly what I ordered, I was at the location about 8:00pm on a Friday night and there were about twenty-five orders ahead of me; so the waiting time was pretty good. Martha is a great cashier, everyone at In N Out had a positive attitude. The parking at this location isn't too bad from what I saw. There is a lot of traffic going on and off I-15 near this location, so be prepared to spend up to ten minutes looking for a parking space."}
{"text":"First visit, as we are from Florida. Burger good. Fries terrible. I would go out of my way for a Five Guys over In and Out."}
{"text":"My favorite In-N-Out spot. The food is fuego and the service here is always great. Special shout out to Haylie who was really polite and helpful with an order I had a few weeks back."}
{"text":"I would like to give them 0 stars but that wasn't an option.  Went thru the drive thru this evening and ordered cheeseburgers and fries.  Got home bit into the so called hamburger only to find a paper thin hamburger.  Really?  That's the best they can do?  Lots of lettuce but no meat.  Checking them off my list of places to eat burgers!!!  Never again!!"}
{"text":"First off I love in-n-out for life lol, I've been going ever since I was a kid, however it was the California location, which for some reason always has that authentic taste but ever since moving out here, I've gone to this one every time because it tastes just as good!! But every time I go they always seem to forget something on my order.."}
{"text":"Hier gibts die weltweit besten Burger, alles frisch zubereitet. In-n-Out ist absolutes Muss für jeden USA-Besucher!!!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out is awesome!  The fries are so fresh and the burgers are soooo tasty!  I always get the double double without cheese of course!  I hate cheese.  They are very efficient and the line moves really quick.  The service is great.  I never had a bad experience at In-N-Out yet!  I will continue to come here when I can.  =)    Oh and I forgot, the animal style is pretty good too!  If you haven't tried it yet then you need to!"}
{"text":"I love in-n-out burger, very reasonable prices.  Never had a bad burger or service here.  Theres always a line, which is not neccesarily a bad thing.  Whenever i got a craving for a good quick burger i go here."}
{"text":"I love inn and out! They have the best customer service and they always get me my food in a timely matter!"}
{"text":"Asked for grilled onions on my burger and got raw then I asked for no onions on my animal fries but instead got onions no cheese."}
{"text":"I gave this location 4 stars and the Sahara location 5 because of my experience at this one was not as good as it should've been.my fault, not the staff's.  The lovely Esther was a very friendly cashier and the line of 6 people ahead of me was very fast.Food came out very quickly(my usual double double animal style, fries and root beer) and was delish.  the only bad part about the experience was eating indoors.to me, In-N-Out is not a sit-down kinda place.It was meant to be eaten in a car, with music playing and burger juices dripping all over the seat and steering wheel.I'm sorry I had to learn that the hard way...."}
{"text":"i moved to the bowels of Las Vegas about 6 months ago from southern California.the one thing i miss the most about SoCal is In-N-Out.luckily the California staple is well represented out here in Vegas.over the past 6 months i have lost about 40lbs and abstained from pretty much all junk food.last Wednesday was the day i rewarded myself.pulled into the drive-thru and ordered a Double Double animal style with fries and root beer.i was greeted by friendly and cute jailbait and got my grub.found a spot in the parking lot and took a huge bite out of the burger.my tastebuds orgasmed and i had a near-psychedelic experience as i recalled my teenage years of eating In-N-Out in the car while stoned as a mother and blasting heavy metal music.after the 1st bite, i stopped blasted some tunes and continued my feast.the burger seemed to talk to me with each bite saying, \"EAT ME!OH YES, TAKE A BIGGER BITE, CHEW HARDER, FASTER!EAT ME!\"  eat her i did."}
{"text":"Does it get any easier than this. What really makes it work for me is that they serve 7up!"}
{"text":"It's in and out.  It's good lol :).   Fast service, priced right and good food.   Enjoy"}
{"text":"Beautiful, juicy, low-cost, aesthetically pleasing burgers. There's no better burger than the In-N-Out burger, don't @ me."}
{"text":"I grew up in La Verne, CA...home of In-n-out #3. I love in-n-out. However, i give this location a 4/5 because they hardly ever get my order down as I speak it. Most in-n-out locations are quick to understand my order...especially the originals out in CA. I love the food and the staff is great. I just wish they could get my order right without me having to repeat myself a couple of times."}
{"text":"I don't understand what the big deal is about this place. I don't find the food all that tasty. In fact, I hate the food. The staff is always really nice. But because this place is so popular, the parking and wait is always a pain, and I just don't feel the food is yummy enough to deal with it. I think this place is more of a pop culture status symbol. I'd rather eat at Sonic."}
{"text":"Besides having literal Nazi's (the biggest talker had a great big Reich eagle tattooed on his forearm and proudly displayed it for all to see) talk shit about us the entire time me and my Jewish girlfriend were in line, they served 14 other people before they got our order out, and served it right next to order 88. In n out is run by and serves literal Nazis. Who knew? I won't be back, but I think that was the point they were trying to make."}
{"text":"The line was out the door but it moved fast not even 10 minutes to chow on the Ultimate double double!!! Awesome!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out is even good for us vegetarians--at least once in awhile, for a guilty splurge. Order the not-on-the-menu grilled cheese (has everything a cheeseburger would come with, sans burger). Even though it's not on the menu, it does exist within their ordering system, so don't feel bad ordering it! Add to that some fries (we order ours \"cooked well\" for a little extra crunch)... yum.  I seriously don't know how they keep their staff as continually professional and perky as they do. And it's not just this location, either--all locations are equal. They run a tight ship and do it with a smile. Even if the drive-thru line is backed up and around the corner, it's worth the wait! (and if there's a line at all, it's because everything is being made fresh as the orders come in--not because they're screwing around inside).  If we could eat there daily without gaining a billion pounds and going into immediate cardiac arrest, we'd do it! ;-)"}
{"text":"Fresh food that's pretty tasty and quick. Burgers were great. Place is a little dirty on the inside."}
{"text":"Good, cheap, burgers. Fries are/not very greasy, service is excellent, even when busy. Ask for fresh fries. !!!"}
{"text":"Prices are great. Food wasn't anything spectacular. Comparable to McDonalds."}
{"text":"_________nom_____nom______nom______yessssss_________  1st of All  In-N-Out is the best burger ever not just on the west coast but on EARTH! You just can't forget the TASTE, these will call your name from your burger loving subconscious, saying \"NOM ME\", so taste is 5 Stars, ten even, no, A MEEEEELLION!  These PRICES are better than any fast food place for the quality of food your getting here, for example: The Buns have been Made just for  In-N-Out by Puritan Bakery, which has supplied these buns for In-N-Out Burger since the late 1950s, using only high quality all natural ingredients, They don't have preservatives and are used when fresh, just like everything else at  In-N-Out. This has got to be why it doesn't smell like a fat sweaty trucker (ahem MacDonalds) when you walk in the door, it actually smells like delicious appetizing food! So price and Quality are Tops.  The SERVICE is always atypically friendly, Its like they hire former Disney Characters, Im pretty sure they are like glowing sparkle Fairys or perhaps some other form of semi- Magical people. You just don't get 'tude here, ever. EVER. So staff is excellent.   CLEANLINESS is one of my hang ups, I can spot a speck of ketchup on a wall at 50 yards, or a dust fragment from space, But at this particular  In-N-Out Location, I know they have seriously high scrutiny for cleanliness. My last visit was just yesterday and they had a supervisor literally giving the wallpaper the ol' White Glove treatment, scouring the place for any specks of dirt, lifting up the fake plants and looking under the bins of salt & pepper packages, even searching the window shades for any sign of dirt. The folks behind the counter had White, clean aprons on and the whole place just gleamed with cleanliness. LOVE.   In-N-Out will you marry me?"}
{"text":"Dirty restaurant.  There was hair in my burger. I gave this place a second try after that. Poor customer service! These people do not want to work. All mad just taking orders in drive thru and walk up. Restroom is filthy. Will make the drive to another in and out. Grossest in and out I have ever been too"}
{"text":"Forgot to give me my animal fries , never went back for them , first time ever mistake"}
{"text":"Excellent place to stop by and have a quick bite to eat. Try to avoid going around lunch time as the wait for the food was a little longer than most fast food chains. But it was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Always great clean food. I eat there all the time and they are so good about not making a mistake on the order. Competitors sometimes dont listen to your order and are inaccurate at high volumes but them manage to stay accurate even when they are extremely busy."}
{"text":"I really kind of love In-N-Out.  Even if they serve a little proselytizing with their fries, which would normally drive me nuts.  I fell in love with In-N-Out in Southern California in another life, and I was thrilled to find them here.  I'm a vegetarian.  I get the grilled cheese without grilled onions (because the onions are cooked on the same grill as the burgers).  It always hits the spot.  I don't care for the fries.  And not because of the Bible verse on the wrapper.  They taste too potatoy, or something.  But the chocolate shake deserves it's own paragraph.  Oh.  My.  Gosh.  I think it's vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce mixed in rather than chocolate ice cream.  And it's lovely.  I think when my family comes out in the fall I will take them to In-N-Out.  They will think I'm crazy, until they have their first bite."}
{"text":"Drive thru was fast and the drive thru employee, Amber was super nice! Excellent service!"}
{"text":"???????????????????????"}
{"text":"I love love love this place! Even tho I've got violently I'll after eating here twice...I continue to come back because I love the food !  came again tonight, and my burger is raw!  I know they are extremely busy, but I waited 10 mins....what's a few more?? I love the food.....but pray I'm not sick again tomorrow!  I can't take another star away...the only reason for 4 is because of tonight ,and now wondering if I've truly been sick because of this!"}
{"text":"So much better than 5 guys and well worth the money. Simple menu and always delicious. Best fast food burger joint there is."}
{"text":"Service is always fast and friendly. I always get the double double animal style, fries and a drink, sometimes I'll get their shake which is also really good. I would choose In n Out Burger over McDonalds any day for service, food and price!"}
{"text":"I've always loved their cheeseburgers but never really liked their fries.  They always seemed soft, cold and limp (hmm?)  Well my co-worker mentioned that he recently had fries animal style and it peaked my interest.  I picked up an order along with a cheeseburger and I almost didn't eat my burger.  The fries were smothered in cheese, grilled onions and thousand island sauce.  I know it sounds weird but it was really good!    I still can't figure out why in-n-out tries to keep some of their menu items secret, but I won't complain as long as people share their experiences.  My other favorite off menu item is their yummy grilled cheese with grilled onions."}
{"text":"Bang for your buck! Delicious burgers but the fries aren't that great. They need a little salt, and they're kinda small. But for $3.60, you can't go wrong! We got a great cashier. Give Sebastian a raise!"}
{"text":"I've been reading about \"In-N- Out\" for the last ten years.  It seems every time I read a novel, people in it are stopping at the local In-N-Out for hamburgers.  When I saw they had one in Scottsdale, I just had to stop and see if what it was all about.  Even though I don't usually eat hamburgers, this was a chance I couldn't pass up.  I went in to the restaurant so I could savor the whole atmosphere.  It was quite different from McD's but in a very pleasant way.  It could just be the location, but there was a wide mix of people, from women who had obviously been shopping, to soccer families,  to workers who were taking a break. The interior was clean, and the help was very friendly, even with the customer that had a finicky complaint.  There is little choice on the menu, so I sampled the cheeseburger, fries and a shake.  It was great.  A step above BK, McD's, and even Carl's -  I understand that they use fresh ingredients, and maybe that is the difference. But I do know that I like the food better than other fast food burger places.  Again, I do not eat hamburgers all that often, but if I do have a craving in the future for one, I, too, will head to In-N-Out."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Vegas we make it a point to stop here at least once. This time I got the Double double combo. Whoa  talk about a huge burger. And of course my kids had to get animal style fries. So good and reasonable priced!"}
{"text":"We do not have these in our area so I was excited to finally have the chance to try this chain.  I was pleased with burger, it was quality tasting and very fresh, especially for a fast food burger.  The fries were just ok, except the ones we had animal style.  These were flavorful and very interesting.  The shake we ordered was good, but nothing special.  Entire experience was ok, burgers definitely the show stopper here."}
{"text":"Stopped in because we were told that these guys really had it right. And we must admit they are doing not only one thing right, they are doing a lot of things right.   We noticed that the place was not overly advertised in the decor; its simplicity is enough to get the message across that you're here for the food and not for the decor.   We noticed that they really do have a system in place. We saw how a team of people really gel and work together. It was welcoming to see how right they all work together and the care they take to make everything.   We saw them slicing the potato to be cooked fresh. How the hamburgers were being built with precision. It was just amazing to see.   The food was really good. We ordered a double cheeseburger that was really tasty. A simple touch of toasting one side of the bun gave our burger that nice crunchy taste (not too much but just enough) where others just get soggy, especially towards the end of the burger, not this place.   If you have the opportunity, make this a place that you simply must try.   We're just sorry they don't have one near where we live."}
{"text":"Doesn't get better than this! Get a taste of California here with their freshly made fries and burgers. I love the shakes as well! The service is quick and friendly. One of my top 10's for sure."}
{"text":"The first time I ever had an In N Out Burger was in Los Angeles about 8 years ago or so, the whole family loved them, we couldn't get enough, and had to get some on the way to airport.  Had it here twice, super busy at Lunch Time.. but honestly it wasn't what I remembered. The burger was just okay. I actually didn't mind not finishing it when I had to leave quickly. Which is pretty rare for me. The food I do like I will frequent and give good business to, but after having it here twice I don't really have any desire to try it again.   Burger seemed over cooked, and too much iceberg lettuce for my liking. Personally, on a burger I think it should be either alot of romaine lettuce or spinach, or just a little bit of iceberg. I find that when you have too much Iceberg lettuce( which has very little taste and adds nothing special to the burger) that is makes the burger have less taste, flavor, and overall makes the burger lack anything special or memorable.  Shakes are decent, but nothing to write home about, just a really basic shake with no whipped cream or any other quality touch to set it apart. It was honestly such a Meh experience.   My Sonic burger on Sahara near the dealerships is by far much better. They make their Cheeseburgers and double cheeseburgers super good. Not alot of iceberg lettuce, fresh tomato, finely chopped onions, on a soft bun and a nicely done patty. Worth the slight wait at the drive thru.  I go and get one at Sonic whenever I crave a good burger, also for their shakes that are half off, which is a good deal for a quality shake with so many flavors to choose from.   Sonic is surprisingly superior to In N Out for their burgers, and I'm not sure if its known for that, but I highly recommend if you want a good quality burger that's big, juicy, and tastes fresh."}
{"text":"Las Vegas & Henderson currently has ten In-n-Out's. My wife and I have eaten at seven of them.....and we don't even live in Vegas! So, we eat at In-n-Out almost every time we go there. Every location has been great. This one (and the one on Blue Diamond) are not as crowded as other locations.   My favorite is the double-double \"animal style\", which means they put mustard on the beef while cooking, add grilled onions, extra sauce and add pickles. Pickles are not put on their burgers unless you ask for them, or order \"animal style\". When I'm really hungry I get a 3x3 'animal style', which is three patties and three slices of cheese. You can even get a 4x4 or 5x5 etc..,.   The quality is always great. I don't know why, but their burgers always TASTE better than any other fast food burger place I've been to.   Oh, and they also have fresh potatoes that they cut in front of you.  The fries doesn't get any fresher than that!"}
{"text":"Love it !  Everytime I come to Arizona or head West I grab a burger animal style!"}
{"text":"can't go wrong with an in and out burger. I like to get animal style which is never on the menu but hey all know how to make it.  great cheap in  Vegas which has increasingly become very expensive."}
{"text":"Sometimes a person just needs a number 1 with a chocolate shake. Later that person needs to run several miles and have a salad, but at least once a month I always make that choice haha. Awesome burger, awesome fries (only when fresh), and awesome shakes."}
{"text":"For me, the best burger in any price category! The place is always busy, the employees are great. Customer service is excellent. I always order the double double cheesburger with onions and a side of fries. Always fat and happy after I stuff my face."}
{"text":"My first time having an IN-N-OUT burger and definitely was not disappointed.  I love the sauce which is what makes an in-n-out burger in-n-out.  I love that their menu is limited to a few items, hamburger, cheeseburger, fries.  The burger was delicious and fries were not too oily.  I miss it already.  I will try the animal fries next time I head out to the west coast.  The staff at this location was friendly, we had a pretty confusing order, he got it right and did it with a smile."}
{"text":"After a fun evening of watching The Garage Boys play music at Carnaval Court between Harrah's and The Linq, we were looking for something quick to eat before calling it a night.  We noticed that In-N-Out was close by so decided to give it a try.  My wife spoke highly about eating at different In-N -Out Burger joints in the past.   They have a very simple menu with only a few options.  It was very busy but they definitely live up to their name.  The food arrived quickly and was what I expected.  I had the Double Cheeseburger with Fries.  It was a good burger, but if you are expecting something special, you might go somewhere else.  The Fries were kind of disappointing to me.  It was like they weren't deep fried or something.  They were just dry and not as good as other fast food options in my opinion.    Overall it was a good, reasonably priced, quick place to grab some food after a night of drinking.  They must be doing something right for how long the chain has been in business with such a simple business plan.  It met my expectations and we will go there again if it is up to my wife.  She really likes it!"}
{"text":"Usually have a good experience at this location, but I was treated very poorly by the cashier Zac. Very unfriendly, forgot my drink, and when I asked him to for it he responded as if if was my fault. Get someone at the register with a smile and good personality."}
{"text":"easily one of my fav fast food burger joints ever, you can never go wrong with animal style double double and fries, with their thick chocolate shakes. yum"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love In-N-Out always clean and employes morale keeps you coming back."}
{"text":"Beautiful place, fast, reliable and consistent!! The workers are so friendly even though it can get extremely busy. Burgers are incredible and most of the workers are pretty cute which is nice."}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant. The bathrooms are spotless. The food service was very quick, efficient and friendly. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for high-quality fast food."}
{"text":"I don't get it. I've been, oh, probably 10 times. I get the cheeseburger meal. Now, don't get me wrong, the burgers are excellent. The fries? Not so much. Ok, sure, they are fresh, but they have no flavor and taste like cardboard. Its cheap, so thats always a plus. They are always super busy and I get it. But I can't agree with the 5-star reviews. If there was a 3.5 review, thats what I'd give. I'm in between a 3 and 4.   If you want a GREAT hamburger and support a local restaurant, ran by local owners, head down to university drive in tempe and get an amazing burger at The Chuckbox.  If you stick with a chain? I think Fatburger has these guys beat."}
{"text":"I have never ever met a staff who was so friendly, welcoming and helpful. Seriously I told my boyfriend something's wrong lol they are so happy!!!! Lol they helped us order (it was our first time) they even tended to my daughter and gave her some stickers and a hat! They got pretty slammed in the back but they literally pulled together. I'm watching from the booth looking for some sort of flaw. Lol the food was Delish! The restaurant was clean! This was by far the best fast food restaurant I've EVER been to. Idk if this is how all the in and out staff is but this location was a A+!"}
{"text":"It's cheap, it's edible & it's nothing special.  Very thin patty on unseeded bun and average fries."}
{"text":"I love in n out! I came here through the drive thru and it was a short wait which i was pleased about. when I got home my fries were cold and soggy and my patty was uncooked ( I stay very close five minutes away). For there not being a wait or longs line I expected better."}
{"text":"I loveeeee this place they dont have them back home. Very very busy location, always a line but it moves so quicky food is always fresh and fast."}
{"text":"I's the staple of Las Vegas burgers, I had to go 5 stars because of the animal style fries! It put it over the top!"}
{"text":"Their burgers are fantastic, and the service is wonderful.  It's an unusual combination making the service staff suspect.  I'm not sure what makes them so cheery, and I suspect there's something going on....  They are always smiley, helpful, and bubbly, regardless of how late it is.  I suspect this behavior is insincere.  The Chandler location is open super-late, although they don't take care of the 24-hour professions like firemen, policemen, or hospital staff, which would've easily given them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Favorite burger joint in Vegas I always get the double double with a chocolate shake."}
{"text":"I was really happy with my recent visit here. The customer service was great. I went thru the drive thru and the guy that served me was generous enough to open the AC for me without me asking (I wasn't even gonna ask because I didn't know they had any outside). It was 141 in my car and it was evident I was on the verge of death so I was beyond thankful for his service. The food was really good too, you get what you pay for. I also enjoy their simple menu easy to pick something and move on without holding the line for too long."}
{"text":"Compared to the other ones, the employees in this one are much more rude. When my mom, who speaks English with a strong accent, made an order, they purposely watered down the soda to the point where you can't even taste it! This behavior is totally uncalled for, and I hope the manager reads this."}
{"text":"This is a combined review of several In-N-Out locations that I have been to in California and Las Vegas.  All of them have been the same... underwhelming.  I consider them very average burger joints and would actually give them 3 stars if they weren't so overhyped.  I hear so many rave reviews that I keep giving them another chance but am always disappointed.  It's kind of like going to see a blockbuster movie after reading the book.  It's never as good as you expect.  The people who haven't read the book really like the movie but it's still not the same.  That's how I feel about In-N-Out after being spoiled by eating at better burger places, it's just not up to par.  At least the prices are reasonable but that still doesn't make it worth the typically long wait."}
{"text":"We have visited this location about 5 times. Most recently right before closing. The food was hot and fresh like always. Good burgers for a good price. The milkshakes, in our opinion, are not very good."}
{"text":"The best ever cheap,good,tasty,fresh nice employes i recommend it  my fav i eat it 3times a day"}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat!!!! I can eat here everyday and not get tired of the same food!!!! Moms idea to come here today!! Shes an addict lmao!!!!"}
{"text":"No complaints. All around good.   Convenient location.  Not crowded.  Fast service.   Tasty burgers.   I was a good girl and skipped the milkshake today."}
{"text":"Seems like every time k go here I have an issue. Today I told the employees I wanted my burger with only tomatoes and extra sauce. I had to tell the guy who took my order twice and he reassured me that it was right. When I got to the window the girl told me my order which was wrong and I corrected her then too. When I got my food it had only onion and tomatoes on it.. I'm not going back im over it.."}
{"text":"Best burgers when it comes to fast food. I like the double double with fries and a milkshake."}
{"text":"I LOVE In-N-Out!  The food is consistently good and the service is always friendly!!!  I can not say that anything in particular stands out at this location, but it was the one closest to my house and so it was the one that I visited the most.  A double-double w/animal fries is a must!  The prices and food are right on target, I miss it so much! :("}
{"text":"Its cheap, greasy and fast.... I don't understand the rage that makes it so popular. The burger seemed so ordinary, and the fries were good but nothing to write home about. I ordered a double cheese \"animal style\" and it was fine. It was fast and affordable but unmemorable. I just don't get it. Its not as if I don't like the place, but my sales manager about pissed his pants when we spotted the restaurant. If he is happy, I'm happy."}
{"text":"Aways fresh! You can watch your meal get prepared. Quick and accurate service. My son loves the milkshakes."}
{"text":"I can't BELIEVE how blessed I am to be able to taste this luscious goodness dipped in deliciousness. It was like a dream come true! My taste buds were in heaven. The modern day delicacy of the burger has been taken to a whole new level of greatness. The fries... Oooh don't let me get in your way! They are to die for! Their soda is regular ol soda. Their milkshakes are a step into a blissfully peaceful mountain scape with flowing streams and tall pines. I can't wait to taste the savory flavors again. Probably tonight. Thank you In N Out. Thank you."}
{"text":"The Best in the West! Love the simplicity of the menu, just good old fashioned hot yumminess. This location was like a well-oiled machine, they moved the line quickly and efficiently and got the masses fed. A-Plus!"}
{"text":"For under 5 bucks you can get the best burger and fries combo, with a drink, that you will ever have. If you are from the east coast, or really any state other than California, Arizona, or Nevada, you need to go here. I highly recommend this one over the one off the strip behind the Excalibur just because that one is usually very busy, this one is not as much, more so for the college students and locals, even though it is not that far off the strip. but in terms of quality, all In N Outs are all about the same. They never get your order wrong, they all speak English (and clearly!) and the food is one of a kind good."}
{"text":"Always a classic when in Cali or the Southwest. Moved back to the Northwest this year and I definitely am missing the burgers. Go for a Double Double meal grilled onions. If your feeling like living on the wild side also make the fries \"animal style\". They put grilled onions and cheese all over the fries. It's delicious but filling.  Also they have a killer Neopolitan Shake. If you haven't been make sure you check it out!"}
{"text":"the problem is if you don't your food immediately, as in take it back to your hotel room, forget about it cold nasty animal fries and hamburger"}
{"text":"In-n-Out is 1 of my favorite franchise burger spots.. It's so cheap, quick service and it's aLways busy meaning the food is great! If I was a LocaL I'd come here daiLy!"}
{"text":"My favorite In n Out of them all !!!  Gotta grab me a double double protein style .....to die for !!"}
{"text":"I really am convinced that in n out is one of the best fast food restaurants out there. The burgers are great and the fries are great. The service is usually nice too."}
{"text":"This is always the first place I come right from the airport.  I crave the burgers big time!  I always order a double double protein style with onion and no sauce but have had just about everything on the menu and even several items not on the menu.  All are fantastic and I will continue to come here every time I am in my hometown."}
{"text":"Always get animal style burgers. Goodluck eating outside in the summer Four adults fit on the shaded side of the bench one person is left in the sun roasting like a mofo. Remember it closes on fri and sat  at1:30am."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Best burger anywhere! I really don't know what to say always a smiling face at the register always a delicious burger fries can be hit or miss and this place can get pretty busy sometimes. My favorite is a double double with grilled onions always a good choice."}
{"text":"Real good burgers, layout of the place is nice and I mean nice. I don't think it's too pricey but for sure a nice option to eat at with the family."}
{"text":"LOVE this place -- they do an amazing job. Ate here twice last weekend. Saw on the web that they have a new \"secret menu\" out, but I just ordered my standard #1."}
{"text":"The worst, most disgusting, dirtiest, third world,  botulism encrusted excuse for a burger place in the city!!!!!  I did NOT order a human hair ball with my fries, but that's exactly what I got! Half way through my fries, I reached into the box/cup/container thing........and I pull out a rolled up ball of hair. The worst part is....I really couldn't tell if it came from someones head, or somewhere else!  I can assure you the part of the so-called meal that I didn't ingest immediately went straight into the garbage can, and the part that I did ingest came out very soon afterwards.   Absolutely the WORST greasy spoon in town. I will never set foot in that place (or any other in n out) ever again!!!!!"}
{"text":"This staff ROCKS!!  Long drive thru line but was IN & OUT fast! Staff was friendly even on the drive thru speaker you could tell they were enjoying what they were doing! Hannah, Kyle, Annamarie & Andrew thank you for the great service!!"}
{"text":"Fist time to In N Out burgers. Ordered a cheeseburger animal style, fries and a strawberry shake. I consider Five Guys the best fast food burgers out there, this said, the In N Out cheeseburger was very good, but doesn't quite measure up to Five Guys. I found the patty a little too well done and dry to my taste.  The strawberry shake was very good also, not as good as Johnny Rockets, but one of the better shakes out there. The fries however were terrible, very bland, with the consistency of cardboard."}
{"text":"OHHHHHHHHHH BABY!!!! I love me some InNOut Burger.  Growing up in Arizona we didn't have InNOut Burger, so when we went to So Cal to visit family, the daily trips to InNOut were like mini vacations within our vacation.  You can imagine how happy I was when they started opening them in the Valley.  I absolutely love this place.  Try something off the secret menu.  3x3, 4x4, animal style, well done fries... grilled cheese! yup!  The service is always good, the restaurants are always clean, and the food is always fresh.  Can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"late night burger....check.... oh so good, its not the best of areas but if you can stand to see a few hooks after 10 on trop your good. in and out is one of those places where no matter you go they taste the same.. they do things the other fast food places dream of as far as it consistency goes...i have always loved these burgers and i usually go to the one on nellis by my house..thumbs up for single with grilled and a pink lemonade..enjoy"}
{"text":"So I gave In-n-Out a chance, but because of their employee Terri, I'm going to Jack-in-the-Box or Wendy's instead of In-n-Out from now on. Terri was the exact opposite of customer service, and they completely messed up my order despite verbally repeating it accurately back at me (the receipt mismatched with my order).  When I started making my order, Terri repeatedly interrupted me with redundant questions, which held up the already huge line behind me (the line curved into the dining area). To make matters worse, Terri scoffed at some points of my order (I was ordering a veggie burger, which is pretty common considering I'm not the only vegetarian/vegan in the world). I had to ask Terri to repeat my order, but they spoke waaay too fast. I had to ask Terri to repeat my order again at a normal pace, which held up the huge line even longer. Just when I thought this couldn't get worse, Terri literallly talked back to me when I asked for my receipt (I felt really sorry for the people waiting in line). Seriously? It's just a piece of paper. Chill.  So guess what? Despite Terri repeating my order accurately, the receipt showed a completely differently order. I had to ask for the pickles when my order was ready, and I guess Terri really didn't want me to get french fries. It's okay, I got fries from Jack-in-the-Box instead. Besides, the line was way too huge for me to wait to in just get some fries.  So yeah.... never coming back here again, lol. In-n-Out didn't live up to its expectations, and so don't expect to get your money's worth here."}
{"text":"I just waited close to 20 min in the drive through for a moderate sized line.. only to get cold food. The fries were dumped all over the bag and I was given one napkin. Won't go back!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite burger joints because they re the most consistent with great tasting burgers and fries!   No matter where I go, I always find myself comparing their burger to In-N-Out.  This particular location is a frequent stop for me and my friends.  The service is awesome and friendly! There burgers are delish and they really fast."}
{"text":"Andrew greeted us politely. Purchased a burger and fries with a shake. I was not aware they could make a neopolitan shake by mixing all 3 flavors but Andrew politely offered. Nice quick bite to eat and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I have celiac disease and can't have gluten but they are very accommodating. The lady that took my order was very friendly and helped me out. They even cut my daughters burger in 4's. The lady helped us to the table and even wiped it off for us. It's nice to be able to eat somewhere and they know how to deal with my food allergy."}
{"text":"DUH!! are you kidding...why do you think this place is like a cult fenom???? come on....best shakes ever...maybe get them half and half (half flavor half vanilla-bc they tend to be very rich) and their burgers are really good...come on-a place that offers grilled onions into the cheese on my cheese burger plus raw ones?? sign me up...(also sign me up for mouth wash!!!)  most places are never worth the hype but this place is!!!"}
{"text":"I don't eat meat, but I often stop for a neopolitan shake and fries. The staff is friendly, especially Kira!"}
{"text":"Before moving here I was told by friends \"Oh! You HAVE to try an In-N-Out Burger as soon as you get there.\" I did. Let me first say it is an exceptional burger. Every part of it was picture perfect. The taste should set the standard of what a burger should taste like. But, it wasn't until my second trip that I learned about asking for grilled onions since it wasn't listed on their over simplified menu. Somehow, I always end up biting through their two layers of wrapper and their fries just don't impress me much. The employees are very friendly and I dig the retro uniforms but I still don't see the charm that my friends boasted so much about. Maybe when I leave Vegas it will hit me and I will pass on the word that trying these burgers is a must.  It IS yummy but I don't get the hype. I will definitely come back again and again, but sometimes a squished simple cheeseburger from the golden arches does just as well."}
{"text":"The burgers are always great but there must not have been a manager on duty tonight. The animal fries were done too early and came out cold. The table in front of us was dirty from when we walked in to when we walked out. And they got my burger wrong even after I clarified twice. I hope service is not slipping because they just gave me back the same burger a little smushed for making  the corrections."}
{"text":"Love their fries! I always get a double order of fries! This location is a bit annoying on the access and parking lot but it's bell rd. everything is hard to get in and out of. Especially when it's as popular as in & out!"}
{"text":"My first review on yelp! and in-n-out is definitely worthy of it.  i was stoked to hear that a new in-n-out formed on trop and fort apache, an in-n-out less than 10 min drive from my house! (other in-n-outs i would have to drive no less than 15 min). so i decided to check this new location out yesterday. it was my first time eating in-n-out this year since i was in philly attending school. I had my fair share of descent quality fast food restaurants in philly (five guys, 500 degrees) but none of them come close to in-n-out status...whenever i would go to a fast food restaurant in philly, the in-n-out song would always play in my head...\"in-n-out...IN-N-OOOUUUTTT! thats what a hammmburgers allll about!!\" thats how much i missed it...  anyways, this is what i usually get: double-double, animal style (chopped and grilled onions) with extra lettuce and tomatoes (no extra charge), fries, and a coke. if im in the mood for it, i ask for animal style fries (chopped/grilled onion and their \"special sauce\" added to the fries) and a strawberry milkshake. i also usually ask for extra spread (their packaged \"special sauce\") and chili peppers (if you like some spice to your meal). their buns are always perfectly toasted, their meat patties are always flavorful and juicy, their vegetables are always fresh and tasty, and their special sauce is to DIE for...and the fact that around $5 will get you a meal makes me think...why even think about going to another fast food joint?  if you're the type who can't read long posting like this, ill try to make it as simple as possible: - ask me what my favorite movie of all time? I DONT KNOW - my favorite song of all time? NO CLUE - my favorite fast food joint of all time? EASY. IN-N-OUT  thats what a hamburgers all about"}
{"text":"Good as always. Lookup the secret menu online. You can order things in different ways"}
{"text":"I love in and out . It's always the to go place for a quick quality juicy burger at little cost. And they use fresh ingredients and use never frozen patties . The French fries are crisp and thin and perfectly salted as well."}
{"text":"Super fast service. Food is always great and they always seem so organized and clean. We don't spend a lot of time waiting. If there was ever a problem they fix it everytime with no rudeness."}
{"text":"It kills me to go a year between visits!  I can taste it right now. Oh how I crave In N Out.  I go every day I am near one.  Yes, they get crowded, but the pleasant staff moves people in and out like a well oiled machine. And it is so worth the wait.  Everything on their simple menu is divine.  Wish I had an In N Out burger right now...."}
{"text":"This fast food joint has a loyal Californians cult following. I, however, cannot give the In-N-Out Burger chain anything higher than 3 Stars. Selection is tiny, hamburger patties are tiny, and flavor is just OK. I much prefer Wendy's and McDonald's."}
{"text":"Cheeseburger was excellent, prepared and delivered quickly, and the service staff was very proactive keeping things clean. Great lunch Thank you! Mike"}
{"text":"Amazing,  need I say more?  Double double w onions mmmmmmmm obviously lacking on the menu but that's the way they set it up. They have. A secret menue, I'm mot a lover of it but ask if you want more options. For the price it's good. And I have to admit their oversized baby pins that hold their aprons on and cute as hell on the right person lol"}
{"text":"If I put an In-N-Out burger in a McDonald's wrapper, you'd hate it. I'd hate it. Everybody would hate it.  This place is one of those things that gives you some sort of perverted \"foodie cred\" if you claim you like it. Sure, I'd choose it over the big fast-food chains, but that's like saying I'd rather be kicked in my left testicle than in my right testicle.  In the end, I'm still being kicked in my nuts.  But if you're the type of person who thinks \"ironic t-shirts\" are actually witty, then you'll probably love In-N-Out."}
{"text":"I went here 4 times during my Vegas vacation. It might have been 5 times if they were open for Christmas! :P  Staff is friendly and nice."}
{"text":"In theory, all locations of a franchise should be the same (and all the locations I've visited in the Vegas were great) , but I feel this one is the best of them all. Simply put, simple and super delicious. Just the right balance of veggies, bun, and burger. Wish we had at least one location near Fairbanks, AK."}
{"text":"Had In N Out in Vegas this past weekend. First time having in n out in Vegas. As always the customer service was incredible. I ordered a #2 animal style on the burger and fries. Everything was so quick and order was 100% right. Restaurant was really clean and everyone was really friendly. Will definitely go back soon!  -Joe"}
{"text":"Great for a fast food place, but I just can't see giving more than a 3 star rating to any fast food place. This place definitely deserves the highest rating for a fast food place.  The best food is from their secret menu which you have to look up online. The best burger is \"animal style\" and I asked for free extra special sauce. If you're hungry, order the double double, but a single will satisfy an average appetite. With the extras, the burger is is great.  Instead of the regular fries, order the animal fries. They are covered with grilled onions, melted cheddar, and special sauce. Animal fries are excellent, but regular fries are nothing special.  Service was very good at peak time. The inside was packed and the drive thru line was backed up at least a dozen cars. Despite the crowd, we were able to place our order promptly. And our food came out after a short but expected wait. The staff was very efficient and friendly.  Overall, one of the best fast food places in town."}
{"text":"The food is great and the menu is simple. Burgers and fries, makes ordering fast and you don't have to wait behind someone trying to decide from a menu with 30 different things on it. The employees are always cheerful."}
{"text":"My first experience with In & Out Burger. The worker was so friendly and nice-loved him. We did have to wait awhile for our order, but it was worth the wait. The burgers are excellent!! The restaurant was very clean and nice. I'd definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Great. Great burgers. Great service. It will be a pretty long line though. But once you try the food you'll know why. Great. Just freaking great."}
{"text":"Thanks In N Out Burger for making me sick. Who ever was working on 1/14/2016 at 7:30pm was not practicing safe food handing techniques. Normally In N Outs are on point.  First girl who took my order in the drive thru was not friendly. Then the guy who took my money had wet hands and got who knows what on my card. I just hope that same guy didn't go back to making food without washing his hands thoroughly. When I got home my fries were not put into the bag properly causing half my fries to be overturned in the bag.  Won't ever visit this establishment again. Sad because I love In N Out."}
{"text":"In and Out burger is worth all the hype.  I live in Colorado and was amazed when I took my first bite into my burger.  What got me most is the burger is marinated in mustard and the home made fries are to die for!!!!!!!!!!!    When in the west coast I always hit In and Out burger."}
{"text":"THE PLACE:  Convenient at least for me. Right off the free way and on the drive home. Place is neat, of ample size, but still not big enough for the crowds that come here. There's plenty of parking.  My fave, plenty of space for the drive-thru line.  THE SERVICE: Well, it is fast food that does not disappoint on speed. Servers are friendly. And patient too, as I struggled to recall the appropriate name for a couple of secret menu items.  THE FOOD: Burger is okay and the main reason for the 3 stars. Could use a bit more beef as you can barely taste it. Veggies are always crisp. The fries... I can skip the burger for the fries I'll tell you that much. Especially well done fries.  My kiddos love their milkshakes. Thick and creamy. Smell it and you know it's gonna be good.  A-OK. For the price, it's still a good deal."}
{"text":"This is the closest location to my house.   The food is just as good as any other location most of the time. I love to get Animal style fries but it always takes forever to complete my order when I order them. They don't seem to be that hard to make but at least 2-3 people who ordered after me will get their food before me if I ordered animal style fries. This isn't a huge deal but I don't order them as often because of it.  The store has always been clean when I have visited it. And the line moves pretty fast even when they are busy."}
{"text":"In n out is the best. You won't find a better burger at this price point. I go to this location twice a week. I have never had a bad experience with the staff, or food. On occasion something isn't right in my order, I notify the staff at the counter and the  immediately fix the problem. Great location and staff."}
{"text":"No matter which one you go to, In n out is the best burger place on the planet (thus far).  The burgers and fries are made to order. And delicious.  I highly recommend the double double which has double meat and cheese.  The burgers are loaded with good veggies and sauce, the fries fresh and crsip, the shakes thick and creamy.  I recommend In n Out for anyone who likes to eat, likes burgers, and has hunger."}
{"text":"Always amazing. Food is fast, hot and served why very attentive staff. Even when the line is long and I think I'm going to be stuck, I never am."}
{"text":"I wanted to start off with a big thank you to the kids working today at the eastern and serene location in Las Vegas. The respect and good work ethic behind all of them is outstanding! In the short amount of time that we were there, two very rude customers were as well. I, as well as my fiancé, were very impressed with the staff and how they handled the customers. The first one was a lady who was obviously on her lunch break from goodwill. She continued to interrupt other customers to ask how much longer her order would take.  The second was a man, whom, from the moment he walked in, was treating staff inappropriately and seemed very agitated for reasons unknown to me. We lost our appetite immediately after he began yelling at the young man with his French fries. He was screaming about needing fresh fries very condescendingly. The young man kept calm and cool, he apologized and accommodated to the barbaric  mans requests.   The staff's professionalism in the matter is what I wanted to write this for.  They deserve praise for their hard work and outstanding customer service.  As two people in the service industry, we appreciate when others can do all that these kids did today.  Shake it off kids, there are people who notice your hard work.  This location, in particular, has always impressed me. Always busy, yet always uniform delicious food and customer service."}
{"text":"These guys are awesome. We have someone in the family with celiacs disease so there are very few places we can go out to eat and rarely do. Sometimes you just feel like getting some fatty burgers and they do a great job with keeping everything separate for him."}
{"text":"Dirt Cheap and Damn good. There really isn't anything I can say about In-N-Out that has not been already said.  Oh and one of my favorites is the Neapolitan Shake (You have to special order it but its worth it)."}
{"text":"Came here today. Drive thru was busy. Haven't really been eating fastfood, but I prefer these burgers compared to mcdonalds. Just wanted a double double with onions and extra lettuce, no fries or drink. About 4 dollars. The quality is usually the same. I don't even ask how I want my onions cut or cooked. That's usually when they can get it wrong. I come here about once a month for a burger fix."}
{"text":"Double double animal style with a strawberry shake.  Life doesn't get much better than this."}
{"text":"I've never been to an In-N-Out that dissapointed. Sadly, that streak is over. Took a lot longer than is usual and food completely lacked flavor. Maybe they ran out of salt? Definitely the most inconsistent In-N-Out I've been to spanning California, Nevada and Utah."}
{"text":"We went during rush hour. Just before 7pm. There was a nice young lady at the end of the drive thru to take our order & give us a total. The wait seemed very short even with 10 cars ahead. And our order was correct down to each detail! The food was hot & delicious!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  The burgers were the thinnest I've had, the fries were thin and no flavor.  I had heard a lot about in and out, won't be back."}
{"text":"I haven't been back to this locale in over 5 years, but one thing for sure, consistent!  This is a busy location near the lower 4 corner so expect long lines.  But the staff have a tried and true system as smooth as the cooks produces the moist, tasteful joys of wonderful off the grill.  The double cheese \"broke the mouth\".  It was the same when I first ate here.  The only difference from back then, different faces manning the counter."}
{"text":"Oh Come on! InNOut Burger, I love it. They always seem to get my order right even in the drive threw, I like to go in and wash my hands before I eat my #1 protein style burger."}
{"text":"Fresh fries not frozen.  Fresh toppings delivered daily.  Need I say more? Animal style, shakes and burgers.  Simple yet spot on tasty."}
{"text":"Tasty burgers, shake and fries. Fries weren't hot, just warm."}
{"text":"The usual and familia goodness of this wonderful chain can be found here. Fries are hit and crispy like they should and the burger assembly is good. Though I noticed one the air vent I sat under had a funny looking air freshener..."}
{"text":"The service here is so friendly and super fast. This is one of the best fast food burgers I have ever had. Double Double with onions and fries. Reasonably priced as well. I will definitely visit again in the future."}
{"text":"Please know that this review is off of this experience only... and typically I LOVE  In-n-Out.   I got a double double with cheese... and fries. The hamburger was totally greasy... not in the good way greasy ... just ... GREASY. That is the only thing i could taste.  I couldn't taste cheese... tomato.. onion... letuce... just grease.  the fries made up for it...  It will be awhile before I get a hamburger here...  I would much rather go to Sonic ... and get the old fashioned cheeseburger I love."}
{"text":"I would give it 4.5 stars but it's a 4 star rating. In-N-Out Burger is a very clean place. I went there last Wednesday and I ordered the Double Double with just meat and cheese, a fry, and a chocolate shake. The service was very nice. They welcomed us to their restaurant and that made me excited. They have very good manners. The other person with me had a regular Double Double, a fry, and a lemonade. The was very juicy and tender because the bun was fresh, the meat was tender, and fresh, and once you chew on it, after about 2 bites, this burst of cheese flavor enters your mouth and takes over the whole taste of the burger in a good way. The cheese flavor was very pleasing to my taste buds. The fries were greasy, but there were pretty good, because the flavor of the salt mixed in with the potato was a really enjoyable taste in my mouth. The fries were very crunchy and it tastes like a real potato fry, but it   also tasted like a McDonald's fry. The shake was very rich, and tasty. You can feel that it's real ice cream in your mouth, plus you can really taste the milk in the ice cream shake. I literally couldn't take my mouth off of the straw. It was that good. The only reason this isn't 5 stars, is that it is a little pricy, but it's worth it mostly. It's not Fuddruckers, or Five Guys pricy."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is ok.  That's it, ok. I truly think most people go because they think it's a cool thing to do. Carl's Jr. burger,(the Big Carl) is a far better burger."}
{"text":"In-n-out is the best fast food burgers anywhere.  The custom service is always great and the employees always have a smile on their faces....of course that is what happens when you treat you employees well and pay them a good wage.  If you have never been to an In-n-out you are missing out on the freshest french fries ever, as you enter the drive through you will see huge glass windows where you can see the employees cutting fresh french fries right there.  You can also see how cleanly the staff is and not to mention the immaculate kitchen, of course there is never any doubt as to the cleanliness of an In-n-out...as the floors are practically clean enough to eat off of.  Of course this is a fast food restaurant and not a five star restaurant, however In-n-Out is the \"five star\" of fast food restaurants.    Fast food doesn't get any better or fresher than this.  I moved to North Carolina back in 2010 and when ever I come back to Vegas for a visit, my first stop is an In-n-Out."}
{"text":"I don't get it  no. really.    I. Just. Don't. Get. It.  Alright, so maybe I'm not a hamburger fan - but i am when it's good, prime, juicy, beef (like kobe, for instance).    And the fries?!  O.  M.  G....  D R Y !  That said: the service is very cool.  Top Notch.  Days gone by.  Anyone I have visit from Canada is in awe when I take them here - and I do it serisouly for the service experience - oh, and when I get \"is there a burger place around\"  (G R O A N ......here we go again....)   So, aunite & uncle were happy.  I didn't even touch a fry.  sorry.  GR8 service (as usual) today - Kudos... and high 5 to ya's"}
{"text":"In & out burger is even better than you have heard!!  Let me start by saying I live in Seattle, WA and unfortunately I haven't had the pleasure of eating at one since they are currently only in 5 states. It's so good it almost makes you want to move to Las Vegas. I had heard about them but never investigated further. We were surprised to learn the menu consists of only about 5 items.  Yeh that's right five. Burger, cheeseburger, double burger, fries, shakes, and soda pop pretty much sums it up. The place was crazy busy with a line almost out the door both times we went but it didn't take too long to get our food, maybe 5 minutes. Everything is fresh and never frozen and they cut the fries right there in front of your eyes from fresh potatoes. The burger had a toasted bun and was amazing and the fries were even better and not greasy at all. The total bill for me and my daughter to eat was under $10 bucks. If you go at lunch or dinner expect it to be very busy. I would do just about anything to get a in & out burger in Seattle.  If you don't believe me than maybe the fact that consumer reports rated it as its top fast food burger restaurant will make you a believer. Honestly it was the best food I had in Vegas."}
{"text":"dude.  it's in-n-out burger.    it should be a crime not to have one in your neighborhood.  I really do feel sorry for east coasters when it comes to cheap, fresh, awesome burgers."}
{"text":"Great location, quick service, decent burgers. This is a good go to for a fast burger and shake. Was here on Friday afternoon. It is usually busy at this location so  a bit of a line but they have so many employees it goes very fast still. I got a double double, fries and a vanilla shake. I am personally not a fan of the secret menu animal style options since I am not a big pickle or mustard fan, but hear it's amazing for those that are. Quality of food seems great for a fast food place. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing place the burgers a soo delicious, i can't wait till the one on camelback opens it'll be closer to my home , I just love a good burger and when I go to this place they always deliver, the staff is so helpful and friendly and most important respectful to an old lady like my self i just love it"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and puts other fast food joints to shame. They are on point, on time, hot fresh food and everyone is always smiling. I love how fast they get the line down but don't sacrifice the integrity of the meal or the experience for that matter. Thank you for keeping alive the American Dream and delivering a consistent, fast meal and service. You rock and I will continue to take the out of towers and snowbirds to your place as much as possible. Best fast food restaurant in North Phoenix.  Thanks Nick"}
{"text":"Extremely slow service for being in n out. Found more than one hair in my fries and they looked old as fuck lol"}
{"text":"As Californian stranded in the desert, this is the only fast food place I would trust.  Always clean, friendly personal, quality is all there..."}
{"text":"Burger Heaven for a not so burger person.  Don't let the line scare you, it moves quick.  I get the fries and burger animlized and its O SOOOOO yummy.    I go several times while in Vegas soon as I get off the plane , a couple times while there and I make sure to hit it once more before I leave out for the airport.  I crave it when I get home to Indiana so much.  There are several In & Outs to choose from around Vegas but the one on Dean Martin is my favorite because its so busy and all the hussle and bussle of the people.  Plus you know everything is fresh because they are making so much nothing is sitting around.  5+ stars all the way."}
{"text":"A classic burger joint that keeps it simple, In-n-Out has a very charming appeal to diners of all types.  They seem to be sticking to what they know best, yet it's apparent that they have adapted over the years to perfect their offerings. Burgers, fries, and shakes is what's on the menu. Using their ingredients, you can pretty much make any variation you want and fully customize your meal.  The secret menu isn't so secret, as it's basically a manual for how to customize the experience to your liking. I truly appreciate an establishment's willingness to cater to the customer. I myself am a vegetarian, and I look forward to the few times a year that I come across an In-n-Out.  Grill Chz w chilies X chilies X toast & FF Well. To me, that's worth returning. (Plus it doesn't hurt that it totals to $4.00 even, talk about a good deal for veggies)"}
{"text":"In-N-Out is probably one of the most consistent fast food joints, no matter what location you go to, they are all good!  Everything I have ever gotten here has been good.  The protein style burger is great, and only has 240 calories, and taste just as great as a regular burger!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but lately its just too greasy for my liking, plus, the fries seem to always be under-cooked :("}
{"text":"This place is always busy. I don't get it.  The burger is plain. The fries are plain. No pizazz, no spice, no unique flavors, nada.  Eating here is the theoretical equivalent of going to a Dairy Queen where the only thing on the menu is a vanilla cone."}
{"text":"I don't get the draw for this place.  I ordered the double cheese burger and cheese fries.  The burger was overcooked, had too much onion on it, and overall was very runny.    I will call the fries \"fry chips.\"  Most of the fries in the bowl were teeny, tiny pieces with about a dozen actual fries mixed in.  The cheese on top was kinda bland.  All this being said, this place was packed.  It takes some time to get your food so be prepared to wait.  Everyone seemed to have a good time and enjoy their meal.  When I think of Gormet Burgers I think of the restaurants at the Burg (St. Petersburg) or many of the fine restaurants in the Midwest.  I just did not find this burger up to that level.    The thing with this place is I was starving.  I had not eaten for 18 hours.  Anything should have tasted good.  I really wished I had gone somewhere else.  Maybe I had an off meal, but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Sorry, i know californians tend to love this place, much due to the historical factor of it, but to me it was just a bad version of a burguer king. I really wanted to like this, but even in my country i had better sandwiches...total dissapointment"}
{"text":"My favorite In-N-Out location by far!! The associates are extremely friendly and my cheeseburger always turns out correct and extremely delicious."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love IN n Out?! Best burger joint! There's just a couple of things I have to point out though...  1. It gets pretty over crowded during the day with students from UNLV   2. If you are driving, PLEASE be very careful with the slight traffic and students passing.   Other than that, worth the wait to get a juicy burger, fries, and a delicious milkshake!"}
{"text":"It's your average burger place. It was way too crowded and the best thing about it is that you can out \"animal style\" on your burger."}
{"text":"The food is good and the service is awesome. I'll sometimes ride my bike to this location. They've made my food perfect every time."}
{"text":"I went to in-n-out burger on 27th Avenue Peoria and had the worst experience I've ever had at one of their locations my burger was not only sloppy but the lady that taking the order at the drive thru window was very rude and obnoxious and made me very angry I would never go back or recommend any of my friends to go there to that location ever."}
{"text":"Always a good time at in-and-out!  It's a must visit whenever I'm in Vegas.  My friends and I would always cab out to get in-and-out and have the driver wait for us.  It's totally worth every meter money!  Haha.  Delicious burger at a unbeatable price!  Fresh ingredients that you can taste.  My favorite is the animal style. Don't forget to lookup their secret menu before you head over."}
{"text":"Oh can't get enough! Wish they had this in Denver. I love the animal style burgers with cheese and grilled onion fries! Get the Neapolitan shake - it's part of their secret menu and it is perfection!"}
{"text":"Burger was good as always, but the fries were a poor effort"}
{"text":"Man oh man, being someone who's originally from California, and growing up in this place to know that they had In m Out here struck a cord in my heart! This place is awesome and blows away any other fast food burger place by far! Trust me if you take a drive to this location you will easily have to wait to be served which is a good thing. There's a reason the parking lot and the drive through is always packed! In n Out will continue to be a staple for me and my family! I highly recommend from there secret menu, the 4x4.. If you are an extreme burger guy like me you will love this one plus it's how I'm able to stay looking good in the gym with all that protein and special sauce I get in my system floating around! Again the location stays busy so pick your battle but you will leave happy that's forsure! The fries.. Gotta love them.. With extra sauce. Just ask them for extra special sauce and use it as a dip. You can thank me later :)"}
{"text":"Never disappointed! . This place knows how to rock the burgers. .I love it animal style. ..and the fresh cut French fries are delish...."}
{"text":"Love the burgers but hate the fries. What more can Only say? It is what it is... I wish they used real potatoes that don't taste like you are eating a towel."}
{"text":"I'm from the Midwest.  We don't have this restaurant where I live.  So, anytime on on the west side of the US - I look for an In-N-Out Burger.  It's the best fast food burger I've had.  Prices are reasonable as well. Make it animal style if you have heartburn medicine."}
{"text":"In-N-Out always hits the spot. The drive thru is long especially on weekends but then again, what In-N-Out isn't? The fries aren't as good as Mcdonalds though."}
{"text":"Hamburger and fries for $4 incl tax.  What a deal!  Portions were generous.  Burger and fries were very tasty.  Restaurant was busy but got my order within 10 min.  I can see why everyone raves about this place."}
{"text":"My entire family ate lunch here, and we ALL got sick after. So if you like paying money to get food poisoning, then this is the right place. I will NOT be returning to this place. ever."}
{"text":"Food is good! It's a bit of a wait but the good is always fresh. I'm not much of a burger person, but I love their burgers and the fries are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Every time I go here the wait is 30min drive through. Should be called \"In and Wait\" idk these people are doing because every-time there's a full staff. There are plenty of better burger joints to go to for a quicker wait and better quality burger"}
{"text":"Great customer service!  Employees are friendly and helpful.  Hamburger and fries are always freshly made.  You can't beat the late night hours for a night time craving!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this franchise.. this specific location has  mishandled my order on more occasions then not.... So disappointing, all they have to do is slow down and listen to the order it's not that complicated... so sad"}
{"text":"In the Northeast we're completely deprived of delicious Double-Doubles, and while there are still options for good burgers up here, their absence is noted. There is simply no other burger quite like an In-N-Out burger.  There's nothing I can say that hasn't been said by many before me. In-N-Out is legend, and justifiably so. Whether or not there are comparable burgers out there is irrelevant, because they're not In-N-Out burgers, which have a unique taste all their own.   The Chandler Boulevard location is the only In-N-Out I've been to, frequently when I lived in Arizona, now much less that I'm in Massachusetts. It's clean and nails all the characteristics one would expect, and offers the pure deliciousness that the Western U.S. covets.  It's an In-N-Out, and that's really all that matters, isn't it?"}
{"text":"Good. Fun. Great service for fast food. Not in my top 10 for burger joints."}
{"text":"Customer service was great, MY food was great, but my experience was ruined when my wife bit into her burger and found a long black hair in the middle of it."}
{"text":"Stopped there yesterday. I am seriously handicapped with oxygen and back surgery, All the Handicapped parking was taken up by TAXI CABS. waved my placard at 1 driver and he just stood by his cab. Called the Taxi authority and they were not really to interested. If I see this again you know I will be taking pictures. I was so angry I forgot to take photos. Needless to say there was no other parking either. Taxis own this city. I couldn't count how many cabs were there."}
{"text":"Always a treat to stop here, look forward to the number one combo any time I'm on the west coast. The way burgers and fries should be served. No so fast, but always fresh and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Yummmo great burgers what can I say want a good no great burger go here for one you will be hooked"}
{"text":"Every dim wit wannabe is trying to copy their business model and can't seem to get it right.   Great food, spotless environment and unmatched value.    GoR is a Pig"}
{"text":"Great staff with the exception of 1 little lady who can't seem to key in the orders unless it's given to her in the order SHE wants.  Strange how no other cashiers have problems inputting orders.  She obviously didn't pay attention during her customer interface skills training.    The food is great and we always go to this location as it's the closest to us, even though it's 8+ miles away.  They forget the side of pickles fairly often but I always look for them before walking away from the counter.    Noticed complaints about the fries and this is my only gripe with ALL In-N-Outs.  They cut their fries with the potato horizontal (you can watch them do it) so that they're all too tiny.  It's probably a safety issue as it is harder to cut potatoes vertically.  There's just wayyyyy to many teeny tiny fries in every order.  I also watch my order and if the fries are sitting up there waiting for the rest of my order, they're going back and I'll ask for fresh, HOT fries.  Regardless of the size, fries SUCK when they're not hot.    This location could save a TON of money by not having the AC cranked down so cold.  You can actually hear people complain and move from table to table trying to find one that's not freezing.  It also makes the food cold so quickly.  I know the workers get hot in the back, but it's ridiculous that they freeze out all of their patrons who are trying to enjoy a HOT meal.    They're supposed to be opening a location in the Queen Creek Marketplace which would be a lot closer for all the SE Gilbert and QC folks.  Come on . . . get the QC location built now!"}
{"text":"Fast service , good employees, clean environment, can't ask for any more   Team animal fries all the way"}
{"text":"Good service. Good burgers. Good milk shakes. Fries are O.K. wish they were better. Food is priced appropriately."}
{"text":"They have the best burgers of anyone. Also best in and out I've ever eaten at in the las Vegas area. And their fries to go along with the shakes. Yummm."}
{"text":"IN N OUT cheeseburgers are the best. It does not matter which location you go to; the food is very tasty. The fries...don't let them get cold or it won't be as good."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed In-N-out before?! I loves me a double double with grilled onions. The fries are also a favorite. Perfect with a little ketchup, and when I'm feeling sinful I'll get the fries animal style without the sauce (I find it's a soggy mess with it), with the grilled onions it takes cheese fries to a whole new level.  When they built this location I was so stoked because it was close to home. I was also afraid it might induce a heart attack, but so far so good. I am able to show incredible restraint, except when I catch the wafting scent of those glorious grilled onions."}
{"text":"One word AMAZING!!! I loved the look of the place, very traditional fast food, the staff were very friendly. I had a number two on the menu which was a cheese burger and fries and it speaks volumes about how amazing this place is, the chips tasted so crispy and fresh while the burger was just incredible and everything in the burger was so nice and you could easily tell its fresh. I'm from the UK and anyone who comes to Las Vegas should come here, money wise as well it's well with the visit it was $6 and well worth it."}
{"text":"This place is over-hyped to the extreme. When I was in Vegas, I decided to stop there because I have never had In and Out before.   The prices are fair. The menu is boring. The service, even when no one is in the line with you, takes forever. My group went there twice.   The burger was decent. It was not great. It tasted just like a Wendy's burger, just slightly more fresh.  The fries, both times I got them, were bland. Basically tasteless, except for the taste of oil . I would never order those fries again. They are boring. The rest of the people with me got my fries after about the third one I tried. Maybe I should have had a few drinks at the hotel before I tried them, but sober, they are just horrible.   It gets more than one star because you can customize and they actually listen. The sauce is pretty tasty. Other than that, I didn't see anything remarkable about it. I just like a place that actually listens to your order.   It's fast food. It tastes like fast food. When it comes to fast food, it has some of the worst fries I have ever had. The bun is standard. The meat is standard. The sauce and vegetables being fresh and tasty was what makes it just slightly better.   If you go there, just think fresh tasting Wendy's and you will not be disappointed. Skip on the fries or get tons of ketchup and salt to make up for the lack of any flavor."}
{"text":"The double double is my favorite burger. The fresh cut fries are awesome. The staff is always on their game and very friendly."}
{"text":"In n Out is my favorite fast food joint. I go to the one on Stapley and the 60 regularly with no issues. I had never had food from this location until today. Overall it was okay as usual, but the only problem I had was the meat being undercooked. It wasn't a HUGE issue with me, however I can see how it could be with others. So here's your warning fellow Yelp homies."}
{"text":"Grilled cheese,chili fries,Dr. Pepper,vanilla shake--Totally worth the pounds you gain afterward"}
{"text":"PRICE - You cant beat the prices at In n Out. Anywhere else you go, you will spend $6 for just the burger. Here at In n Out you get the whole meal.  STAFF - They are always friendly and seem to be in a good mood. They definitely show great teamwork on preparing our food.  FOOD - One word, DELICIOUS!!! everything is always fresh and made when you order. The portions are good too. This is not on the menu but ask for animal style fries or burgers. I'm getting hungry just writing this review."}
{"text":"I've know about In n Out burgers for such a long time, so when I saw one during my first trip to the united stated I wasted no time in making my way over there!   The place is always busy with people queueing up to order there burgers, while orders are being shouted out for pickup. I order the number 1, which is double pattie, double cheese, along with the secret menu option Animal Style, which gives you grilled onions!  After a few minutes wait while filling up my coke cup, I picked up the tray which had the fries and burger on it. The first thing I noticed was the way in which the burger was wrapped in paper keeping everything together. A very nice touch to keeping everything in one place and not falling out. The taste was very good! The fries were crispy and fresh. A truly delicious burger that was warmly welcomed after getting off a flight from London.  I'm not a huge fan of the highly processed white bread they use for burgers in America, but when in Rome!  Probably my favourite of all the American fast food burger offerings!"}
{"text":"The Best!!! Makes you forget that Macdonalds even exist. Reminded me of what fast food hamburgers and fries tasted as a kid. Oh and they have Coca-Cola, need I say more."}
{"text":"There foods good but good luck getting in and out as this place is non stop always busy. This place started the always made fresh when you order policy and that's the key to making fast food that tastes good. There are other places with better burgers but in and out is a must try."}
{"text":"I eat... (used to eat as of now)  In n out on a daily basis. Their burgers are delicious, never frozen and all the fresh sides you could ever want. My last two burgers were plain and terrible. If you ask for a side, be sure to say it over and over again. And then make sure they repeat it back to you. Otherwise you end up like me; without any lettuce or tomato in sight. Man. In N Out once had my heart. In the last 5 years the delicious family-run company has turned from a place you could trust for a perfect burger to a corporation feeling establishment. One star is for the broken heart I have....so sad to see INO's essential death....its the new McDonald's."}
{"text":"So tempting to stop by late at night. Open til 1am."}
{"text":"They make an in-n-out burger as good as they do in all the other in-n-outs, so I have no complaints. The four stars instead of five is just because the service was okay, not exceptional."}
{"text":"I love the burgers and fries from here. I left the drive thru without my fries and contacted the phone number on the receipt, the customer service was out of this world. They even followed up with a call to see how my recent experience went. Customer for life!!"}
{"text":"Of course I feel like a freak being one of the few people to give this place less than 4 stars, however, I just don't see what the big deal is. Limited menu is some how elitist? What? Since when is that fashionable? What am I not seeing here? Apparently there is special lingo, and \"in the loop\" type service. How is that a good business practice and how can people play into this charade willingly? I just don't get it.  Bad, dry burgers, limp fries, limited menu, and hipster air. And I've been to different In-N-Out Burgers, all the same. Don't get it, I don't recommend."}
{"text":"I have been to this location more than once and it is consistent with any other In n Out experience. Everyone working is always really nice and enthusiastic and the food is always perfect and hot. It's a shame this In n Out isn't located on the strip."}
{"text":"Whats there to say?! Always in he mood for an animal. Tastes great at every location."}
{"text":"Service: We drove off strip to avoid the zoo nearby the strip. I would rather make the drive than fight for a table and sit in a noisy restaurant. This location delivered. At 2pm on a Tuesday, the drive through line was about 2-3 cars and inside there was only about 3-4 people in front of us. No problems ordering or finding a seat. I am glad we ventured out to this location.   Ambiance: Typical cookie cutter location, which is perfectly fine. There was plenty of parking in the shared shopping center and it was easy to access from the freeway. Nice.   Food: Double double animal style - perfect. I love the extra veggies and pickles and how wet the burger is. Double double w/ raw onion - excellent. Loved the flavor of the raw onions. Was a little dry in comparison to the animal style. Maybe I should get animal style with raw onions?! Animal fries - delicious as always.  To escape the crazies, come to this location. It is worth the drive."}
{"text":"My burger was horrible. I have been to the desert ridge - multiple times. I will not come back ."}
{"text":"Usually, I'm very fond of In n Out and the quality of their food, but today quite the opposite. Me and my wife, soon to be, attended this chandler location late Saturday night after a long day. We order two number twos, WITHOUT onions, an ice tea and a lemonade. First things first, as we bit into our burgers... we noticed to our despair they both had onions! Now this is already pretty unacceptable by In n outs standards, but I decided to give the a break. Next, their fries, which are normally perfect, were well over done and basically inedible. Furiously, I took a great swig from my Ice tea only to realize it was utterly horrendous. HOW THE FUCK DO YOU MESS UP ICE TEA! There was absolutely no sugar or taste for that matter, as it was so fucking watered down that I had to throw it out my window. 1 star. Never again. Disappointed, fix your self In n Out."}
{"text":"The In-N-Out burger closest to the strip is jam packed. But worth the wait...You can't walk there but its a quick taxi ride from the strip, and highly, highly worth the trip."}
{"text":"I don't eat beef, so the clerk gave me a veggie burger. It's good tho."}
{"text":"I love In N Out. I'm a So Cal born & raised. Every location in Las Vegas has been grate to me. But this location is the worst I've been to. The staff is awsome, that is not the issue. Never in 30 years have I had an In N Out bun fall apart while eating it, today it happened. I can get over that.  But the fries are always over cooked. Last week the were burnt & unedible. I think they just need to clean out the fryer or get a new one. Sorry In N Out, I still love you."}
{"text":"Some of my biggest arguments with friends Are about the haterade that they display for  InNOut the best burger spot in Vegas  Bar none  Not loving InNOut is like saying the movie the Godfather is lame  Do you have a right say it ?..Sure  are you wrong? ..Of course  Fries are not that good Shakes are a must"}
{"text":"Aside from the nasty smell of Charleston and Nellis area... You can never go wrong with In-n-Out!!!"}
{"text":"Solid - basics, basics, basics. Nuthin but burgers and fries- its a winner, not exactly Shake Shack, but definately hits the spot."}
{"text":"I came through the drive through late last night before hopping on the freeway to head home.   It was about 12:50am when I placed my order, #1 no onions with lemonade. Exactly 5 minutes later I received my order in an 'eat in your car' form.   I've always known this chain of places to be very consistent no matter where I go. I'm 100% sure I will return sometime soon."}
{"text":"The food and service here can not be matched, my only problem with this place is their parking lot.  It is poorly designed and can only be accessed on 83rd avenue.  If their parking lot connected to the rest of the shopping center it would allow for better flow of traffic.  Prices and quality of food though are an A+"}
{"text":"Best place to get a protein burger and vanilla shake. The staff is always friendly but today our cashier Madison went above and beyond when my son was being cranky while I was trying  to order. She gave him stickers and a hat. Thanks for helping to calm him down."}
{"text":"Fantastic fast food. The fries are freshly sliced when you order them and not too salty.  But it's the secret menu burgers that make it so hard to live so far from an In-N-Out Burger.  Order a Double Double, Animal style and you'll understand why these are my favorite fast food burgers.  I miss In-N-Out with a passion."}
{"text":"I saw a huge drive-thru line and was scared that the line inside would be also long. Fortunately, it wasn't. Food and service were perfect as always."}
{"text":"I am docking this location 2 stars in the hope that somebody in control of this place sees this and takes to heart the severity of the problem here. The drive-thru is an absolute nightmare! These guys have got to fix the cluster f*** in that parking lot. Block off access to the shopping center, so that the ridiculous line of cars stops creating an all day traffic jam."}
{"text":"What can I say that I haven't already said about you?  I have visited this location on my visit last year, as well as this year. I've found them to be everything I've come to expect from this chain. The staff is cheerful and energetic. They work hard and move fast. The food is up to standards. Large outdoor seating area. Easy access with stoplight that allows you to get in and out (!!!) going east or west. Try anything off the secret menu. (I mean you--protein style!!)"}
{"text":"Still the best and always will be.  burgers are carfully made and are the way it should be made. the milk shakes are heavenly and are the best around.  fries are also unbeatable.  this is \"fast food' heaven.  if your on the west coast you cant pass up In-N-Out!"}
{"text":"If this were on the strip, it would have the longest line in town.  Solid for lunch, dinner, and late-night."}
{"text":"I love in n out but coincidentally in n out does not love me back. I'll keep this short and sweet. The staff is awesome they're all very friendly especially when it's busy and the line moves at a decent pace but the last 3 times I've eaten here over the course of 5 months I've gotten food poisoning every time. Last night was THE WORST. projectile vomiting my 3x3 protein style. chills. and heart burn to top it off. maybe in the rush they aren't cooking the meat all the way? not sure. but I can't let myself eat here again. sorry in n out. Love ya anyway tho"}
{"text":"Customer service here is amazing! Asked Normandi for a water cup and instead of giving me a cup and walking away she filled it up, capped it and put a straw in it, thats how you get return customers like that. Simple things."}
{"text":"The famous In and Out Burger!  This is a must stop establishment when in Las Vegas  remember to \"animal\" your fries  This in and out burger joint is always busy. The line ups are crazy but the staff are great and keep everyone moving threw the lineups fast"}
{"text":"Okay, so would the world hate me if I said that I thought In-N-Out Burger was just okay?? Well there, I said it. Hate away.   I haven't been to an In-N-Out since I was a teenager. It's also been a good 5 or so years since I've pretty much stopped eating fast food. With that being said, the bathing suit portion of my trip was over so I was a little excited to indulge a little.    There was a line wrapped around the building but it didn't take more than 5 minutes to order. It probably took about 15 minutes to actually get our food. I had requested the animal sauce on the side, however they put it on my double-double anyways. I was not waiting for them to fix their mistake so just took it. I also got an order of fries.   So it tasted like a fast food burger. I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it. I absolutely did. I just didn't have that east coast girl meets west coast burger euphoric experience. Although to be honest, I didn't love the animal sauce. A little too creamy/mayo-like for me. I would have preferred if my burger wasn't smothered in it.   Big plus: it was probably the food I ate all weekend that wasn't overpriced.   I'm glad I did it, but I'll probably be sticking to local cuisine next time I cross paths with an In-N-Out."}
{"text":"This location is an example of a fine tuned restaurant establishment. Although the restaurant was full, the orders came out fast, good and hot. The orders were taken efficiently and with a smile. After ordering a meal and enjoying it i went back to order a chocolate shake. As soon as i said the word shake, i was given one. The shake was just right for the extra large straw it came with. Now that is fast service. An employee also came and checked on us while we were eating. Just like all restaurants should.  Keep up the excellent work."}
{"text":"Totally unimpressed it was Sat. afternoon my wife had an urge for In-N-Out, the closest one was Tempe,location. Burgers were dry, bun was dry and the fries even though I know they are hand cut fresh are still not as good as McDonalds. I won't be back soon for a Double double."}
{"text":"Best fast food joint around for the price.  Forget about Ronald McDonald and The King."}
{"text":"In-N-Out Burger is simply the best hamburger in Las Vegas, and there malts are the perfect match for a special dinning experience."}
{"text":"Does one need to even write a review for In-N-Out?  The value can't be beat- the burgers are delicious (especially Animal Style), the fries are so light I have to stop from inhaling them, and the shakes are the perfect consistency and size.  My only complaint is that they are not in Chicago!"}
{"text":"We at here on St. Patty's for lunch.  It was very busy, but service was fast.  The place had several  people cleaning too.   I don't drink soda pop, so light lemonade was a great option.  The burger was fresh and made correctly."}
{"text":"It is In-N-Out, so you should know what you are getting.  Company store is across the parking lot for you merchandise needs.  Fairly small location, given how busy it is."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location. Ordered a double double animal style. Excellent as always...until I was down to one of the last few bites and found a curly black pubic hair. Yikes. #hashtagfacebookinstagramnevercomingbackhereagain. Fries were average, that hasn't changed."}
{"text":"I find the food satisfied and we'll prepared . The animal fries are my favorite fresh cut and the spread is delicious. Customer service is great."}
{"text":"Went late night on a weekend, it was packed with kids who had been out clubbing, cab drivers coming off of their shift, some various locals and a handful of (like me) tourists.  It could have been cleaner and it could have been faster, but who's really complaining? Burger, fries and a milkshake at In-N-Out Burger...it should be part of everyone's Las Vegas adventure."}
{"text":"I travel the world and to date, In-N-Out still has my the BEST burgers out there! Always really busy but great customer service. Ask for animal-style fries and you have yourself one great hangover remedy."}
{"text":"First time trying the restaurant. Went through the drive thru. Person taking order and collecting the money was very personable. Food was great for the price.   I even like how they ask if you want a placemat if you eat in the car."}
{"text":"All around a great burger. Veggies are crisp and fresh. The burger patties are done but not dried out. They have a nice flavor too. The burger doesn't come the way I like it but they are very accommodating when I ask for it my way. Staff is friendly and the place is clean, modern and has a nice atmosphere.  Always busy it seems, but you still get your order quick and hot. I like the fries better at McD's but the burgers are great!  One of the best burgers in town."}
{"text":"Can't be the double double. Always good food.  Quality every time. Fresh and tastes like real food. Like the shakes also."}
{"text":"Very good food. They are not kidding when they say it's quality you can taste! I come here at least once a month if not more. Staff is nice and tables are clean.  Don't Kidd yourself, they are the best around."}
{"text":"If fast food places were steaks, In & Out would be a Filet Mignon....ok maybe that's TOO much of an exaggeration on how good their burgers are but you get the idea.  This place does get super packed but the line looks worse than it actually is.  Since it's behind the Strip and right off the Tropicana exit on I15, what do you expect?  Even though they are busy pretty much non stop all day, the workers there are very efficient in getting orders down and filled.  I've waited no longer than 15 minutes in line to place my order and even less time for my order to get filled.  Kudos to them as they work very hard to make sure everyone gets what they ordered.  The wait is worth it by far.   A double double with cheese fries and a chocolate shake tastes good at any hour."}
{"text":"A great place for a quick, filling burger! I haven't been to one since I moved to New Mexico (outside of trips back to Cali) and introduced my friend to it the minute I saw it across the way. Crowded but pleasant, and quick with service, it has great fries, good people, and great burgers! Please oh please, make your way to New Mexico!"}
{"text":"I wish they had in-n-outs in Virginia. We almost missed our flight back from Vegas but had to stop by on the way to the airport. The strawberry shake was very good. I got the double double. Very fulfilling. The jalapeños are really spicy. I think the pricing is pretty good. And the line moved pretty fast at this location."}
{"text":"This is my favorite In-N-Out and the first one I ever visited.   It has the basic In-N-Out food. BUT...every. single. time. I come here everything is delicious. The fries are cooked to perfection, the burgers done perfectly, the service is snappy even when busy, and the shakes are creamy, delicious, and perfectly mixed.   Every time I'm in Vegas I have to eat at this In-N-Out, it just wouldn't be a trip to Vegas without it. They all should be this good."}
{"text":"This was a first time at In-N-Out Burger and it was just as great as I had heard. Make sure to look up their secret menu online to really take advantage of what they have to offer. The prices are good and the food is way better than McDonalds and other fast food."}
{"text":"Best burger in town!!! I love how all the in n outs I've gone too have awesome service and delicious burgers and fries!! Quick service and everything tastes fresh!"}
{"text":"This is a smaller location although the drive thru line moved really slow but yet I receive the smallest animal fry known to man I'm not angry just dissapoint and won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Request well done burgers. Getting rare-med burgers. Third incident this week. Come on now. If I want \"bloody rare\", I would request it. I request well-done without pink. Just leave it on the grill for a couple of more minutes. I know you guys get swamp during dinner rush...but my GF and I dont like rare burgers...  Medium-rare steak is fine (not my preference..but still semi-safe). Burgers are never fine.E-coli anyone?  Contacted the central guest service number. They are trying to correct the issues now.  I love IN-N-Out when my order is correct and my burger is cook properly......  3rd occurrence this week. =-( I didnt realize until the burger was half eaten. GF pointed it out.. The rest went into the garbage. I hope I dont die tonight.  I guess \"Animal Style\" burger takes on a whole new meaning.   At least they got the fries correct. Well-done fries...."}
{"text":"Great food. Quality ingredients. Simple menu. Their fries are kinda bland unless you do them animal style. The place is always busy! I wish there was easier access into this location too."}
{"text":"This place needs about negative 20 stars. I lived in California before they moved out here. Coming back to Arizona I thought I was safe from the insanity these locations caused. I swear I'm in a Fringe (or X-files, for the older Yelpers) episode. I had a co-worker who made a trip to LA and said one of the reasons was to get a burger from here. I asked him to stop taking the drugs. Plain and simple: the tasteless patties on every burger have the consistency of sun-dried cow patties and sadly they may be the best thing on the menu. Oh and I have a burger like, once a year, since my sister insists that I give it a try since she loves it. Don't worry I make sure she takes her pills."}
{"text":"Great service and food every time I've come in here. This crew works fast!   I always have complicated burgers to order and for the most part they get it right every time. When they don't, it's no biggie, I'm just not the biggest fan of the spread.   Inside is always clean and things like kids and napkins are always kept stocked and in order. This is my go-to for a quick, delicious burger."}
{"text":"love the in-n-out.  fast service, consistently good burgers, fries and milkshake are good prices."}
{"text":"I love stopping here. Fresh burgers from never frozen meat on top of award winning service. The limited menu helps them keep their focus on the freshness of the meal. This place is always busy, but they still get you in and out quickly."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers made fresh with each order.  Fast and efficient service. Very busy, but little waiting.  Has a drive in service.  The restaurant is kept very clean...which i really appreciate!   They also have tables outside &plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Busy, busy, busy but they move people through like champs. It was worth the wait and considering the line, which was out the door, it wasn't as long as I thought. Best burger on the strip."}
{"text":"What's not to love? Clean, fast, yummy, and doesn't taste like it's liquifying your insides."}
{"text":"Amazing location.  It is right off the freeway near the Galleria Mall and the Walmart for those who like to shop.  The drive thru can be very busy but don't despair, it is fast hence the in and out... Or so I think.  Look at the bottom of your drink cup.  There is a biblical verse which is cool for those who read the Bible.  I guess there is a little bit of something for everyone.  Great burgers and fries.  Animal style your orders and you'll love it."}
{"text":"Being from the East coast we were determined to have In n Out burger while in Vegas, and it did not disappoint. Staff is very friendly as well. Yum!"}
{"text":"Is it worth all the hype?  No I would not make a 500 mile road-trip just to go but it's good.  The burgers and fries are made while you wait exactly as you want them.  The shakes are really good and the staff is really friendly and fast.  The prices are very reasonable and I would recommend it if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Last weekend I went to In-N-Out burger. I have heard rumors that this local burger joint was delightful. My team and I walked into it with high expectations. While I was standing in line, I took great observation of my surroundings. I noticed a few details that I wasn't very fond of. First of all, the menu only had three burgers that you could order. Altogether the menu only contained a total of around 10 items. I looked thoroughly at the menu and chose my order. I ordered the Double-Double with a vanilla milkshake. Since my whole soccer team of 18 people ordered, it took a long time to get our food. While I was waiting for my food my friends were telling me about how great the food was. When I got my order, it looked like any other burger. When I sat down and took my first bite, it tingled my taste buds and definitely lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"In n out in every great fast food place it better then all the others places. They serve food fast and the prices are also pretty cheap"}
{"text":"I have eaten In-N-Out Burgers several times, but fail to see the almost cult-like following. Don't get me wrong, every burger has been well made, tasty, with fresh ingredients. If in the mood for a burger and an In-N-Out is nearby, I will stop in and grab some quick grub.  But this is not the best burger in the known Universe by a long shot.  My less than informed guess as to the fascination is because of three key reasons: (1) So many people have fond memories of eating In-N-Out as a child; (2) The \"secret\" menu and ordering makes many feel like they are privy to a secret society; (3) Those on the east coast have often only heard of this chain restaurant through office conversation, and through legends passed down by elders at night by the fire.  Oh, there might be a fourth reason; many think it is a good burger, but are afraid to take on In-N-Out fanatics by suggesting there are other equally good burgers available to our civilized society.  Now, while the burgers are fresh and good, the french fries (not animal fries or some other version) are boring and in my opinion as a three generation french fry expert are not very good."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is incredible. If you have not ever been here, you need to go! They have yummy fries and burgers. If your vegetarian, they have a burger for that. Also, be sure to ask about their \"Secret Menu\" - I like Animal Style fries."}
{"text":"Hands down the absolute BEST fast food burger I have ever had! I don't eat fast food really to speak of, but let me tell you this place should make five guys close! The fries were friggin awesome and the burger was great! Words can not describe it! Not to mention at 10:30am the line was wrapped around the whole building inside and out! It was very quick service too!"}
{"text":"HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS HEAVEN ON EARTH OF A PLACE!!!  I don't even know where to start! I am so grateful to have grown up on the west side. I could talk about this place all day errdayy, but I won't. Service is ALWAYS top notch and when I say always I mean EVERY FREAKIN TIME. Double double with animal fries is the way to go, but you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu! WEST COAST FTW"}
{"text":"Extremely slow drive thru. Like what are you doing?? Why does it always take FOREVER to get a $3 burger, you have like 5 items, you can't make them quickly?? Other places have like 20-30 options and they crank cars through."}
{"text":"I often come here at night when it seems like everyone else is craving a late meal, but regardless of what time or whether it's in restaurant vs drive thru the service is always quick with the food tasting great."}
{"text":"We love In-n-Out we live in LA and are always there and we are used to get great food and great service. Food was great but their service needs some work. Evan the guy who took our order was rude and kept rushing us when we had 5 orders. He would shut off his headset after every order thinking we were done when we said we had a large order. Then we get up to the window and he try's to short us a fry that we paid for and showed our receipt. We work in retail and customer service and we were just very sad to see that they could just brush us off. He needs some serious customer service training. Very Disappointed."}
{"text":"The best burgers anywhere, The food speaks for itself. The fries are frsh cut and the service rocks. I don't just want in-n-out, I need it. What a great burger."}
{"text":"I do love IN-N-Out a lot and will always do but this IN-N-Out location has some issues with details. I once had hair in my fries when I ordered at the drive-through and also the fires where stacked on top of each other in the bag, they're supposed to be tissues on top of the fries and then stacked on top of each other, so when I grab the fries in the bag, they're all messed up inside the bag, they also provided me with a little larger portion of fries too. They've also screwed up my orders a couple of times. I once said yes to onions but didn't get onions but good thing when I said no dressing, they put no dressing. But other than that the food tastes great like any other IN-N-Out but I don't get why these small details are missing. My brother used to work at an IN-N-Out and he was amazed how such small details are being missed. I guess the manager isn't doing their job right at this location so I don't know what is going on. I have gone two times in the span of about 3 months and the issues still persisted. I know they're small details but restaurants need to have consistency and consistency shouldn't be hard for a place that has so little menu items."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love In-N-Out? The burgers are fresh and seasoned well. The bun, which is very important to a good burger, tastes great with the right crispiness along the edges. And they don't try to get overly creative with their burgers that can come with a big slice of onion, crisp piece of lettuce, freshly sliced tomato, which I avoid, and nice crunchy pickles. Other burger places try to do too much and just ruin it to the point where you can't taste the burger. Not In-N-Out. They keep it simple just like their menu. Why make things so complicated when it comes to food. To top it off, their  burgers are cheap. I don't know why I keep for searching for the perfect burger when it's right here at In-N-Out. The only thing I don't like are the long lines, but that's the trade off for a place that's so popular and freshly makes its burgers."}
{"text":"Wow i havent had in & out in like 4 years.  And i am in love with them again!  Nothing has changed, their simple but delicious food and amazing quick and friendly service!  Those strawberry shakes are sooooo good"}
{"text":"We land at the airport after noon and get a cab or a limo and head out. Were hungry... We have one place in mind before we start dining at the resort restaurants, In and Out Burgers.  We ask the driver would he mind swinging thru ? We have never had one turn us down when we offer to buy.  The burgers are very fresh , the fries......ahhh the fries.  We prefer drive thru. The wait and organized confusion inside are not a good way to start a vacation, we save that for the clubs.   Just ask your cabbie or driver to take you to In and Out and they will smile and say sure, I was just thinking about lunch too !"}
{"text":"What can you say!  One of the best burgers around, fast service and friendly employees. Last time I went in for lunch about 1:30pm the place was packed, and it is because the food is simply delicious. Double double with fries. Yum"}
{"text":"I have eaten in several In-N-Out Burger joints and this one seems to consistently be the best.  A bit hard to get into this parking lot, but worth the effort.  The favorite in our group is always the double-double combo.  I eat a single, so I am always the odd one.  Get a single and a vanilla shake.  Then score a few fries from your wife or girlfriend.  There are enough."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love In-n-out. Simple menu, yummy burgers and their shakes are good too. I get the same thing every time and never had an issue with it. The fries are good but nothing extraordinary. Service is great, no issues"}
{"text":"Great burgers and shakes! The lines are long but the staff works quick. Friendly people and awesome merchandise. Fries could use some work but you can tell they are real potato."}
{"text":"Great service! Drive thru was packed on a Saturday night at 930 pm. The drive thru man was taking order on lap top and walking down the line taking orders quickly and efficiently. He was pleasant and fast and made the wait much more bearable. That kid needs a raise with how gracefully and calmly he handled that crowd. The workers inside were quick to get the orders out so the line that wrapped around and into another parking lot moved along very quickly. Our food was hot and perfect. My husband and I are always impressed at the customer service and cleanliness of this place. A pillar of excellence in the Hamburger world."}
{"text":"Stopped by this location on the way out of vegas.  It is about a 5 minute drive from MGM grand and there is always a line in the drive through.  Food was okay- fries were terrible."}
{"text":"Delicious food and quick, but friendly service. This place just seems wholesome. Wish they could get these on the East Coast, but in a way its a fun little treat to get to one of these when you're on the West Coast. So good!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of hamburgers but in -N -out is really good . Love how they make everything fresh and the animal style fries are a must . I love the strawberry  lemonade  . All locations that I had been all the employees are super nice and super fast when it comes to give you your order . Sometimes it's hard to stop by here because the lines can be so long , specially on weekends but if you have a really bad craving , I guess it's worth the wait"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an average inexpensive quick burger this is the place. If you are looking for a great burger that makes you say wow! You are in the wrong place. I have no clue where all the hype comes from. Apparently there are many people who have never eaten a good burger to be able to make a comparison. Be sure to get a double as the patties are tiny. Service was fast friendly and efficient.  Bun and fries were fresh"}
{"text":"What's not to love about a classic in and out burger joint with awesome hours? This place is PACKED no matter what time or day, even at 2AM on a Sunday. But that's okay because there are always a million people working and you get your food very quickly. (Well, for an in and out.)  Also, you may know the standard \"secret menu\", but ask for a whole onion grilled on your burger. It is so good! (No it's not a whole onion but a whole onion slice.)"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and super thin delicious fries. This is an old school burger joint!  They will pile the patties as high as you like, but a double patty with cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and onion is where it's at for me. What can I say? I love the classics!  In-N-Out is a must eat for my fellow East Coasters when you find yourself within chomping distance."}
{"text":"I've tried the big 3: In N Out, Five Guys, and Shake Shack. And of these three once-regional chains, In N Out is by far my least favorite.   The fries are inedible. For purity's sake, I tried them plain, with just cheese, and animal-style. Each time, the fries seized up into a warm potato brick almost immediately after serving.   The burger is a decent burger, I will give them that. But they have never gotten my order right. I wouldn't care so much except that I have numerous severe food allergies. I asked for a single cheeseburger, plain, with pickles and ketchup. What did I get? A double double with cheese, lettuce, onions, and mustard. I ate it because I was starving... But it's like a normal-size version of White Castle. Not worth the trip across I-15.  The iced tea was decent and the burger was filling, but I will not return for a fourth visit."}
{"text":"How could you not love In-N-Out? Surprisingly, even with all the student traffic this location gets from being on UNLV's border, they are speedy quick! Hamburgers are delish (do we really have to go over what they serve here people...I hope this one is self-explanatory ;)) Their pink lemonade is awesome, and I would really like to think their food is healthier than your average burger joint :)."}
{"text":"When your new Phoenix friends say \"You have to try In-N-Out Burger\"...you gotta try In-N-Out burger.  And honestly, what makes a midwest gals heart beat faster than a juicy burger and crispy french fries?? That's right...absolutely nothing. If you're looking for a good burger and a super nice staff that knows the whole 3 item menu and its quirks, In-N-Out is callin' your name. I've recently been atuned to the \"protein\" and \"animal\" style, so if you're there and feelin' crazy...ask for one of the above for a yummy, filling surprise! - hopefully soon, I'll be back to try them myself!"}
{"text":"Mmmm first time having In-N-Out didn't disappoint and from the recommendations I got from people I animal-styled everything! For the price you pay you can't complain for what you get and you get some great stuff.   Honestly, my favorite part was the burgers and I highly recommend getting the double stack. The fries were decent, but I wasn't super impressed by them. Although the animal style made them awesome, I'm not a huge fan of soft/soggy fries and I like my fries with a bit more crunch. Overall, I loved them and will definitely come back so 4 stars from me :)"}
{"text":"Finally tried the burger chain of the west. I ordered their double double burger on drive thru. The burger was satisfactory. It was much better than a typical burger on the strip but a lot cheaper.   The only downside to my experience was the long wait on the drive thru. I don't know whether in n out burgers are known for this but our wait time felt a lot longer. There were about 4 cars ahead of us and waited like 15 minutes."}
{"text":"This place is always busy, so that says a lot! I enjoy their burgers, especially since we don't have this fine establishment back home. The burgers taste fresh, well seasoned, and more importantly not too greasy. Now all I can say is their french fries need to go, they are flavorless, boring and even ketchup can't help improve the taste. I think if they'd change it, I'd give them 5 stars, till then my 4 star rating will stand  This is one place I look forward to when visiting Vegas, especially if I'm craving a burger.  I'll miss you In-N-Out Burger, but we'll be back.  Till next time, happy eating!"}
{"text":"Good stuff as far as fast food burgers are concerned. Better than east coast \"fast food burgers\" Open late enough to grab a quick cheap meal close to the strip.  Plenty of taxi drivers eating there also so it's easy to get back to your resort."}
{"text":"I stopped in after the gym one night got to protein style burgers. Every time I come down and now they have great customer service everybody seems happy. No when I has ever been rude to me and it's great to see all the happy smiles. We will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Five stars for a fast food burger you ask?  Well it's my favorite, and always consistent.  Fries are a must and although I don't drink soda anymore, this is one of those rare exceptions that I will make, as it just compliments the whole experience.  For as fast food burger it doesn't get any better than this!"}
{"text":"If you've never been to In N Out it's an experience you HAVE to try. Alot different than your ordinary fast food chain, the quality and freshness is as good or better than most local places. They cook with fresh and real beef as well as fresh veggies, cheese, and their own buns. You can see them cooking and preparing your burger right in front of you!  The service is quick and the options are many, and if you're concerned about calories or carbs, you need not worry since they got that covered too with their protein style burgers and completely customizable burgers.  Definitely one of the best burger joints in town,  excellent food, quick service, and great quality!"}
{"text":"This In n Out location is going to get a 4 star strictly because of the demographic it attracts. It's basically located on UNLV's campus so at any point throughout the day you might experience some real obnoxious students. Other than that, it's always clean and serves one of the best burgers I've ever had."}
{"text":"Superb!  Great food at a great price.  No excuses customer service.  No matter how busy they always seem to give quick service!"}
{"text":"I usually like to start or end (sometimes both) my trips to Vegas with In-N-Out simply because it never disappoints. My go-to order is the #1 combo (double double \"animal style\", \"extra toast\"). You can taste the freshness of the meat patties and the proportions of the other ingredients (animal sauce, grilled onions, lettuce, tomatoes) create a perfectly balanced burger. The taste of the fries have grown on me over time and complements the burger well. I have yet to discover another burger fast food chain that can replicate the quality, value and consistency of In-N-Out!"}
{"text":"First time having in n out and had to see what the hype was about. Service was pretty quick even though it was very busy. Got cheeseburger animal style, animal style fries and Neapolitan shake. Burger was very good, juicy and flavourful. Fries were also good, but would have been amazing if the cheese sauce was better and less plastic like. Would definitely try again though!"}
{"text":"What can I say.... There is nothing better than a Double Double with grilled onions and fries."}
{"text":"This is my favorite fast-food burger joint.   The menu is small and simple, with just a few items,.  This simplicity is definitely a virtue because it helps In-N-Out to maintain its commitment to high quality ingredients.  Their beef, for example, contains no additives, fillers, or preservatives.  This is important to me because I will rarely eat meat anymore unless I know it's free of sodium nitrate.    The burger comes with beef, crisp whole-leaf iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, and thinly sliced onions with a sauce which seems to consist of  mayonnaise, ketchup and relish.  With cheese, it's only 359 calories.  The fries are made from potatoes that are peeled and diced at each store and cooked fresh in 100% trans-fat free, cholesterol-free vegetable oil.  There are no small, medium, large, or \"biggie\" options.  You just get a well-proportioned cardboard boat of fries.   In-N-Out doesn't use heat lamps or microwaves because the burgers and fries are cooked fresh to order.    In-N-Out is also one of those rare fast-food restaurants that make their milk shakes with real ice-cream.   Their commitment to quality and simplicity translates into great tasting food, and also allows them to keep the prices low.  Being on a student's budget, this is one of my favorite things about In-N-Out Burger.  A hamburger is $175, with cheese it's $2.05.  An order of fries is only $1.35.  And a milkshake is just $1.95.  Another thing about In-N-Out is that there's almost always a long line of cars at the drive-thru when you arrive, but because of the distance between the ordering station and the pick-up window, you rarely have to wait long to order.  The line moves fast and your order is timed to be ready when you get to the pick-up window.  So don't let the long lines deter you.  Because of their great tasting burgers, quality ingredients, and low prices, I'm giving In-N-Out Burger the highest rating I could give to any fast-food restaurant -- 4 stars."}
{"text":"We came around 6:45 PM and line up was out the door. It was probably due to the holiday and everyone was in Vegas. I ordered a double double with onions to go. Even though there were a lot of people waiting to order, the cashier didn't rush anything but also repeated my order to confirm they got it right. I really appreciated that. However, the line up for pick up was just ridiculous. It was chaotic: people who just ordered stood in front of the counter even though there was already a line formed. There was absolutely no order here and I literally had to push my way through to get my food.   I enjoyed my double double. The two beef patties tasted great. The amount of the sauce was just right, it didn't make the bun all soggy and a mess to eat. It was definitely better than McDonalds. Other than that, it was nothing special. In-N-Out Burger is a great and cheap option if you are looking for a quick fix. However, that also depends on how bad the line up is, in that case, you might not be \"in-n-out\" at all."}
{"text":"This In n Out Burger was really good.  I love In n Out burgers because they are special to go to because there aren't any In n Out burgers in Colorado.                    In n out burger is a fast food restaurant so I didn't interact with the staff so much.  When I did interact with the staff the were super nice.  The woman at the ordering counter is delightful.  She had a huge smile on her face and was such a pleasure to be around.  A very nice man helped us carry our food to our table.  All employees were wearing white uniforms, all were clean.  Their hair was tucked up into white hats away from the food.                  I'm pretty sure you can guess what was on the menu.  Burgers! Burgers were delicious.   They had such flavor. I was very impressed with the fries.  They were made right there at In n Out Burger. In the bottom of the fry boat it said that since 1948 they have been cooking their fries in 100% trans fat free cholesterol free vegetable oil.  Their potatoes are peeled and diced  fresh at each store and are cooked fresh for their customers.  Fries can be very unhealthy especially if you eat them frequently.  However, I thought the fries could have cooked a small amount of time longer they  weren't under cooked they just weren't as crunchy as most fries.                     To be in In n Out burger is to be in In n Out Burger's ambiance. They have created an ambiance that says fast food.  The red and white colored building is a great place if you want to eat fast food.  it is a place where you get in and get out, not a sit down and relax place.  It is perfect for a hot summer's day when you need take out or a quick place but don't expect dinner! p.s. try the strawberry milkshake"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why everyone loses their shit over In-N-Out Burger. I mean, they're good, but I've had better.   This joint was absolutely busting to the seams with hungry folks looking for their fast food fix on a Wednesday at lunch time. The lines were long, the wait for our food was substantial and the seating is scarce. Ugh.   As for the food? Well, the burgers are pretty tasty, but Portillo's in Chicago stomps this competition for my favorite fast food burger. The toppings, like the tomatoes and lettuce are crisp and fresh, but the burger itself is thin, sad and unsubstantial. Good, but not great.  And if I'm being honest, my stomach wasn't quite right after lunch.  The fries? Kinda soggy. They require lots of ketchup.   And what's up with the menu? Hamburger, cheeseburger or double burger? That's it? No chicken? WTF?"}
{"text":"I love this burger, I go ever time I am out west which is not often enough.  You have to try the animal style.  I would say everyone that heads to Vegas needs to head over to In-N-Out and enjoy a tasty burger, and some wonderful hand cut fries.  I hope at some point we can get them to come east."}
{"text":"It's pretty much a given that In-N-Out is amazing and if you don't like it, then there is something very wrong with you. So this rating is for the service. This is probably the busiest location, but the food comes out pretty quick considering all the people. I didn't realize how great the service was here until I went to an empty In-N-Out in North Scottsdale and my food took forever. Oh and quick tips, my favs are a neapolitan shake and animal fries, YUM!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Probably not the healthiest food, especially since I took red meat out of my diet.  But when I relapse, I rush to In-N-Out.  And since they came to Scottsdale, I have been relapsing a lot.  Delicious, juicy meat with fresh veggies - and prices are very reasonable.  Unsalted fries.  Never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I love eat burgers especially the double double and animal fries. That is so so so so so good."}
{"text":"OMG!  This is the best burger I had ever had. The best!!  My entire family craves their food when we are in Las Vegas or California.  The buns are perfectly toasted. The lettuce and tomato are always fresh. The animal fries hits the spot. The milkshakes are thick and creamy.  The staff works hard and are politely. Its always busy so be prepared to wait. They also have a merchandise store near by the restaurant to buy souvenirs."}
{"text":"Awesome. It's a So Cal staple that's as good here in the desert  as it is on the shore.   I'm sure you've all heard about the secret menu, great shakes, etc. So I'll just tell you how I do it at In-N-Out, and I'll do it with the same skill as they do: I'll leave you wanting more.  DO NOT STUFF YOURSELF! I'm a big guy, and I usually get a cheeseburger animal style and a flying dutchman. Under $5 and the perfect amount. Believe me, the flavors are so potent it's easy to get carried away.  See what I mean; you want more, right? That's the secret sauce..."}
{"text":"I had to park my car to write this review! When I say the most beautiful and pleasant people ever. I just went through the drive through and my experience was worth writing about. The two women who helped me not only were drop dead gorgeous they're customer service was unmatched. It is 11:54pm and they both seemed so excited to be at work. I haven't had in-n-out in a while but I'll be sure to visit this one the next time I have a craving. I wish I got there names :("}
{"text":"My first time at an In-N-Out and I honestly didn't get what all the fuss was about. Burger (Double Double) was solid - flavorful and fresh - but the fries were bad ... cold, limp, disappointing. By far Shake Shack is better in every respect."}
{"text":"Everytime I am try'n to get me a double double the lines & drive thru's are out the doors & in the street. Best believe it is worth the wait tho... YUMMMMMMY!"}
{"text":"This is the only fast food place we ever go to. It happens to be on my flight pattern from work so.... a few times a year a double double with grilled onions gets to be dinner.  I have never had a bad burger or experience here. In and Out does it right! I am also happy to support a place that pays their \"associates\" more than minimum wage. Not because they have to, but because it is the right thing to do."}
{"text":"Amazing food, super affordable and wonderful service from the staff consistently but my goodness PLEASE make an in and out that's not in the crappiest parking lot ever. This one is by a good will and a 99 cent store, Chuck E. Cheese and gas station. No room for anything and if you dare park people will probably not let you get out of your space because they are waiting behind your car in in and outs line. And I can't count how many times I've been cut off by another car right before I pull up in line. People are seriously crazy in this parking lot. My stomach says in and out but I have a little panic attack mentally preparing for entering that parking lot."}
{"text":"they usually put my side of pickles in the wrong bag and get pickle juice all over my food. But everyone is so nice and the food is so good."}
{"text":"The customer service here is fantasic. Food is consistent every time I come and the milkshakes ate bomb!!!! Bring yo friends!"}
{"text":"You have to love the In-N-out!   Enjoyed them since I lived in California in  the 1980's. You have all those better burger chains like Smash Burger (which is good) that tries to compete with the all time great In-N-Out and they just can't you can get a double/double with fries and a drink for less than $6.50 and the same at Smash Burger is $10.00."}
{"text":"I've heard about In-N-Out Burger ever since I was a kid and have always wanted to try it. In fact, according to a recent food survey on the internet I read that it was voted the best burger joint in America. Thus my expectations were rather high when I stepped into this burger joint.  I have to admit the burger was good, marginally better than any that I've had at other fast food franchises. Perhaps it was a classic case of overly high expectations, but I wasn't blown away by the food either.  The burgers were cheap,$1.69 for a cheese burger, which along with their tasty fare is probably the reason for their success.  Nevertheless, I didn't think the food was worth the $30 cab ride from and to our hotel, but if I was driving around with car I wouldn't mind stopping by once in awhile."}
{"text":"I don't eat hamburgers unless its from here! Doesn't matter what location in n out is always fresh :)"}
{"text":"The first time I had in and out I loved it. Several visits to spots around town and I have been less than impressed. Ready to right the business off entirely when hubby took me and the little one to this location. Stopped in for lunch and got food pretty fast even though they were busy, when I tried my burger... WOW. Fantastic. I practically swallowed my burger whole and then wished I had a second. Fries were good too and not cold and hard like I've had before. Must be this location, but I'm hooked again."}
{"text":"I was eating watching the employees prepare the food and take orders. No one was standing around or goofing off everyone was working hard and getting guests thru the line. The fries are to die for!"}
{"text":"I wish I could rate 0 stars because we gave this place several chances. First, the line was incredibly long for a Thursday at midnight- good for them. Second, we ordered our food and waited 20 minutes as they called up to 15 numbers more than our number. This wouldn't have been that big of a deal had we not had to ask about where our food was. We waited an additional 5 minutes before we got our food and got no apology. LAST, someone stole my drink as we were waiting (which had my receipt on it). I felt at first that someone must have stolen our food. But the person handing out the food was checking receipts. So this is In N Out's staff's fault. I'll never come here again."}
{"text":"I don't get it. Is it the burnt grilled onions? Or the greasy patties? The fries definitely taste horrible. But every In and out are packed every time I drive by them. Kudos to them for somehow getting people to wait for crap."}
{"text":"In-N-Out, one of the last great hamburger joints in America.  What I love about them more than anything else though is their consistently great customer service.  The employees at every store I've ever seen are well trained, extremely polite, and appear to be genuinely happy to be at work.  Clearly this company has strong values and their teams live them every day.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Born and raised eating In N Out. Another pkace to check out if you havent been. They have them all over southern California where im from. Fresh hambuger and fries!! Dont forget to get your hambuger and fries with a shake for a couple cents more."}
{"text":"What ever I go to In Out Burger the food and service is consistant.  Always fast and served fresh.  Limited menu but what else more do you need."}
{"text":"I totally used to love this place.  Went here for dinner last night, woke up a few hours later with food poisoning.  My boyfriend had a plain cheeseburger, mine was animal style.  He didn't get sick but i did. Now i can't even keep a little sip of water down.  I can safely say I will never eat at in n out ever again."}
{"text":"DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE.  This has got to be the worst burger and fries I've ever had. I was visiting Vegas for a girls trip and we decided to come here since everyone knew how excited I was to try this since it was my first time and it was in a convenient location for our plans.  Our fries were hard as rocks. No amount of cheese or whatever \"special\" sauce they put in their animal fries could have saved that disaster. Our burger was dry and tasteless. The seating was overly crowded. Not worth the hype at all. Shake shack would have been a way better option. This will be my first and last time. Not worth your money or time."}
{"text":"Really excited to get this, as we don't have an In & Out in the Midwest. Went late night; service was nice. Food did take quite some time to arrive and people that ordered after us were receiving their orders before us. It also didn't taste quite as good as when we've gotten it in California. Can't quite pinpoint it, but the quality just wasn't the same."}
{"text":"I had forgotten that Vegas had In-N-Out, and it was a delightful surprise. As always, the food was delicious, the service fast, and the experience great, made even more so because we introduced two friends to it for the first time.  Excellent introduction for them."}
{"text":"It's In-N-Out if you've ever been to one you know what to expect. If you haven't the menu isn't huge just get a double double and you will be fine. There is a \"not so secret menu\" if you want things a little different, see google. They have quality food at a very reasonable price. The fries are fresh cut potatoes cooked in vegetable oil which I personally don't like but many people do. It's 5 stars for fast food standards."}
{"text":"If you are reading a review on In-N-Out...I am slightly worried that you have been living in some sort of underground shelter for way too long. Then again, you may just be looking to see what items to order to shake up your current order. So here's my favorite: grilled cheese...yes, they make grilled cheese at In-N-Out and they are oh-so-good! If you order just a grilled cheese it will come exactly like the cheeseburger minus the meat; they throw on all the same toppings. You can also order a grilled cheese-plain. This will be the toasted buns with a cheesy center of wow! I like to get one of each, one plain, and one regular minus the sauce and sub regular onions for grilled onions- so in a sense, animal style minus the sauce. :-) I also like their fries. I will get them animal style minus the sauce. You end up with a box of fries with melted cheese and grilled onions. So good! And the bottom half usually doesn't have toppings so you also get some plain fries. Wash it all down with a coke! All American Yumminess!"}
{"text":"I've been to many In-N-Outs all over California but this is the first one I've been to that was out of state.  The food is great of course and my rating does not reflect that.  What it does reflect is the difference in service speed as compared to other In-N-Outs I've been to before.  This place is wayyyy slower!  The drive-thru took forever.  Walking in to order is not much faster.  Try to get here before you're actually starving because you will be by the time you get your food."}
{"text":"The best commercial Burgers I ever had. They taste like homemade. Try them!! I were two times in two days there.   There Fried with cheese were also delicious."}
{"text":"Classic burgers here. It's always busy and I know exactly why. The location is great! The service is good."}
{"text":"Hands down the best fast food burger chain in the world.  In-N-Out always delivers the goods. Tip: Do it animal style."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch occasionally because it's relatively close. There's really no other place to go at the time because everything in the area opens at 11 AM. So, instead of waiting I go to In-N-Out. Of course you should know that the prices will always be relatively expensive, you pay about $6 a meal, I'm not sure about just burgers. The food is good, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't stand up to other joints like Five Guys or even some burgers and standard fast food restaurants. A friend of mine found a hair in her fries, and in some instances the staff can be rude."}
{"text":"This was my second ever trip to In n Out. So yes, I did go twice within 24 hours because the food is indeed everything it is made out to be.  On this visit I ordered the double double mustard grilled burger, fries well done (double fried), and the Neapolitan Shake (chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry) - all of which were stellar. Fresh ingredients and extremely friendly staff make for a wonderful experience at these burger joints. All chains are within a certain distance from the ingredient manufacturer in order to ensure fresh same day delivery of products, and it is very apparent.  I can definitely see why In n Out is such a renowned burger joint on the west coast. While in the quick moving line I FaceTimed my brother back home in the south because I knew he had been a few months prior, he practically shed a tear from wanting an In n Out burger so badly. I didn't realize the effect that the FaceTime was going to have on him but it just goes to show how amazing these restaurants truly are!"}
{"text":"The Double-Double Burger was good as always. The fries were dry and the vanilla shake literally tasted and had the texture of whipped foam- Yuck! This is not the vanilla shake I remember having before.  Also this specific In-N-Out is always super busy, but the food quality has never been superior to any other In-N-Out I've ate at."}
{"text":"Good fries.    Burgers---thin dry patties (they need to double em' up to get a true hamburger size), pre-shaped (not good), and lettuce, tomatoe, onion is the majority any of the burgers.    This is not the \"best ever burger joint\"...  I just don't get the loyal following--sorry."}
{"text":"Burgers are made to order & you can see the kitchen where you food gets cooked. Fries not frozen & are cut fresh. Had a large order, so we decided to go inside. Asked to mark plain burger & they offered to double wrap it. Forgot to get say that I needed my order to go, so as the order was almost done I put in the request & this was at a busy time, but they got it done without fuss. Outdoor & indoor seating kept clean; plus employees will ask if you need anything while they are cleaning. Bonus- Employees seems happy and cheerful. I think In & Out is an amazing fast food place!"}
{"text":"So good to get my hands on a double. It's been 5 years. Still awesome as usual. First time getting the chocolate shake, but Wendy's frostie is better."}
{"text":"Double-double... WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL OF MY LIFE??!! Ahhhhh this thing is SO amazingly good! I'm craving it just thinking about it!   nom, nom, nom!"}
{"text":"Double double the other day was excellent. Fresh beef. Fresh cut fries and real shakes.    A must."}
{"text":"Is this place more expensive than other In-N-Out's?  I feel it is.  Either way it's less than $3.50 for a damn cheeseburger!  Lose all your money at Harrah's?  Busker for 5 minutes and grab a burger from here, your day will get better.  I'm still not a fan of the fries but I'll be damned if I don't stop for a burger.  The is always packed but they get through the orders fairly quickly.  I was waiting for sketchiness to happen the couple of times I was here but nope!"}
{"text":"Man.... what a disappointment. We had talked about In-N-Out all trip and were so excited to try it since we were on the West Coast. We went at 3PM and it was PACKED. The line took forever and the parking lot was a mess.  When we got the food.. we could not have been more lacklustered. The fries were actually bad.. no sauce or animal style could save them. Burgers were fine but nothing to brag about. I'm sad to say this was just a very overrated experience for us and we won't be back."}
{"text":"3 stars only because it is In N Out but the customer service I have come accustom too are not here at this location. I go back every now and again just to see if they have gotten better but its the total opposite. The food is also not the standard In N Out typically puts out but hey its Burgers and Fries so I don't expect much."}
{"text":"One of the best fastfood chains in the US! I always go to In-N-Out when I'm on the West Coast and this location didn't dissapoint. The location is nice and clean, and of course with heavy duty air-condition. The burgers are absolutely glorious."}
{"text":"I have to say, I'm not terribly impressed.  I mean, with all the hype, I was half expecting to derive some sort of sexual pleasure from my hamburger.  It didn't happen.  THE GOOD: Hamburgers are pretty good (Although I've had better)  Service is always great  They'll put your order in a box if you're eating it in the car  THE BAD: The fries suck.  I'm sorry, but they do.  They're terrible.  It's not exactly \"fast food\" when there are 375,918,003 customers waiting in line.  I'm not thrilled with the \"secret menu\" thing.  Seriously, if I have to be a Navajo Code Talker to order off your damn menu, that's not cool.  BOTTOM LINE:  In-N-Out makes for a nice change of pace.  The burgers are certainly better than say, McDonald's or Burger King.  A little more expensive than your average fast food establishment, but all the cool kids eat here."}
{"text":"Not the best burger I've ever had, but very good.  Restaurant is always very clean, and the employees are always very welcoming."}
{"text":"If you have to yelp what's good at In-N-Out, then just....smh  Delicious as always. Always have to try and get it whenever I make a west coast trip. Get some well done fries though. I hate how normal fries aren't really crunchy. Well done isn't too much better but at least it's something."}
{"text":"Having traveled from Seattle today, we just wanted a quick meal before turning in.  We saw this In-N-Out close to the hotel and it did not disappoint.  Had a Cheeseburger with fries and my husband had the double double.  Absolutely love the food.  Service was phenomenal as always.   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pros: The best burgers I have ever eaten. Secret menu is fascinating. Fries are pretty much perfect. Cheaper than Carl's Jr. Better than Fatburger in pretty much every way.  Cons: Should be 24 hours. Not enough locations.(Then again, if there were more it would probably downgrade to the level of McDonald's)  In-N-Out, you are amazing. There may be a place out there that serves better burgers, but I have yet to find it."}
{"text":"We only come here for will. For how long the lines were we got our food quick and it was amazing.  The lines move quick and the staff is very friendly as I said especially will."}
{"text":"I LOVE YOU IN N OUT!! I was introduced to In N Out on a trip to Cali, haven't gotten over it! This is a \"must stop\" spot, every time we're in Vegas.  Usually about twice a day! I love your cute little codes and \"secret menu\" that just happens to be posted through your site! THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"This was our first experience with In-N-Out. It was quite busy. The staff members made good eye contact, seemed comfortable with the fray, were efficient & genuinely friendly. The restaurant was clean, well lit & the customer flow pattern worked. The calling out of customer numbers was much more efficient as the PA system was too loud & uncomfortable. Our food arrived in a timely manner with a helper to carry everything, even though it was so busy. Each of us ordered burgers & they were delicious. The vegetables were fresh, meat patty actually reached to the edges of the buns! Our shakes taste like a malt/shake combo.  The fries & buns were very dry. The fries were seasoned well but very dry, almost stale in texture and appearance.  I think we will go back again, hoping that the dry fries & buns were a fluke.  Very pleased with ALL other aspects of our service. Excellent training happening there."}
{"text":"Haven't had In-N-Out since the last time I was in Vegas 2 years ago. I always recommend this to anyone who has never been on this side of the coast because it's something new without breaking the bank. We went at a pretty busy time but despite that they kept things organized and got food to us pretty quick. My boyfriend got a double-double with no lettuce, tomato, or pickle and the burger was drenched in sauce, I got a cheeseburger with everything on it and mine had pretty good proportions. Great food for the price, definitely better than McDonald's"}
{"text":"If you crave fast food this is the one. Not MacDonalds or Burger King! Each patty is juicy and flavourful served on soft bun and with a large portion of fries in the side. I prefer the outlet in San Francisco to this Vegas one though"}
{"text":"Why do people go crazy about this place. Burgers aren't that special. Coming in a Taxi? This place should have a van to return folks to strip. I rather go to local burger."}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out! I was raised on it, as a former Cali girl, and to this day I love going there for animal style fries and a burger with grilled onions. This particular time, I was helped by JoAnn who was so wonderful. She happily took my order, we chatted a bit about the Cubs, and when I forgot to take my receipt she kindly brought my order to me, all while having a big smile on her face. JoAnn is a wonderful employee and I hope that anyone who goes to this In-N-Out gets a chance to meet her!"}
{"text":"home away from home. I love In n Out Birgers. They are always fast in service and never dissapoint"}
{"text":"My family & I decided to try this pace on a whim when trying to decide on a inexpensive quick lunch during our stay in Vegas! We had no idea what to expect but boy were we pleasantly surprised! The prices were cheap and the burgers and shakes were great! It's location is off the strip so we hailed a cab but it wasn't too far off. Getting a seat is a bit difficult because of how busy they are so I'd recommend bringing some friends to keep their eyes peeled for tables that might open. Because as quickly as a seat is emptied, it is filled and so it's a bit of a challenge if you're wanting to sit in. Other than that, a must try for those who love a good burger without the hefty price tags while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Although In-N-Out doesn't need any description, still felt the need to review! So glad Vegas got a location on the strip. Usual fast and friendly service! As busy as it was still a clean location. Great experience as always!"}
{"text":"In 'N' Out Rules!!!  The food is always great, and in the rare event your food is not up to par, call the 800 number and you will be well  taken care of. :P"}
{"text":"Every time I make it back to the West, I always stop here first. Favorite location bar none. Never disappointed no mater what time I visit. I can always count on the same warm fast pace service, amazing food, and the friendly staff. Love love love."}
{"text":"So I've never been here so my lil brother and my gf wanted to go eat there after we get Dutch bros next to it so of course i said ok. We go and order to number twos and my brother finishes his and my gf gave him half of hers and as he gets to the end he find that its red. Not only was it red but it was bloody red. I go ask to speak with the manager and all he does is say ok im sorry ill have a talk with my cooks and asked of i want another burger. I tell him no i just want my money back and out of almost 13$ he gives me $2 back and walks away. Past his cooks and employees and doesn't say a word to them. I will no longer be eating here and to anyone who does be safe and check your g Food. Worst experience ever"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers ever. Between fast food and sit down restaurants, In-N-Out completely knows how to make a fantastic burger. Freshly cut fried fries, flavorful burgers with thousand island sauce, and a simple chocolate shake (that is made perfectly) are my go-to's. If you are from the East coast and don't have In-N-Out, you definitely have to check this place out."}
{"text":"Cheap, Taste awesome. No big menu's to where you can't decide on what to eat. Do try \"Animal Style\" wether on your fries or burgers. It's thousand island, bacon and cheese. I'm a Cheese Burger Fanatic!!!"}
{"text":"Seemed to be really slow tonight prolly because they will be closing soon. But.... still"}
{"text":"Their food is always amazing. My favorite is a number 2 with everything on it and add pickle lol.  Also get their pink lemonade it's my favorite I never get another drink when I go."}
{"text":"Sorry, this AZ In-and-Out Burger crew needs to spend some time in a CA In-and-Out. First, asked for plenty of ketchup for 3 people, was promised enough for 5 and received 4 packets. Second, fries were like cardboard and almost tasteless. Okay place but double check your order and keep your expectations low on the fry side."}
{"text":"My favorite burger...even better being next to Krispy Kreme, take care of two meals at once!"}
{"text":"Best fast food burger join in phoenix - can get busy at lunch time, but they have always gotten my order right!"}
{"text":"It's the best fast-food burger on the planet and one of the best burgers period. It was the first place I hit up after getting off the plane. The line was long but the employees kept it moving and the wait was only a few minutes. If you've been to one, you already know how good it is; if you haven't, you need to go."}
{"text":"Great food with a wonderful group of employees. Always friendly, fast and efficient. We love this place."}
{"text":"It's as good as always. This location though whoever picked and designed this layout should be fired! Pain in the ass to get in, pain in the ass to get out!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been visiting this location for years and we love it, always clean, fast and friendly service The burger... we all know in and out, always fresh and simple menu, perfect for my family and me."}
{"text":"So delicious. In n out is definitely the \"go to\" burger place in Chandler. Their animal style cheeseburger and animal style fries delicious. They are always really clean and have a nice, quick staff. Amazing location, but an even better company!"}
{"text":"This place is busy as it isn't that far from Excalibur and New York New York.  And you can expect your order to take forever.  The last time I was there my number was 87.  They were only in the 50s.  And for some reason I had to wait until after they got back around to 12 before they called my number.  Nothing fancy to hold up the order.  Hamburgers are very good.  French fries not so much.  And you would think the milk shakes would be made with ice cream, but alas no milk shake mixers here.  It's from a machine like Mickey D's.  If you've ever had french fries from Five Guys, those are GREAT french fries.  These were bland french fries.  I guess people get them animal style to make them tolerable.  They would have gotten 4 stars with better fries and real milkshakes."}
{"text":"Since I don't have one in my state and I loved them when I visited friends in SoCal I always get at least one when I go to Vegas. I'm not the only one, and that is why it's always busy, which is fine. The longest I've ever had to wait here was 10 minutes.  My suggestion, ask for animal style. Grilled onions on your burger.  You also might run into a celebrity here."}
{"text":"Good price quick service. However every once in a while the burger just isn't put together right and the meat hangs out of the burger."}
{"text":"Never have I ever had an issue with IN N OUT. Their food always comes out in a timely fashion and it's one fast food place that my order never gets messed up. However tonight, I was pretty disappointed in the fact I watched numbers 17-28 come and go along with 25 minutes and still nothing. (I was number 16 and there was only one other couple who ordered ahead of me) families with larger parties received their food faster and it was only me and one other person. I'm still giving them 3 stars because the quality is still great but they might need to figure out how to stay in order of the orders or at least relatively close to it."}
{"text":"I just spent 30 minutes in the drive thru. The girl read back my order on the speaker, all good. Then I get to the pay window and part of the order is wrong. I correct her and she fixes it on the receipt, reflecting what I originally ordered. Ok. Then I get to the pickup window and this girl reads me something that sounds like it could have been the right order, but I figured she didn't wanna read off the details cuz she was busy or whatever. At this point I'm just really tired and I want to go home and eat, so I say yeah. They ended up getting half the order right, but it didn't even taste good. Worst and slowest in n out experience I've had."}
{"text":"Great service and friendly staff! Unacceptable wait times in their drive thru. Chocolate shake makes up for it."}
{"text":"On the Whole30 food challenge which is a stricter version of Paleo.  After 2 wks, I needed something quick and not scratch cooked from whole foods.  Googled and found this tasty item, which the cashier really kindly and very friendly entered in:  **Double meat w/ mustard, onion (raw), extra tomato, chilies, protein style (aka wrapped in lettuce).    I'll hold the chilies next time, little hot for me.. but I didn't even know that option existed!"}
{"text":"Not a bad burger, price is good , employees are nice. French Fries are probably the wurst I have had. Like eating a piece of hard foam. Won't return."}
{"text":"I've done several reviews of several In n Out locations. As stated in other reviews, you either love In n Out, or you don't. I personally am a huge fan.   In n Out is as consistent as they get. I have never been to a location where the food and service slightly varied. Always hot, fresh, cooked to order burgers and fries. I usually get a single with cheese and spread only.  When hungrier I get the double double.   This location is located on The Strip in the Linq Promenade. My wife and I got there right when they opened at 10:30am on a Friday, so it was not super busy. But it did not take long for the line to grow. I can only imagine how slammed this location gets. They are all busy, but I bet this has to be one of the busiest there is. Regardless, In n Out knows how to handle volume, so I would gladly go at a peak time."}

I usually get a single with cheese and spread only.  When hungrier I get the double double.   What you need to know about this location, is that it may be the busiest In n Out there is, and that is saying a lot because they are all busy. Being that this one is very close to the Vegas strip, you can imagine it is busy at all hours. If you want to avoid the rush, you might be able to at 10:30a when they open. That said, the location is run well like all of them, so it is well staffed and they handle the massive volumes just fine. The seating is usually full, but usually by the time your food is ready enough tables will free up that you can grab one, as long as you are paying attention. When I ate here yesterday I ended up joining another couple that was at a table of four. Not an uncommon practice at this location. Parking can also be limited, but usually not a problem. You will see people at this location pull up in Ubers or taxis on their way to or from the airport. People love it so much some can't even wait to get to their hotel before grabbing a burger there. Or they want one last one before flying home. I have done it myself."}
{"text":"You either love love love In N Out or you don't. Personally I am obviously a fan. I get a double double with cheese and spread only.   If you know In N Out, you likely know it is one of the most consistent chains out there. I have never been to one where the experience was any different. They are almost always busy, always polite, the food is fresh and consistent as it gets. It can take a little while, but not too long at all.   This location is just as consistent as the rest. Clearly they follow the strict In N Out standards. I usually visit at least once when in Vegas for business. As this is near the Strip, it can get even busier than most locations. I have seen many a folks on their way to and from the airport make the stop with their luggage. In N Out has that big of a following.   Of all the burger chains out there now, In N Out is still my favorite.   If you have not tried In N Out, you really should. You may not like, but you might absolutely fall in love."}
{"text":"\"Two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese.....\" Wait a minute... This isn't the golden arches.. This is much much better.  With a tag line of, \"Quality you can taste\" you better deliver an amazing product and In-N-Out goes way beyond my expectations.   FOOD: 5/5 stars  This has to be one of if not the best tasting fast food burger in America.  The flavors of the cheese, lettuce, sauce and hamburger work so well together and the bun is just melt in your mouth, double D delicious.  The fries actually taste like fresh cut potatoes, not that mashed together again fake fries a lot of fast food joints serve.   my double double with animal style fries! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qG_WEgPa8MBo1dPUOkTMlw?select=FT9xeB10CA3NEO03SwdIqw  PRICE: 5/5 stars  Fast food is suppose to be cheap, when you start paying over $10 for a fast food meal for a processed product that is not healthy for you, something has gone wrong with America.  In-N-Out has very cheap reasonable prices for the quality of ingredients that they use.  When you actually taste their burgers, you'll realize how much better it tastes than the big fast food american chains.  You won't be disappointed.  VARIETY: 4/5 stars  Okay so if you're looking for a chicken wrap, chicken bowl, salad, or hot dogs, etc.. LOOK ELSEWHERE.. This is not sonic with their 128,000 choices for drinks, this is In-N-Out where you come here for a damn good hamburger and fries.  What they lack in variety they make up in their secret menu.  You can take a look at the link below for a list of the secret menu, I will give my caveat here by saying i have not tried to order all the different secret menus, but if i lived in a place where i could eat In-N-Out regularly, I'd try to get them all..   http://www.badmouth.net/in-n-outs-secret-menu/  The In-N-Out menu! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qG_WEgPa8MBo1dPUOkTMlw?select=VxNLm-e2BbW2PXpvR89B9A  SERVICE: 4/5 stars  Good service, the place does get busy and so wait times may get a little long but most people will wait for \"quality they can taste\".  The staff never hesitates to fulfill the needs of a customer and the facilities are kept tidy and clean  INTANGIBLES: 5/5 stars  I've eaten a lot of fast food and I can honestly say that In-N-Out is the only place that I do not feel so guilty after eating a meal.  Yes it is still a burger and yes they still deep fry their potatoes but at least there are no additives in their food.  You are eating a quality product for a super cheap price.  In-N-Out - simply the best. nuff sed."}
{"text":"I can always count on In-N-Out to taste the same anywhere I go and that is one of the best things I love about them. No matter which location, I know that I will get the same great taste that I remember them to have. This location is really busy as it is in the Linq promenade so there is a lot of people nearby and stopping in here. There can be super long lines so just account for that especially when it's lunch or dinner time. The only thing you have to realize is that since it is in Las Vegas, there is a slight upcharge than what SoCal-ers may be used to."}
{"text":"My go to burger place! Not a fan of toasted bun so protein style is the jam with a side of cheese fries and vanilla milk shake. Staff is always friendly and attentive. Orders are always right!"}
{"text":"It's good. This location is busy every time I go so you do have to be patient when ordering and waiting for food. The milkshakes are very good."}
{"text":"\"You don't appreciate what you have until you lose it\"  It's so true! I moved to the Midwest recently and missed in n out!  Nothing beats a double double with animal style fries!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, except the fries were kind of bitter. Not sure what all the fuss is about."}
{"text":"Yum!  Can anyone say anything bad about In-N-Out?  I had my usual, cheeseburger animal style and fries, with a big pile of the hot pickled peppers. The service was quick and luckily we got there early because shortly after we got our food, a huge line formed and people were hovering, waiting for tables to open up.  The food was delicious, as usual, and I'm crying now, wishing we had an In-N-Out in the tristate area.  The best part of this location is how friendly the staff are. Maybe I'm just used to my east coast coldness but I guess everyone in AZ is just super nice and not in that creepy midwesterner way but just a genuine happy niceness."}
{"text":"Ok so I usually write longer reviews, but if you haven't found or heard of this place yet.....well I feel sorry for you. Awesome burgers, awesome fresh fries, great shakes and lemonades, great service. Oh and super cheap, I mean cheaper than mcdonalds garbage. Go animal style."}
{"text":"As my first In-N-Out experience, I have to say I was impressed. From the cheap food to friendly service who wouldn't be?  You have two options when ordering, either drive-thru or order and sit down inside. The lines can get pretty outrageous especially during the lunch hour, so just beware. Although the line does move fairly quick, at least through the drive thru.  My first meal here, I came with a friend who used to be a local in Vegas. So lets just say he knew what he was talking about.  I ordered a regular cheeseburger with everything on it. It was roughly $2.50. It was the perfect size and absolutely delicious. Great for a cheap lunch or dinner.  Next, my friend recommended I get the meal and upgrade the drink to a milkshake. Now, it doesn't say on the menu but you can get a neopolitan shake which is chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry mixed. I fell in love with this milkshake. A must try!   The meal comes with fries also. Now the fries are awesome because they don't add salt automatically for you. They put packets inside the bag for you to use if you want it added. In my personal opinion I like the fries unsalted, you can actually taste the potato rather than the sodium.  If your on vacation or just have never tried In-N-Out.....go now!!!!!"}
{"text":"This location is on the Linq Promenade and is always busy.  Nevertheless, the staff does an amazing job.  They have a good attitude and they are very efficient."}
{"text":"The place was packed around lunch time, which can be expected.  So I sat outside in 109 deg weather (which locals are used to, it's a litle warm for a Yankee), and started to roast and didn't even realize the metal table and bench were piping hot and leaving burn marks....Because when  you have a plate with an animal style double double in front of you, there's just nothing else in the world that matters.  I miss you already In-n-out.  Small request, and I don't mean to knit pick.  please learn how to make french fries.  I  know you do it naturally and such, but let's get it together guys..in 2013, a plate of fries that doesn't have a week's worth of salt in them shouldn't be considered a culinary breakthrough.  That said, I forgive you because  your cheeseburgers make me so happy.  Also, service is very friendly and fast.  Def give them credit for navigating the chaos and still being nice about it.."}
{"text":"As soon as I booked my trip to LV, the thing I was most excited about was In-n-out burger.  I even rented a car so I could go there whenever I wanted.  The place is totally packed, but they are fast there.  The long line goes by fast and once you order, they cook your food quickly.  Which is key.  Waiting there when you see all the other people eating those amazing burgers while the smell is everywhere is torture.    We each had two cheeseburgers and split fries and a shake. I actually prefer 2 cheeseburgers to a double double.  Thats just me in general.  I don't usually order double cheeseburgers anywhere.  Same with shake shack, I get regular cheeseburgers.   As soon as I took a burger out and bit into it, the rental car expense and the yearning was completely validated.  The bun is great, and the sauce tastes really good.  Ketchup / mayo combination?  Tastes kinda like Big Mac sauce only better.  Technically , I'm not sure how good the actual patty is - it's pretty thin and cooked throughout..but it's fast food and tastes amazing mixed with the cheese, lettuce, tomato, sauce and bun..   The fries are made right there when they put these potatoes through some sort of machine that slices them up, and they are delicious without being too greasy.  It just amazes me that for 2 people to eat this meal, it was like 12 bucks.  It actually depresses me that they don't have this on the east coast and I will have to wait until I go back to vegas or somewhere else out west to experience in n out again.  OMG i can't wait to go back there, its just incredible!!"}
{"text":"Pros: Great food, limited menu with secret menu items, high quality for fast food  Cons: Always busy   One of my favorite fast food places. Always a popular place to check out when people come in from out of town. The staff is always great. I recommend the secret 3x3. They make everything fresh and you can tell. Of all the times I've been I've only had one messed up order. One negative, it is too busy to go on a quick lunch break."}
{"text":"Grimiest one I have ever been to. Horrible service, horrible burgers and ultimately disgusting bathrooms. It's probably my fault for coming all the way to Las Vegas and deciding to eat at an In-N-Out."}
{"text":"This In-N-Out is set up just like every other In-N-Out. Walk in and there are you face the counter topped with three cash registered. As you walk forward, the restrooms will be on your right (with the men's on the left and women's on the right should you turn into the alcove) and the seating area will be the entire left of the store. You order, making sure to get a Neapolitan shake with your Double-Double and head to your left to fill up the ketchup tubs (no pickled peppers because this isn't California) before taking a seat on the benches which will be just in front of you. Don't worry about the soda fountain, which will be to your left, along the wall that's adjacent to the drive-thru, as you have a milk shake coming. When they call your order (Number 79, I believe), you go to the counter and find yourself a seat...but you can't have both a window and a booth. Should you want a window seat, you'll have to choose from the hard seats that are set up as two-seater tables, some which are bundled with others. You could eat outside, but this is Arizona, so I wouldn't recommend that. Upon finishing your burger, you should toss the garbage either by the secondary entrance or by the ketchup dispenser.  That is the restaurant layout and your experience, neither of which ever changes."}
{"text":"I have to say this is the worst food i have had in a long time.  I couldn't even finish it.   All the hype is bull shit!"}
{"text":"I love In & Out burgers! Hell its the only burger I will eat when out. All I can rate them on is the performance of their food preparation. I don't know what's wrong with this location but they have a tendency to mess up every single order I have placed in the last month. I don't know if they are under new management and the manager doesn't care about who he is hiring but I am completely turned off. They are rude, they can't take simple order down, and if the succeed at taking it down right then their food prep staff messes it up every single time. I called to complain directly but was transferred to a call center who addressed their horrible service with a \"Dine with Us\"  We used the dine with us and again had a horrible experience. They can't get their orders correct ever. Worst In and Out and I have been to many many of them in this state and every where in California.   I highly recommend yelping and then calling their call center. Let's get the people who shouldn't be employed out of this place.   Don't even get me started on their drive they times 20mins with 3 cars. They should see how stores in Cali handle crowds of people and what seems like on most days never ending line of cars. 20mins is absolutely ridiculous for this location especially when there's only a handful of people inside and about 3-4 cars in the drive-thru. Step up your game.   Flipping burgers is not rocket science."}
{"text":"If you have a car, drive that extra 5-10 minutes and find another In-N-Out further away from the Strip. It's not really this place's fault that I gave it 3-stars, but I am doing so in comparison to its sister locations in Las Vegas. The service is ok here, but it's just way overcrowded because this is the location closest to the Strip. Cabs and Uber cars are constantly stopping in the middle of the lot to drop off and pick up passengers, and the wait for food is long... extremely long for a 'fast food' joint. We waited 20-25 minutes for 3 cheeseburgers, one order of fries and one shake. Not sure how clean the place can get even with the staff trying to stay on top if given its popularity. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"So I have heard all the hype of In-N-Out that I knew I had to add this to list since I live on the east coast. I think for me total experience was decent the burger was definitely good the fries were nothing to die over. Partially I think I came in with high expectations so I may be little biased. Also in defense I ordered to go and didn't taste the fries until then so they were cold.  I ordered the double double and animal fries. The wait wasn't too bad as it was packed. Staff was friendly as well.  I will definitely give it another shot and perhaps give it the 4 or 5 stars everyone thinks it is."}
{"text":"Just when you thought there were enough In-N-Out burgers in Las Vegas, another one appears!  A shiny new oasis in the desert of North Las Vegas, which has rapidly increased the sale of scales in the area.  The same delicious food, same secret menu. Not to be missed."}
{"text":"Animal Style all the way!  If you don t know the secret menu your missing out :)"}
{"text":"Well this is one of my favorite fast food joints around. When I lived in California we had them on every corner. After I moved to Az I was just happy to have one in town. This location is super busy but always consistent and they can handle the crowds. There is outdoor seating available which is not really usable during the hellish heat months but nice when it cools down a bit. Being in the South I am really missing my Double Double with extra onions. Sigh.... If you've never been here do yourself a favor and stop in. You will be a lifer"}
{"text":"Always delicious. I don't think I have ever been disappointed with any experience at any In-N-Out burger. And the customer service can't be beat for a drive thru!"}
{"text":"Worst in-n-out ever. The staff was very friendly however the food was a disaster. The burgers were dry, and the fries tasted like week old cardboard.   We ordered fries animal style and the sauce was dried on top of the fries as if it was made long before. The staff was very nice and gave me new fries; but they were still terrible.   We ended up throwing it away. Maybe because this is a tourist-area, they've lost the quality aspect but definitely skip it.   Not worth the trip at all."}
{"text":"Food is consistently good, staff is consistently polite and friendly. Great price. Very busy place. Sometimes the wait can be a bit long for fast-food because of how popular it is."}
{"text":"Fresh, fast and tasty!!!  I like my burger with grilled onions, lettuce, tomatoes and cheese!!! The staff is always tidy and waring white. They are friendly. I have eaten at various locations,  but this one was open very late one night after a gig, thank goodness. .. still hot and yummy!"}
{"text":"What's not to love about In and Out?   I'm rating 5 stars for In and Out's food!!  I can honestly say I can eat healthy and not feel guilty when I eat here.  If you're unsure about their nutrition facts, just google it.    Service is pretty good and quick.  They have a 100% satisfaction guarantee."}
{"text":"Monday night, the hunger was outlandish, 12:58am, 2 minutes before closing time and was able to make the last order of the night. The staff members were amazing specially for the manager that night, who we had asked if the big safety pins were something that could be purchased. A gentlemen  educated us on where to get one and seemed very knowledgeable in what he does. And by surprise he went out his way and handed us his safety pin that he took from his personal apron. That completely made our night. Asides from the amazing costumer service the food was fresh off the the grill and satisfying as alwasls. Thanks manager om duty tha night! You know who you are and you rock! Keep being genuine!"}
{"text":"Brand spanking new location. Same as any though. For fast food, it's the best chain. I love how they make their potatoes right in front of you- fresh, not frozen. And for veggietarians like me, there's the grill cheese option. Don't let your friends make fun of you. Remind them that their heart will fail sooner than yours."}
{"text":"No fast food joint deserves to exist. But In-N-Out does. Their fries are legit potatoes sliced and fried right in front of you, in non-life-threatening oil. They have a great veggie option- grill cheese (with lettuce, tomato, and spread). Ridiculously cheap too. Always friendly and lively staff."}
{"text":"Did I really just give 5 stars to a fast food joint? Yes I sure did. Like your first love in high school, I fell hard and fast for In n Out over a decade ago and always make it a point to search out and enjoy this yummy goodness. As I'm living in the Midwest now, my opportunities to seek out and enjoy In n Out are few and far between.   I won't be saying anything that hasn't already been said before about this place, but say it I must. The simplicity of the menu had me doubtful during my first visit, but I quickly found out that when you do something good, you don't have to offer a ton of different things. Although I have learned that there is quite an extensive menu that they will offer upon request. A simple Goggle search and you will see what I mean.   The burgers are good here, but for me the best and most anticipated part of the visit is the fries. I could literally eat these fries all day long and not get sick of them. Yes, this is a chain restaurant, a fast food joint no less, but for me, it just doesn't get any better than this."}
{"text":"Friendly service and great tasting food! I can never have too much in n out. Was glad to see this close to my hotel after a long drive."}
{"text":"What can I say? It's In N Out and it's right by the Vegas strip. What's not to like? Fast and friendly service as always."}
{"text":"It's a bit of a grease bomb but the consistency of their food is a lot on every time my family and I stop by regardless of the location."}
{"text":"No banana peppers really. Keep up Cali. As they come from California. No one knows what's the deal but still 5 stars. The best burger place......."}
{"text":"I love that this location is literally in the middle of the strip. Their service is still so fast, and the staff was so awesome. Yes, it's your typical drunk food stop, and it was certainly PACKED to the max, but still, the food came out so quickly. I'd love to see their hours extended past 3 AM because we went right as they were closing. They're located by some big bars so it'd be great to see them open longer because I know they'd get business. Order your burgers animal style to get some pickles and chopped, grilled onions!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. Fresh ingredients, great prices, probably one of the BEST values for a burger in Vegas.  Other than that... I have to point out that the lines in the drive thru and inside are always staggering during the afternoon and later.  I'd only suggest going here if you have a lot of patience. I've spent upwards of 20 minutes in the drive thru line before."}
{"text":"Always a great experience when you bite into one of these burgers. The employees are super friendly and the food is always delicious. My kids love them and love getting a hat too. High quality fast food that doesn't leave you in regret when you are done eating it. Mmm...I'm craving one right now."}
{"text":"UNSANITARY  Normally In-N-Out is great.  When my wife and I visited this location on 2-9-13. We had to leave halfway through the order! While I was deciding what to order, a worker wearing gloves brought out a tray of food to a customer's table and then she came over to the register and started taking our order. Halfway thru the order, another girl came and took over to finish typing it into the register. The girl that had been touching dirty plastic trays and typing on the dirty register then went back and started assembling a hamburger for someone while wearing the same gloves. I don't have OCD but I can't stand it when a worker is wearing gloves to prepare food and then touching other things (register keypads, serving trays). Why even wear gloves at all?"}
{"text":"Love the food! People are super friendly. Nothing to complain about. I always get the protein style because I can't eat gluten and it's amazing. They somehow wrap it up so I can actually enjoy a burger and not have it fall apart on me. I've been coming to this location for 4+ years. They're great!"}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out Burger! I usually go to their locations in California...I was very happy to see one here in Vegas!  This particular location was super crowded, but my food was ready pretty quickly! I ordered the double double with fries and it was good as always! I'd come back to this location again!"}
{"text":"My husband is eating it right now. He gives it a 5, but I say 4 because they forgot his ketchup. Best burger joint around. Very quick through the drive thru!"}
{"text":"I was vegan for 1 and 1/2 years until I recently relapsed. I think that America's obsession with red meat and deep fried carbohydrates is the reason why we're all fat. I'm also aware that fully 18% of all greenhouses gasses come from the feed, transport, and processing of animal products. Why then do I give In-N-Out four stars? Because they're different. They have a secret menu. They pay their employees well. Their food is fresh. They refuse to change their menu or advertise on TV. They don't try to seduce your kids with plastic toys. Of all the \"Burger Barn\" fast food joints you can pig out at In-N-Out is by far the least evil. So eat up! Four stars because I always leave there in a food induced coma."}
{"text":"I'm becoming less and less impressed with In-N-Out. Being from Illinois I originally thought this was the greatest fast food I had ever tried when I came out to Arizona and had it for the first time, although now I wonder if it is even much better if at all than the likes of Wendy's, Burger King, etc.  The burger really isn't all it is hyped up to be once you have had it a few times. The fries are worse than most other fast food places, so they try to give you a bunch to make up for that.  It's probably the coolest looking fast food place though and the employees wear neat uniforms. This particular location gets really crowded, so you may want to go at a good time to actually get a table. The food is pretty good, but after you have had it a few times you start to realize it's not as great as you originally thought."}
{"text":"Always love this place! It is a must when I'm on the west coast. I got a double with chopped Chile's and fries, regular. It was all so amazing I could eat it once a week at least. They do have some of the best milkshakes as well"}
{"text":"Amazing as always, I live for the double double animal style. If you don't like the fries as is, order them extra crispy."}
{"text":"Best fast food burger by far! I have never gotten a bad meal from here. This location is always packed but they don't keep you waiting too long for your order. Friendly staff at every location I've been too"}
{"text":"In Las Vegas for a day and needed a fix of my California favorite, actually just a root beer float, so I ordered a large root beer float.  She charged me for a large root beer float and I got a regular sized cup float which was 3/4 full.  I asked for a large one when my order came out, the server said they don't make large cups for shakes.  Why charge me extra for a smaller cup and tell me you can't do anything about it?  Surprised with the service at this location, I hold In-N-Out at a higher standard because I'm a  Southern California local and they have always rectified my order with no question.  Disappointed with this In-N-Out for not going out of their way as they usually do.  Glad I'm going back back back to Cali.  Mick.  One."}
{"text":"There must be some mistake! How have I not reviewed this In-N-Out?  While not technically the first or only In-N-Out i've been to, I've certainly been to this one the most.  It's pretty much always busy, but they move the line along quickly.  I don't know what the secret to this burger is.  Chances are you can make a better burger at home, but at the same time there is something that makes me try and make this my first stop whenever I'm in Las Vegas.  So the bottom line is, it's all about the In-N-Out love.  Good consistant quality that is extra delicious for an out of towner."}
{"text":"By far the best fast food burger around.   Consistently good burgers and reasonable prices.  A go-to, fast option for my family."}
{"text":"Walked 1.5 miles from the QUAD or former Imperial Palace at the Strip all the way here just so that I can try In N Out on my last night in Vegas!! I would say it was soo worth it!! At first I was hesitant to walk here because when you search on Google maps, you basically see that it's located near a highway and think it's not pedestrian friendly and may not be safe. However, there IS an underpass (??) for pedestrians to get here...although definitely NOT kid-friendly.   ***TIP***  To get here, you should stay on the side of the Excalibur hotel  Anyways, I got two Double Double, Fries (Animal Style!!) and a large Neopolitan Shake. It was EXTREMELY busy but the staff were friendly, pleasant, and VERY hardworking. Finally got my food, bit into it, and I thought WOW~ I think I just bit into one of the best tasting burgers I've ever had in America!! I would say compared to Shake Shack, In-N-Out burgers are scrumptious and they taste MUCH fresh and their fries are cut small, not super-oily, and are filling. Their shake was SUPER thick and tasty as well!! After you finish your shake, you can use the same cup to get a refill on the soda machine so be sure to get the shake instead of the soft drink so you can get both!! :)  Wish In-N-Out makes a debut in NYC sometime to compete with Shake Shack just like Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf did to compete with Starbucks..."}
{"text":"Get in my belly!!!  I could eat this everyday and not get tired of it!  We had some newbies in the group and the staff was extremely friendly in explaining all of the toppings that go on top of the burgers.   We had 5 burgers, 4 fries, and a shake, all for $21! Delicious and cheap? That is my kinda place!  The place is also spotless and I like that try make their fries from scratch. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Melisa the manager is amazing. I am celiac and Place was packed. She made sure that my food was prepared safely for me so I wouldn't get sick!"}
{"text":"So very happy to have an In N Out in Surprise now... our city is growing so much, but yet so dangerous to have here for In N Out lovers!   The drive thru set up is absolutely insane and the likelihood to get hit by a car in pretty high.  Should have rethought those entrances.   All experiences have been positive this far... first time ordering off secret menu of grilled cheese, we asked for just a grilled cheese only and it had lettuce, tomato and sauce on it.  Told us I would have to come in to have it remade.  Wasn't bring three starving kids into the packed standing room only store. Another night around 10:30, went in and ordered a cheese burger, ketchup and grilled onions, verified that it would not anything else but those items on it.  After the 10 minute wait, the burger was wrong.  It was a training issue and the cashier was asked to insure he understood, as he was taking the current persons order wrong.  LOL. It was fixed within 5 minutes.    Otherwise the place is very very clean, wish the stores would have a bigger building for more seating.  During lunch/dinner crowds it's impossible to get seats for a family.  And sitting outside in 115 degree heat is not fun to eat in."}
{"text":"Their #3 combo is a better deal that you can get at that over priced Chik-fil-a and more filling!!!"}
{"text":"Last year when I went to Vegas I tried to go to In-n-Out and there were 7 bus loads of military personnel there.  Needless to say the line was way out the door and people were sitting everywhere and anywhere.  I was restricted in time so had to pass : - (  So when I went back to Vegas this year, In-n-Out was planned for early in the trip.  Line was still near the door, but stood in line and ordered my double double meai.  I enjoyed my burger & fries and also the entertainment.  Instead of sitting at a table I sat at the counter like tables where I had a front row seat to watch all the action.  It's amazing how many workers they have and they all have a specific job so that we can get our meals fast.  Watched the never ending line of people order & get their food.  Crazy busy, but that just shows you how much people love their In-n-Out Burgers.  They have a simple concept and they do it right and for the right price too.  awesome!!"}
{"text":"I believe this is the busiest In-N-Out Burger in town, and we have several in Las Vegas. It's cool that they have a \"secret menu\".  The bottom line is that the burgers here a very good but I had to deduct one star because they don't offer mayonnaise. I just don't get that! Maybe they think mayo is unhealthy but what are burgers and fries? haha  If you don't care about mayo, this is your place. A fairly simple menu (like the original McDonald's). They keep the place clean, too.  The one on Sahara is less busy but the same good food."}
{"text":"Finally got to try In-N-Out, as there are not any here in the Midwest. We dined in and didn't have to wait long to order or to get our food despite it being dinnertime on a Friday night. I had the single hamburger and fries. Buttery bun, just greasy enough burger and fries. Great portions. I wish I would have ordered a milkshake to go! Clean, friendly, classic."}
{"text":"Double-Double grilled onions and cheese fries. This location is always consistent, fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Pretty busy place even close to midnight but  they work fast and you will get your tasty burgers fast!"}
{"text":"Nicest staff you could ever want.  It was late and they were busy, order was perfect.  A little over kill on the sauce otherwise would have gotten 5 stars."}
{"text":"It's alright nothing to get excited about. I've heard so much about this place, we don't have it on the east coast where I live. When we got to Vegas I was determined to try it but I was disappointed. The The food looked super good but when I bit into it I thought to myself 'I can make a better burger at home'. You get what you pay for its a simple place with a simple menu."}
{"text":"Not sure why everyone loves this place. Hamburgers are some of my all time favorite food. When I was younger I only ate in n out about every 5 months because the closest one was 2 hours away and would only eat it when I visited my aunt. I moved to a different state and now have in n out 5 minutes away from me.  I went super excited and bought a burger and the animal fries..I believe that's what their called? The hamburger was just a plain normal hamburger. Nothing special. And the fries were nasty. I thought it might have been just that day.  So I tried it again an again and again. Nope. None of them were any special.  I hear how wonderful and delicious these hamburgers are but they are just normal. They aren't bad. Not at all. They are pretty good but nothing special."}
{"text":"I'm not a big burger fan, but when I do crave burgers, In n Out is the way to go! This place is still my favorite burger fast food joint! Price is good and quality is even better!"}
{"text":"You know I've been a HUGE fan of In n Out burger for YEARS.....been to 15 or so in so cal, both in Reno, the one down the street from The Excalibur in Vegas, and have ALWAYS enjoyed my visit!!! Well....that streak came to a SCREECHING halt when we decided to try the new location in Vegas. They \"lost\" our order, the food was cold when we finally did get it, and the \"animal style\", which is usually how I order both my double double, and fries, was HORRIBLE. Just to make this clear, I'm a HUGE fan of In n Out burger, NOT at all a fan of this new location. SAD very very SAD."}
{"text":"This is my mom's go to spot in Vegas but this visit brought disappointment. She wasn't sure if the recipe changed or the burger got smaller and the amount of lettuce increased but she said it wasn't as good. As for the fries, they weren't fresh and weren't anything to boast about. Why does everyone rave about this burger chain? I just don't get it."}
{"text":"Great food, good service. Love the place! Employees are friendly and fast! I would recommend this restaurant to everone!"}
{"text":"2 double doubles with onion.  vanilla shake.  good night !!"}
{"text":"Simply the best burger place with great customer service!  No other fast food restaurant employees treat u with great service like here.  Will come back many times!"}
{"text":"I FINALLY TRIED IN-N-OUT BURGER!! I went to Vegas for my birthday and lo and behold there was an In-N-Out Burger down the street from my hotel. This particular location is in between Harrah's and the Linq hotels. I got there around 2AM and I was surprised that it was not packed. The inside is well lit and looks very clean. The menu is extremely small which I thought would mean faster service. Thankfully my friend ordered for me and I got a double animal style with animal style fries. Animal style means thousand island dressing with grilled onions. The burger was delicious! Nice toasted bun, crispy lettuce, perfectly grilled onions, on top of melted cheese on a grilled meat patty. I was more blown away by it at 2AM than at 7PM the next night. The staff was very friendly and patient. They have a ketchup and hot pepper station which I loved because those are two of my favorite things to add to my burger! Now the fries also came animal style. Thankfully because they were not seasoned and were like thin straw fries. Not a fan of those. All in all, the burgers were pretty good but I was not blown away. I'll stick to 5 Guys or even Cookout."}
{"text":"first impressions after getting out of the car:  \"What is that awful smell!  It smells like the sewer is backed up out here!\"  Not how it smelled when we walked into the place though.  We were greeted by an eager young man looking to make sure we were well taken care of.    My bride & I placed our orders and searched for a clean place to sit down...  \"Clean\" is the operative word.  It seems the guests are sloppy, so we asked the previously mentioned young man to clean a table (and seats) for us, and he gladly did so.  The burgers were tasty, the fries were as expected.    My first time at an in & out burger, and I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised.  Good value, tasty food - probably not very good FOR me though.  I'm sure my arteries will complain later."}
{"text":"Only place I eat onions that aren't in ring form.  Can't go wrong with animal style burgers or fries.  And just in case you fear a bit of onion breath lol simply go with the island style fries and burgers.  Good place to grab a bite and enjoy an inexpensive meal amongst friends.    Funny I like this place because of the old timey, 1950's-60's vibe...  Be forewarned, great place to YouTube yourself with one of their challenges.  Try a 10x10, 20x20 if you cray..."}
{"text":"Best burgers and great customer service.  Animal style EVERYTHING w a neopolitan shake!!!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong here! My usual is a protein burger with two patties and whole grilled onion. The whole grilled onion is way better than the chopped filled with grease onion.  For fries, I usually get cheese on the top. Yes ladies and gents, it's cheese fries LOL  99% of the time they get it right. Then there's that 1% the patty is super dry and YUCK!"}
{"text":"It's In-N-Out, and it doesn't get better than this location. Consistently great service (except for last night in the drive-thru, when they gave us banana peppers instead of spread... that was weird) and consistently great food. One of the safest food choices in Tempe!"}
{"text":"When a place like in n out has such a small menu you expect the food to be hot and fresh. My fries were just sitting on the counter getting cold waiting for the burgers to finish. When I get my food my fries were cold. Really.... never again will I go to this location."}
{"text":"We all Know In-N-Out is a troll name for this place.  Should be called Slow-U-Wait.  But Its a great simple burger joint with awesome fries sauce and customer service.  Its not the best but it NEVER lets me down."}
{"text":"Best service in the state! Great food.  They all have the same high standards."}
{"text":"Best service in the state! Great food.  They all have the same high standards."}
{"text":"My son loves this place so we stopped by for a quick bite to eat. Food is always consistent here and it always taste fresh. Service is always courteous and prompt. This evening we sat at the counter top to enjoy our meal and watched the crew working during a mad rush. It amazes me how cool and collected each were even though it was non-stop busy. Watched with great amusement as shift leader (Chad) dealt with customer's crazy requests and complaints... but he handled each one with grace.  You have great group of workers here. We will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's been forever since I've had this place and decided to have some today. Since I had no breakfast I went about 11:30am and of course there was a line starting to form already. I ordered a double double (greedy) with grilled onions and a lemonade. Sat in line for a little bit (not long) but when I made it to the first window the heffa was really rude to me. Before I could even get my card & receipt back the heffa slammed the window on me. Not that I needed anything but she was RUDE!!! Never said hello, thank you, or anything. I usually give these people a little break cuz I know we all have bad days but to customers who help you stay employed is totally unacceptable!!! Put your happy face on and suck it up you have a job to do.   When I pulled up to the 2nd window the young lady was very nice, personable, pleasant, and didn't necessarily rush me off & slam the window on me. But that didn't make up for the heffa being rude to me initially.   Now onto the food.....My double double was amazing as expected and just outstanding. My fries were a bit soggy but they were hot, fresh, and good. My lemonade was perfect also not watered down & I could actually taste it. Probably will go back in the future but the young lady working the first window definitely needed an attitude adjustment!!!  We all have bad days but the people you're servicing should NEVER EVER know that. When I have bad days you better believe our patients, doctors, and nurses will never know it. And the others never know unless I tell them or can sense it cuz they're around me everyday. I hate hate hate receiving bad service or feel like somebody is being rude or short with me. I treat you like I want to be treated so I would like the same done to me!!!!!  Enough of my rant so that's why I only have 3 stars instead of 4. Good was great but service was blah."}
{"text":"After moving from California to New York 8 months ago, I've had to deal with the complete lack of In-N-Out deliciousness.  Sure New York has plenty of great alternatives, but nothing is a replacement for In-N-Out.  There's not much to say about this particular location... except its nice and close to the airport and the two times I went there was almost no line (which I've never experienced in CA).  VEGETARIANS:  Order a \"Grilled Cheese Animal Style\" and some fries and you're set!"}
{"text":"OMG, these are possibly THE BEST fast food burgers I have EVER tasted!  They do burgers simple, cheap and oh so well!!  They even cut them in half for you!  Chips are awesome too!  I wish I had one near me....although prob not a good thing...would always be eating burgers! Staff are oh so friendly in that 'I am so pleased to see you, enjoy your meal & have a great day' way!!  Yes, if in The States (California/Las Vegas - not sure where else) Do it!!! GO on, you'll luv them!!!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Las Vegas for our anniversary in November 2015. Saw this and wanted to stop by. The burgers were good. Service was fast. Didn't care for the fries."}
{"text":"I never thought I would live close to a IN/OUT Burger and now I do. The service is allways over the top. The food is allways fresh you couldn't ask much more from a burger place."}
{"text":"In n out continues to rank very high on my favorite burger joints and this location did not let me down.  I went all out for this one on a layover from the Vegas airport about 3 miles away. I had the double double burger animal style, fries animal style and the chocolate shake. I had to load up since I don't know when I'll ever see another in n out being from the east coast. I think next time I'll hold off on the animal style burger since the onions have a tendency to dominate the flavor over the meat , cheese and bun. But for a total price of $10 you can't beat it. I went to chow town on this meal for realz!"}
{"text":"Moved away from In-N-Out to Colorado and this was literally the first stop I made once we landed in Vegas. Get a burger, of course, and make it animal style. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love In-N-Out?! I don't think I will ever get tired of this place.  In-N-Out is delicious, fast, and affordable.  Their meat to bun ratio is off, so I always get a double-double.  Their buns are toasted to perfection!  I also upgrade my fries to cheese fries, although they charge you $3 for a slice of cheese.  This doesn't line up with the rest of their menu being affordable, but whatever..  Ask for a Neapolitan shake!  They will blend vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry all in one.  Service here is ALWAYS exceptional.  The cashiers repeat back your order and are some of the friendliest I've met."}
{"text":"I always love In N Out, but I was especially pleased with this location! We went at 12:30am, expecting the employees to be tired, but instead, our cashier (Garrett) was enthusiastic, comedic, and very friendly!! Thanks to him we will be sure to always come back to this location"}
{"text":"I love in n out. A great place to grab a bite before you jump on the road to leave Vegas if you want to avoid the buffets and crowds and traffic that follow after your dining experience. It is always crowded so be prepared to wait in line for 15 minutes!"}
{"text":"Gregg was helpful and patient with our ordering.  Glad this place was open late after arriving here in Phoenix so late at night. As always the food was good and the menu was simple for easy ordering and takeout."}
{"text":"Can you say Hell Ya!  I have heard about IN-N-OUT for years, I finally got my chance to be part of the masses and willingly submit my soul to the cult of IN-N-OUT!  I snuck out the hotel room while here in Glendale, it was under the guise to get some juice and waters etc. honestly I didn't want to take Twinkee with me since she is competing in a meet here and eating a double in front of her and then telling her she cant have none, could be in some circles considered child abuse.  Honestly the best burgers I have ever had use a simple recipe, good ingredients. IN-N-OUT has this down to a science. The double was perfect, nice amounts of melted gooey cheese, fresh tomato, onion IN-N-OUT sauce this is a burger that could be considered appropriate for every meal. The fries are fresh cut, crispy and nicely salted and I love the fact the wrapper of the burger and the boat the fries are served in are plastered with facts and IN-N-OUT rhetoric further drawing you into the grasp of this cult.   The little red serving trays are the some cool little pieces of plastic, they have dudes coming around cleaning up and picking up the trays or I would probably of had 3 new souvenirs.  IN-N-OUT when I am in a city your in I am there!"}
{"text":"Great staff and burgers. You gotta get the double double, fries, and a black and white shake."}
{"text":"This applies to the entire In and Out chain, not just this location: On the plus side, restaurant is very clean, staff is super polite and efficient, fresh delicious lettuce onion and tomato on the burger, meat similar to White Castle (I consider that a plus, anyway), and the cheese is duly melted which beats most McDonald's today.   Yet the downsides are damning: Their buns and their french fries are dried out and tasteless (McDonald's beats them hands down in both categories). But the WORST is this: Just like Five Guys and Smashburger, this \"new breed\" hamburger chain utterly defeats its core value proposition of a \"freshly made\" burger BY MAKING ALL OF THEM WELL DONE (and a few burned to a crisp)! This enables them to churn out orders faster because they don't have to deal with cooking orders differently. It also kills the taste of the burger for anyone who likes it cooked rare, medium rare or medium. I will not be back.  Fuddruckers is the ONLY burger chain that understands this and this makes hamburgers so you can actually TASTE the fresh meat flavor."}
{"text":"I dont know why oh why I keep returning to the scene of the crime!?  I am constantly disappointed with the food quality.  The fries are always over cooked, toasted, hard and inedible at this location. Why only THIS ino ??  the burgers are sloppy and not stacked correctly.  I'd rather just go to Five Guys right across the street.  ugh."}
{"text":"Love In-N-Out for what it is. It has made fast food even faster by simplifying its menu and streamlining service. It's always packed with people but you still get your food fast. Plus I really love the fact that there packaging and cups have scripture printed on them."}
{"text":"Us tourist from NYC arrived at this In/Out just before 11:00am on a Friday hoping to avoid any lines, and indeed we did. We got a chocolate shake, two singles and one double, with an order of fries (all animal style). We died and went to heaven."}
{"text":"in-and-out what can I say fast super friendly open late and the clean what else would you want from a drive"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed my visits to In-N-Out Burger. I generally don't vary my order at all: a Double-Double meal and it's satisfying each time. The burgers are big enough, juicy and tasty; a generous helping of fries and a drink. It's almost always busy, especially on weekends of course, but the wait isn't overly long and the staff has always been friendly. The food is consistently good. If you're in the mood for a good, fast-food meal that isn't your typical Mc'D's or BK stuff, this is a great option at really a reasonable price. Sit inside or out and grab a good burger."}
{"text":"when i go here my double double is always extra tasty as well as hot did go inside after eating in the parking lot on a nice summer evening and they're lemonade was bone dry"}
{"text":"Here on a late night . Something to soak up the alcohol line is moving slow reason for thee rating havent devoured as of yet . And im behind an annoying man in thee drive thru that wouldnt scoot up enough for me to speak in the order menu ......................................... Now that ive eaten  because \" im not myself when hungry\"  ... my fries were cooked way too long even thee animal style didnt help them and to top it off my burger had raw onion on it.... in all my yrs i never even considered or knew that they serve burgers wit raw onion ...ewww ! needless to say prolly did wonders covering up *holiday weekend breath* , not even considering i was headed toward the strip and could have stopped at thee one right off the freeway by the strip"}
{"text":"Placed a food order for dine in on May 31st, ordered a cheeseburger, two orders of fries, and a shake, but even after waiting twenty minutes, they didn't call my order out (when I checked on it, the associate didn't make the order, and asked if I wanted to wait while they made it (told them no) and left...was pretty busy on Thursday..."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always great and so is the service.  However,  today was not one of those days. I was they earlier during the 11:00 to 12:00 hour with my son  This is his favorite place. I asked the girl at the comfort and courtesy cup for water. She tell me oh well don't  have those. I pass the soda machine and  other that there is a  button for water. This really angered me. As I was sitting waiting for my food. I noticed an employee cleaning so I asked her. She said we do and went to retrieve a cup and brought it to me. How sweet and kind of her to tame a moment from cleaning to satisfy me. Even though it was extremely busy and she was trying to make sure that guest were a letter to sit. She found the time to please me. Why couldn't the girl who took my order do the same? She didn't have to go very far to very far to grab a cup for me too have water. The girl cleaning  the tables deserves to be recognized for going above and beyond."}
{"text":"I have to say the drive thru is insanely efficient, I am impressed. I waited in the drive thru and I happen to pick a day there was about 30 cars in line.  It moved so fast. You can see the staff thru the windows working their butts off. It took less than 15 min. And the food was perfect. Great job!!!!"}
{"text":"MMMMMM... drools on self. This place is just simple burger and fries at an awesome price. If you dont like it than you clearly have no soul. Try the animal fries..fatty goodness."}
{"text":"this is the third time I've ordered drive thru from this location asking specifically for a double double hamburger and they have given me a cheeseburger. most definitely my last straw"}
{"text":"great food. great service. get the double double animal style with animal style fries! perfection... and scripture on the bottom of ur cup! love it!"}
{"text":"Its in-n-out. Great fresh burgers and open late. Only problem is the wait in the drive thru late at night"}
{"text":"Convenient and inconvenient location off the 215 and eastern. Reason why I said convenient and inconvenient is because of its location. Convenient that its off the 215 and Eastern, but inconvenient for people like me picking up to go home after work. I mean, by the time I get off work, its not that bad, but still have to cut across eastern all the way to get on the 215.   Fast, hot service. Went drive through. Ordered a double double with pink lemonade, fries, and a side of spread. My usual order at in n out. Though I keep forgetting to ask for those peppers when im going drive-thru.   Can't complain too much. it's in n out. only complaint is ah oh so good but ah oh so bad XD"}
{"text":"I goddamn love In-N-Out.  Which is why it breaks my heart that this location is sloppy as hell.   If you don't like onions on your burger, skip this location because they will -90% of the time- get goddamned onions on your burgers.  I drive-thru with a friend who is allergic to onions, and they order their burger plain- meat cheese and bun. Seriously 9 out of 10 times, there are pieces of chopped onion all over their plain burger. In-N-Out takes pride in their quality and consistency but there's just not a lot of that happening here.   We've come back countless times and given them a million chances, and keep getting disappointed. Like come on, can't you take 5 seconds to scrape down the griddle a bit or change/wipe your gloves when making plain burgers?   Bummer."}
{"text":"Everything was great here!!! Food was fresh, hot and delicious! The place was clean and the employees were friendly. The only reason this place doesn't get a 5 from me is that I've had Five Guys and nothing can compare to their burgers and fries. Sorry In-N-Out!"}
{"text":"I love in-n-out burger, but who doesn't.  Great food, fast and just everything is good. Only problem I have had is that some times it is hard to find a place to sit.."}
{"text":"you guys the french fries are life. ball is not life. in n out burger fries are life. i fucking love your fries. if i get fat itll be off your fries i love you guys."}
{"text":"OK burgers, thin patties, but the not so secret secret menu is on line... order you fries \"well\" a bit more crispy in the frier  order the triple triple... three burgers with three cheese.  and animal style your fries."}
{"text":"I was excited to finally try the burgers here as we don't have them on the east coast. Sadly I just don't understand the hype. I was expecting the burgers to be super fresh and tasty... Maybe comparable to Shake Shack. They tasted like a slightly better version of any other fast food joint but not much. The meat patty was so thin it was almost non-existent. Fries weren't very tasty (and I love fries!!) and pretty greasy. The redeeming part was the delicious chocolate shake."}
{"text":"i have been a fan forever of in n out.  the burgers are always fresh and the fries are nothing but perfect!!! when they are crowded there is someone outside to take your order before you reach the window.  kudos for great customer service and awesome delicious food!!!!"}
{"text":"The wife and I have to go to In-N-Out at least twice a week for fries and shakes. It means more time in the pool and on the treadmill but it's worth it."}
{"text":"For us New Yorkers, in-n-out burger is somewhat of a mythical place - we hear about this imaginary land of burgers served animal style quite often, but never truly believe them to exist, until of course we're out west when we seek them out at all costs.  Such was the case on my trip to Arizona this past weekend where I emphatically told my wife I'd be having it for lunch one day with or without her.  Thankfully the experienced lived up to the hype - best burger I've ever had? no.  Best fast food burger? By a mile and half, these were damn near restaurant quality burgers being served up here.  The animal fries were also amazing.  Thanks to our helpful server who humored me throughout my process of giggling & asking for secret menu options - the only one he couldn't accomodate was cooking the burger medium rare, despite the reports online of this being possible, I was told that they can't undercook at all.  My requests for animal style burger & fries as well as having the fries well done and a neapolitan shake were all taken care of no sweat.  Super friendly staff, great grub & reasonable prices here - really can't wait to do it again!"}
{"text":"Amazingly, you can actually get a veggie burger here - just order a \"grilled cheese\" with whatever toppings you want on it.  Otherwise, I was just along for the ride with some coworkers when we arrived a little early for our conference and were looking for a place to eat."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place!  I have always wanted to try an In N Out burger, but living in the eastern part of the country that wasn't possible.  Finally my job brought me to Vegas where I was free to have my first Double Double!  Great place, very hectic and busy but a great vibe."}
{"text":"WTF? How does this dump rate a 4 star average. I've tried this place 3 times and each time I have been underwelmed. I've heard a lot of people talk reminicently of how great this place is but this has not been my experience.   In my experience, the place always seem dirty. The staff is not friendly at all, just trying to rush you along. The burger tasted like it was under a lamp for hours...   I'll say this, it was consistent as it was exactly like this all 3 times I went. This is fast food so my expectations weren't that high but I'd rather go to Carl's Jr. or Burger king before I would go here."}
{"text":"This is a great burger that is fresh and made right every time you order. The shakes and fries pair well with the \"animal style\" burger. The fries are tasty and the prices are reasonable. Go here with the family if you want quick and tasty food, that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with In-N-Out. It's probably my favorite place to grab a quick burger to-go besides Culver's. And that's a pretty bold statement coming in as a WI transplant (home of the Culver's Butterburger). They are consistently delicious every time. I have NEVER had a bad experience here. So happy to see more of these popping up all around PHX."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's me or not but I'm sensing that in n out burger quality is going down. I miss the juicy burgers that they used to have.  Service here was fast and the line wasn't that bad"}
{"text":"The secret is out   Service is always good. This place is always busy which is a good sign. Place is nice and clean just like any other In N Out I like in-N-out so much, i don't even have to try their secret menu. The basic cheeseburger fries and shake will always do the job for me. The perfect burger meal!  But for those that are not impressed with the regular menu there is a special menu that only few people know about, \"the famous secret menu\" (I know) and lucky for you I'm about to Wikileakit.   The 2x4: A burger with two beef patties and four slices of cheese. ( no need to visit The heart attack grill)   The animal style: A mustard cooked beef patty with pickles, cheese, spread, and grilled onions mixed on the grill and placed on top of your burger or fries.   The flying  Dutchman: Two beef patties and two slices of cheese  and nothing more.   The veggie burger: you go with your friends and eat waterer they don't want, onions tomatoes pickles or lettuce and is all free."}
{"text":"My first encounter with In-N-Out was as a high school junior, visiting colleges in sunny California. My relatives promised me to make a pit stop at In-N-Out before my flight back to NYC and my heart filled with hope as we pulled up to the parking lot just to see that it wasn't opened!   5 years later I returned to the In-N-Out in Vegas! I was a complete noob however - thinking that ordering a 2x2 animal style made me a In-N-Out insider. Boy was I wrong. When I returned a few months later I had my bombdiggity order ready:  *Well-Done animal style fries (Well done is a NECESSITY. Otherwise the fries legit become soggy messes under the special dressing + onions that look like bacon). *Extra toasted bun (always order the bun first), medium rare animal style single w/out pickles, w/ a whole grilled onion, cut in half. *Neapolitan Shake (Chocolate + Vanilla + Strawberry)   The wait was minimal as it was around 10:30-11PM on a Friday night. Probably took about 10 mins for our food (it's fresh, never frozen!). My only complaint was that the bun was kinda cold :( I also could have done without the shake (suuuuuper thick). Other that that the food was fabulous + the fact that it's so affordable makes In-N-Out a staple whenever I'm in the West Coast!  P.S. There are no cabs readily outside...but cabs do stream in on a regular basis. We had to wait maybe 3 minutes before one came through with more patrons =)"}
{"text":"I work with a pretty diverse crowd that comes from all over the country. I hear about In-and-Out burger all the time. I finally got to try it this weekend, and I have to say ... What are you people thinking!?!  This place is garbage. Like...I would rather have McDonald's than this any day of the week. The recommendation that I got was to order my fries wild/animal/whatever style. Apparently, this is part of their \"secret\" menu, although it's not so secret because every other person in the place had their fries this way.    The burger tastes kind of like a sonic burger, which isn't too bad but the sauce that comes on it is horrid. And those fries... Those disgusting fries. This goop that came on the fries with a bunch of diced onions completely ruined them.   At first, I went back up to the counter to ask for a fork to eat the fries. The place was slam packed, and the girl behind the counter was nice. The next time I went up was for ketchup... Still nice but with a mix of \"you're an annoying customer\". Whatever, I didn't care.   I said this place was packed. The only place available to sit was at the bar style, long table. I had a front row seat to watch the kids yell out people's order numbers. God forbid that someone didn't pick up their order within 10 seconds. The whole crew would start screaming bloody murder. 87!!  Order 87!!!!  87!!!!!!!!!!!    Bottom line - if you've eaten here, you know what to expect. If you've never been, keep driving to pretty much ANY other burger joint."}
{"text":"What can I say just another In and Out Burger except this one was a little slow even though there's really nobody in there not sure what was going on the burger was good same as everywhere else"}
{"text":"Those are good burgers dude.  Listening to Creedence while enjoying these tasty burgers only enhances the flavor. Mind if I do a J?"}
{"text":"Good - people come quickly in waves (\"In-N-Out\"). College town atmosphere - loud and busy. Milkshakes are great! Can become a *bit* messy - was never distracting or uncomfortable."}
{"text":"You know the drill, menu is not extensive, although there is a not-so-secret menu. I enjoy my #2, grilled onions instead of regular. I'm sure we all have our favorites.  This specific location though, one of the cleanest In-N-Outs in town. So I definitely am a fan. :)"}
{"text":"Always. Packed.   Parking & getting out seems to be a hassle when it's rush hour but anything for beloved In-N-Out burger. :)"}
{"text":"Clean & very Friendly Staff! ordered the famous \"In-N-Out\" Cheese-burger, Fries & medium Root Beer for $5.79! WOW! the only drawback the food took 15 mins to get! otherwise the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Must say my favorite hamburger joint! Too bad I have not seen one of these franchises on the East Coast! Very friendly staff! Easy to read menu! Price cannot be beat for the Food I had ordered! I timed that food was delivered exactly in 10 mins"}
{"text":"I'm giving In-N-Out Burger 4-stars because it does what it's supposed to do - provides good burgers and fries.  But I've been to at least three In-N-Outs now in my lifetime (I live in Indiana, so we don't have them) and I still don't understand what all the fuss is about.  It's certainly better than McDonalds, but it's basically the same level as a Five Guys or a Steak n Shake.  Higher end (but not quite gourmet) burger places.  I almost gave it a 3-star just because it doesn't meet the hype level everyone places on it, but that seems unfair.  If you want a great burger, go here.  If you need to do it because you've always heard about it, go here.  But don't make the trip because you expect some mecca of burgers - you'll be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE In-N-Out Burger, so why the 3 stars?  This location has the food that we've all grown to love from In-N-Out, so it's not that (5-stars for fast food). It's just this particular location. If you're staying on the Strip and have a car, then you can get here rather easily. If you try to walk, grab a water bottle and maybe a Cliff bar because you're in for a hike. There is a path that gets you here, but it takes forever. I wish they could have located on the Strip someplace instead. I guess you could take a cab, but then you're basically jacking up the price of your burger.  But because it's within cab distance and easy driving distance, this location is PACKED. I mean, beyond what a normal packed In-N-Out is like. This created quite the messy restaurant. Parking looked to be a disaster as well. I will say that the service was amazing, as they were churning out burgers, fries, and whatnot like a tornado - yet the quality was still there.  Will these things keep me from going to this location the next time I'm in Vegas? No, because I don't have an In-N-Out where I live and I'm not going to let that opportunity pass me by. But the simple fact remains that this location tests your patience (even though it's worth it)."}
{"text":"In and out enough said. Place gets packed right next to the college"}
{"text":"Great cheap quality fod. This place gets packed fast!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food normally, please try to make sure your fries are crisp before you serves them"}
{"text":"In-N-Out, In-N-Out, my favorite burger in the world.  Let's be honest, I haven't tried every burger in the world. There might even be a better burgers elsewhere in the world that I haven't tried yet, haven't.. but would like to some day. That is always a possibility. But from here on out, I stand by what I said.  In-N-Out has been around for a long time. But while their contemporaries chose a different route, including the ones with the golden arches, to sell out to the man, In-N-Out said that people deserve quality. They deserves our BEST. That's what I'm talking about people. Creating a fresh, tasty burger, with fresh ingredients. It's not something that should be frozen and then reheated in a microwave. It's all about doing things the right way, and it shows by their massive, cult following.  Buns. I like big buns, and I cannot lie. You other brothers can't deny. In-N-Out has great buns. They don't get too squishy when you bite into them, but they aren't dry either. The meat. Never frozen. NEVER. It makes a huge difference in terms of the moistness of said patty. The cheese is underrated at In-N-Out, they use a cheese that taste like 100% dairy. And, come on. Special sauce? Yeah, I'm about that. Just pour it all over, man, all over babay. Fries? I like em well done, but that's just how I roll. Like an Animal.  You can't really beat the prices for what you pay for. The employees are really friendly. I wouldn't even take a star away if it was crazily busy all the time. I would not be able to in good conscious, considering everything that is involved.I will forever love the burgers from In-N-Out, my first one was life-changing, and my last meal will always be a Double Double, Animal Style."}
{"text":"I know there were others before me in the diner, but 15 mins for JUST cheese fries? :/"}
{"text":"Always delicious, always consistent.  This location was extra friendly on a busy Saturday night. The nicest server gave our two year old a hat and stickers which made her first in n out experience a memorable one."}
{"text":"In and Out burger...what can I say.  Goes down well, comes out easy.  Secret menu allows you to stretch beyond the mediocre 6 item menu.  Burgers are decent.  Quite frankly I think they are over-hyped.  The chain has an almost cult-like following.  Not sure that is warranted.  Definitely better than typical fast food joints, but it is just that...fast food.  Animal fries (aka chili cheese fries) pretty good.  Burgers are fresh.  Fries decent.     Always use drive-thru.  Line looks deceiving long hit moves quicker than shorter line inside.   Worth checking out if in a hurry but not my go to place for a quick meal."}
{"text":"I grew up on In N Out in California - and have loved it for years. This location is close to work and I come here infrequently.   Just like most locations, it's always consistent and good. I like getting whole grilled onions on a cheeseburger or double.   Employees are always friendly - never had a bad experience. There's very few places I can say that about. Mmm-mmmmmomma."}
{"text":"Food is good, not healthy but good! If your thinking of going into business, model yourself after them. They have friendly staff, clean everything, and quality foods...I have never seen a nicer staff! I have eaten there for years (in and out)..."}
{"text":"Where do these people find such great personality's??? I mean the people that work there are overly nice...are these former zappo and apple employees??? Do these people get paid A LOT more than McDonald's ? I think they have a paddle and a belt in the back beating the s*** out of people..."}
{"text":"Tasty, cheap, quick, and fresh. I like getting the cheeseburger with whole grilled onion and extra tomato. Shakes are also yummy and if you're looking for a diet splurge, try the animal style fries. Cheese, chopped grilled onions, and thousand island-esque sauce on the fries.  It's too bad in-n-out isn't nation wide."}
{"text":"$2.77.  One single cheeseburger with grilled onions only runs me $2.77.  It doesn't matter if I'm grabbing In N Out for lunch, dinner or a late-night snack.  The burgers are always, always fresh, non-greasy, just delicious.  Possibly the most consistent burger I've ever had.  Great service at every single location in the valley.  So much better than Smashburger and Five Guys ... So much better!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience, food, and value anywhere you go.  We came here at the spur of the moment after learning that they were here.  I've been to many in the L.A. area this one is just as good.  The wait took awhile but there's a constant stream of people coming to eat.  it's not entirely walkable from the strip as most people simply drive or cab it, but it is possible.  Had two double doubles and fries animal style!  Yum!"}
{"text":"I go to Vegas at least once a year for work, so when I do, I make a point to visit In-N-Out Burger. This location is close to the strip so it is easily accessible by taxi or Uber. This location gets quite rowdy and packed but the servers are very efficient and work hard get the food out quickly. My go to order is a double double animal style with fries and if I have room a vanilla milkshake for dessert. The quality of food is always consistent and the burger come out great every time I have come here."}
{"text":"I work at the nearby Lowes. I eat here just about every other day.  This is the rock in my life. Always good, always prompt and always nice.  My only suggestion is to provide more seats during the lunch rush, but that's nothing they can help. Why did I even mention it? Gotta make this review longer than 2 lines.  Great representation of the I-N-Out franchise.   Pigeons like fries."}
{"text":"No In-N-Out in Oregon.  Which is probably a good thing, or I'd be weighing in around 3 bills right now.  When I visit the Southwest, a trip to In-N-Out is always a must.  For burgers and fries it's really tough to beat.  Here's another thing I love about it (which I've never seen anywhere else):  when there's a long line at the Drive Thru, they'll send a kid out with an electronic ordering gizmo, who walks out to your car and gets you going on your order.  Genius!  That way your order gets a head start and you (and everyone behind you) aren't waiting for days at the window."}
{"text":"After hearing all the In-n-Out buzz, I finally got to try one.    I had the double double.  It was a pretty good fast food burger.  What-a-burger is better though.  The location was VERY busy, but service was quick, and prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"So I ordered a veggie cheese burger with EVERYTHING. And she asks if I wanted onions.. I said yes EVERYTHING. I want EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING except for the meat. I get it home with no cheese, no pickles, just dry hard bread and wilted lettuce. One tomato. Not worth it at all!!!  The thing is, I could have ordered from the drive thru..  The girl standing in the drive thru insisted that I ordered from her even tho no one else was in line. I could of had a different result if I ordered directly like normal."}
{"text":"This location is EXTREMELY busy but your food is made in a timely manner AND is of great quality. I've only been to a few IN-N-OUTs but this one really sets the bar. Clean, staff is friendly and food is great!"}
{"text":"The parking lot kinda sucks around here, but all's fair in love and war with In N Out. Love the food, hate the traffic.. Totally worth it. Not to mention an older couple was introduced by animal style fries when I sat down with my order. Pretty sure I changed their life and they will never look at a fry the same again. I've never been a huge fan of In N Out fries (here comes the backlash), but who can go wrong with melted American cheese, that special sauce, and grilled onions? That combination makes anything amazing."}
{"text":"Double double animal style is great, miss it when are in the northwest.  Being provincial we don't like the Maine potatoes."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love In-N-Out Burger it was love at first bite many years ago when I first discovered these guys. This location was a little disappointing but they still managed to put out a great product. The drive thru seemed to move at a steady pace but the inside was extremely slow compared to other locations I've frequented that were much busier. The inside of the restaurant was about 30% full so the wait time was ridiculous in my opinion I understand they make the burgers to order but 15 minutes for a double double was frustrating. The floors were in the process of being mopped by several employees and were slick and greasy the tables needed to be wiped down and the trash needed to be emptied after all it wasn't like they were trying to recover from the lunch crowd it was about 3:00 PM on a weekday.    No manager in sight so no one was directing the employees or managing the operation. My next trip I will stop at the one off the strip at the bottom of the I-15 ramp off of Tropicana Drive ( I think that's the correct location of the great In-N-Out Burger). I just hope this is not the trend of the In-N-Out Burger chain."}
{"text":"I've never tried their food until today, and I would hate to rate it a 1/10. I'm really picky about my burgers and theirs weren't good at all. The fries were way too greasy. They almost tasted fake. The lemonade and ice cream was pretty good, but their food was terrible. They also have no other options of a burger. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"If you want a Cheap and Good Eat, come to In n out.  Just because you are in Vegas, doesn't mean you are expected to pay $15-$30 for each meal.  $5 here will leave you satisfied and full.    Simple and easy menu.  Double Double with onions and fries.  THE BEST!  I feel bad for states that don't have In N Out.  You guys are missing out."}
{"text":"Satisfying and fast, a decent burger and fries. In-N-Out knows what they are doing and they do it well. You get you money's worth."}
{"text":"In-n Out Burger is my favorite place to eat. This is the location I usually visit. The food is delicious and service is great. The food is ready in about 5-10 minutes which is great considering how busy they usually are. The only down side is that the tables are usually dirty and I have to wipe them down.      The employees are kind and always smile at my little brother when he asks for some stickers at the counter. Another thing I like about this place is their secret menu. The animal fries are amazing! You can also eat outside when the weather is nice.       In conclusion, I would recommend this place to everyone who hasn't tried it. This is the reason they are always so busy."}
{"text":"Always big crowds in the evenings especially the weekends. Awesome burgers  and animal  fries . For 2 double doubles, the animal fries  and large soda  set me back $15 but yeah it was delicious and yes l was starving."}
{"text":"I SHOULDA GOT A DOUBLE-DOUBLE  Stopped by here last night and picked up dinner after work. I got a #2, which is a cheeseburger, fries and a drink. I ordered my fries well done and a strawberry shake to drink."}
{"text":"Service: Outstanding. They were friendly and courteous from the moment we order to the end when an employee ask if we needed anything.   Food: Superb for a cheap price. You have to order the Animal Fries. It's so good.  I would recommend going to this In-n-Out burger. Awesome staff."}
{"text":"This place is consistently good. Today the outside order taker was dancing as we pulled up. Nice to see someone who enjoys his job. It's a fast food joint, so not much to say except it's great!  The service is always friendly and the food is always tasty."}
{"text":"My first and only in and out bc this is not available on east coast... When I can here around 1pm, the line inside was sooo long we got back in the car and decided to go drive thru.... Which had like 20 cars waiting!!! So went to jack in he box instead :(  The lines were less longer when We came for drive thru after midnight. All the four square reviews spoke of animal style. Had the double meat burger animal style and the animal style fries. Very delicious... So big I didn't know which way to put it in my mouth (twss). Had to flip it upside down to start eating the bottom bun cuz I kept eating the top part. ;)"}
{"text":"We love In and Out a lot. Great for the family. Good food at a reasonable price. Always clean inside.  Sometimes they are so busy their isn't a place to sit down, but that is just a testament to how much everyone else loves this place as well.  TIP: Next time you order a burger or fries try them \"Animal Style\""}
{"text":"Who doesn't love In-N-Out? Beware, there can be a little bit of a wait when it's a busy night but it is still worth it in the end if you're hungry. Try a Grilled Cheese with Grilled Onions, it will make your stomach happy."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Double double with everything and animal fries! You just can't go wrong with the freshness and flavor of these burgers! I'm so HAPPY that we are getting one in my home town!"}
{"text":"Simple, but homemade.  Good people watching.  Prices cheap.  I took my family on Spring Break, 2013.  It was their first trip and they were impressed.  I see why people rave!"}
{"text":"The bomb dot com!!!! Loveeee the burgers. Only reason I give 4 stars is because I'm not a fan of animal style fries, or their fries at all really. But everything else about this place is the bessssst. If we had in-n-out in NC I would be fat and eat it every day."}
{"text":"Crap. I accidentally wrote the previous review for the wrong in-n-out. This one in Vegas is likely the best in the country. It's fast, clean, efficient and of course there are really friendly employees, as it's in-n-out.   I've been here dozens of times and always get everything perfect."}
{"text":"The sign above the kitchen says it all... I love In-N-Out! This is our newest location in Phoenix and it's in a great area. Whole Foods and Trader Joe's across the street. The employees here are always so friendly and outgoing and the food is so tasty and fresh. If you are gonna do fast food this is the way to go for sure."}
{"text":"Nice staff but that doesn't matter when your cooks undercook your red meat. I understand some people enjoy rare red meat...but when you specify WELL DONE, for medical and personal reasons, they should be making sure that is what you receive. Went back TWICE to fix food, and the second time came out even worse. Literal raw meat in the inside of a charred patty. Turn your grills down instead of rushing to cater to impatient customers!! LA would've never done me like this :-/"}
{"text":"Please...no matter whatever the location, the service is always friendly.  Burgers and shakes are very solid.  The burger is a little better when it is done animal style.  I usually alternate between strawberry and chocolate flavors for my shakes."}
{"text":"Since I traveled from BWI airport in Maryland it was only fitting to eat at In-N-Out on S Maryland Pkwy.  During a recent weekend trip to Vegas our party ate here twice!  Visit# 1 - Demolished a double double (animal style)  Visit# 2 - Ate a double double grilled (protein style)  Not sure if it was the wings I ate an hour prior to visit #2 or the actual lettuce (vice buns) but I could not finish my animal style fries during visit #2 and barely finished my protein style double double.     Thank you In-N-Out!"}
{"text":"This is the most massive in n out I have ever been to. Granted and as expected it took forever to got food. There also wasn't enough seating inside either.   Brilliant location. Delicious In n Out worthy food. They just have some logistics to work out on how to serve the influx of customers."}
{"text":"Best in-n-out EVER. The girls at the drive through were so ridiculously sweet today. I was like...come through, burgers!"}
{"text":"in & out. great price, cheap burger, fast service, made to order, animal style, etc. Close to the strip and its really good!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and a clean place! Wasn't too impressed w/fries, they tasted bland. The burger was good but I wasn't blown away by it. This place receives a lot of attention but I walked away a little disappointed."}
{"text":"Always hit up this in n out when I visit Vegas and today Joshua was a very great cashier"}
{"text":"I always get their protein style animal style and its very good. Doesn't seem like a lot of food but its tasty. Service is usually good but not always, but they are always super busy."}
{"text":"It's rare like never that I visit Vegas or the West Coast without eating at least one meal at In-N-Out Burger if it's in-between meals I justify it by calling it a snack either way I'm enjoying a double double. This location is like going to the concession stand at the circus on any given day but no matter the crowds or how long the wait I'm not walking past it. It's rare that I see a security guard at the entrance to a burger joint but there's one here and it appears he's sampling what he's paid to protect or at least paid to open the door for the crowds.  I don't know if this is the best fast food burger on planet earth but it rivals any I've eaten at and I think I've tried most of the most popular ones at least once. There's no doubt this is a popular walk up location and although the wait can be long the food will be served hot and fresh. The dine in area is relatively small but there are a few tables outdoors and also a concrete wall out front that some choose to take advantage of, if this is an option you chose be prepared to share with the pigeons they are very friendly and bold so protect your burger and share your fries..."}
{"text":"I love this location it's nice and close to the freeway which is convenient. I'd also like to say that Victoria is a very efficient employee who takes care of orders with a big smile. 10/10 recommend"}
{"text":"Wow, I cannot see what all the hype is about. They totally screwed up my order. Apparently you need to learn another language to f-n order here.  When I asked for \"meat, cheese & bread\" I've been informed that I should have asked for \"Dry\".  WTH is up with that?    Totally NOT impressed!  Won't be back! Too pissed off...."}
{"text":"Fast service, cheap pricing, and good food. me and my boyfriend always get out fries with a side of their in n out sauce packets! Yum! p:  This place is also a Pokestop! :)"}
{"text":"Really good, but a fried burger just doesn't cut it for me. Grill it over an open flame (ala Carl's/Hardee's) and it would be perfection in a bun, IMHO. Being from Seattle, I find them similar to Puget Sounds own Dick's Burgers (never been to a 5 Guys), but owning an RV and cooking so much of our meats over lump charcoal has spoiled me.  Now the fries are a 7! Firm, delicious and not grainy like some other places, these spuds alone are worth the trip."}
{"text":"Love thier protien burger with grilled onions, never a disappointment and this location always gets you order right. And the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"A feeling of sadness just came over me as I write this review for In and Out burger. It's just so sad that we do not have one on the east coast and I don't think we ever will according to my research. In and Out burger is one of the best things that the west coast offers that the best coast does not have. Maybe it's soooo good because you can actually taste the freshness and quality of the burger. Or maybe because it's not so accessible here that I find myself daydreaming of biting into a juicy burger dripping with the animal sauce. Anyway, I know you get the point. I ate here twice within my 3 day visit in Las Vegas. The line was crazyyyyyy long both times I went. Both inside and drive thru. Now you just know it's that good. The line moved rather quickly though. I really like that the menu is super simple making it easy for an indecisive person. Again, the burger is so good. I ate the fries with extra animal sauce and did I mention even their milk shakes are amazing. I can't wait to pay the west coast a visit and believe me my first stop will be at an In and Out burger."}
{"text":"No other burger joint compares to the awesomeness of In-N-Out Burger's style.  A Cheeseburger runs at $2.25, which is what makes it such an easy decision to order two.  Fries are great! Milkshakes are awesome!  Always busy regardless of the location, but the staff always manage to get orders out quickly.  I rave about this business to everyone I meet whenever I am out traveling other states that do not have the privilege of an In-N-Out Burger within their state lines.  PS: Don't forget to learn the secret menu!"}
{"text":"Being from the midwest I always crave In-N-Out when I know I am traveling to a place where I know they exist.  This location provided the fix.  They had a fantastically clean restaurant, very friendly staff,  and the classically great food that I count on from In-N-Out.    As always, a MAJOR recommend. Especially for people who don't live in areas served by In-N-Out."}
{"text":"In n out is my favorite place to get a burger. It is cheap, it is basic, it is good! The hamburger and bun have a crispiness around the border which makes it feel like there is a party in my mouth and everyone's invited. The coke for some reason even tastes better than usual. The fries are just average and I think McDonalds has the upper hand here. But their hamburgers are awesome!   So what about this location? The crappy thing about In-N-Out is the drive through can get RIDICULOUSLY long, but they are relatively fast. But at this location it is particularly difficult because there is a break in the line to allow cars to pass. This break causes 2 things: first is you don't know where the line begins, and second it causes some cars to crowd in front of you. Also, being in a parking lot you often block in other cars. But they do a decent job of having someone outside to take the order.  The other bad news is if you decide to order from the inside it takes forever! A long line in the drive through is faster than being the only person on the inside. I'm not sure why that is. Either way you must try In-N-out!"}
{"text":"Usually In-N-Out Burger is one of the first places I visit when I come to LA, and so I'm pleasantly surprised that there is location here in Phoenix.  As a Houstonian, we are unfortunately deprived of such a place.    Definitely a must visit for any burger enthusiast, and their fries are out of this world."}
{"text":"It's In & Out & unless you don't know you always have to wait in line doesn't matter what time of day. However your burger will be hot, good & consistent. The place clean even on a busy weekend. So stop, wait, eat & return."}
{"text":"I was beyond excited to finally try In-n-out after being to California twice and not trying it there. As a Canadian the hype is pretty real for this place. Because it's cheap, good quality and of course the not so secret menu items. I tried the 2x2 animal style burger and animal style fries. Everything was good, don't get me wrong but I was way to hyped for this place. The food was good, and animal style adds good flavour but everything seemed cold and really greasy. I'm definitely going to try it again if I have the opportunity. But if you're visiting and don't have these around your home try it. It's cheap, decent burgers and filling. Ps the lemonade they had was amazing."}
{"text":"My favorite fast food place . Everything tastes fresh from lettuce to tomatoes to burger . I just love it . Animal fries is something to try if it was your first time trying it."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to eat fast food they have the best burgers in town when have you seen an empty in n out! Never! Omg I am soo happy they made this new location because I hated the long drive to Dysart location I will for sure  be going to eat here very often and let's not forget great quality food for great prices!"}
{"text":"BEST burgers I've ever had in my life, hands down! Everything is so fresh!   PROS:  -Fresh ingredients -Crispy, non-oily fries  CONS: -NONE!"}
{"text":"We discovered Animal Style Burgers and Fries on this trip.  Very tasty extra off the \"secret menu\".  This is grilled onions, cheese, and fry sauce.  This is a diet killer but a  nice thing to try once in a while.    We just went to this location one time this trip to Las Vegas as we didn't want to completely blimp out.  Love trying the different stuff here.  We'll be back next trip.  This location is very convenient to the south end of the strip."}
{"text":"I love this place. One of my favorite burger joints. I have been to In N Outs before but recently friends have exposed my to the \"secret\" menu. Double Doubles are great but they are awesome when you get them animal style. 3X3 animal style forget about it. I have died and gone to cheeseburger heaven. Also love the fact that this one is close to work and home.  Such a simple menu, burgers, fries, shakes and drinks but it is when you get into the customization that you find the magic of In N Out. Animal style burgers, grilled cheese sandwiches, animal style fries, etc. The combinations expand so much just by adding a few simple things to an already simple menu.  The staff is awesome too. No one ever seems to have a bad day and be grumpy. They are always in a great mood. It borders on creepy because everyone who works there is so nice and looks like they are from the 50s. It borders on the Stepford Wives almost. Maybe we are just so used to less than perfect service that when we get great service we don't know how to handle it.  Can't go wrong with a 3X3 animal style, fries and a chocolate shake. Love it. Best place ever."}
{"text":"I think a true judge of a business is when things go bad. I have been coming to this in n out for about four years. They finally messed my order up and when i came back 4 hours later they replaced the missing food without question and apologized."}
{"text":"In N Out Burger has never won me over as far as their burgers and fries go. But for prices? Pretty good deal for a small burger and tasteless fries that never fill me up (and I'm tiny!). I agree with several other so-so-ers that it's an overrated burger joint, and you really may as well go to McDonalds. At this location, I have an issue with the lot structure as I can NEVER get into the actual parking lot for this place without attempting a traffic jam (it's a congested area, and it requires going down a certain road to pull into it, while the other 3 sides of the lot are sealed off, what gives?)."}
{"text":"I'll never understand why In-N-Out is considered the gold standard of burger joints.   The burgers are average, the fries are mediocre at best.  I'll take Burger King instead.   I patronize the place only when all the other fast food stores are closed.  The best thing about In-N-Out is that it's open until 2am."}
{"text":"THE BEST FAST FOOD CHAIN THERE IS!  I do not know why IN-N-OUT has not headed out to the East Coast yet... what are you waiting for?  These burgers and fries are to die for.  It was on my to-do list as I headed to Arizona.  This was one of the places I HAD TO GO and make sure I go every time.  Do not miss out!"}
{"text":"Great burgers on toasted buns that were delicious.  Very friendly, efficient and welcoming staff.  Check it out.  I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good fast food basic menu but Google for the not so secret menu for more options. The double burgers bare excellent and for 2.70 you can't beat it."}
{"text":"Tasty, inexpensive burgers served up at an establishment that treats their employees and customers well. What more could anyone ask for? Hint: They have a secret menu on-line. Check it out."}
{"text":"Had and awesome burger and fires that were both animal style def have to go here again before I leave to go back to PA. Everyone talks about in and out burger and I see exactly why they were talking about it. Menu is so simple and the burger is are so awesome!!"}
{"text":"Always fast and delicious. Love how cheap it is. In n out is a go to whenever we're feeling lazy/don't want to cook. Not a huge fan of the grilled onions on the animal style fries. Had to throw them out because the entire thing just tasted like burned onions. Other than that, perfect!"}
{"text":"Whenever I get the In-N-Out Urge, I head straight to this location...that's because it's the closest location to where I live!  I like that their open till 2am so when I get the late night craving for a burger and a shake, it hits the spot! If your worried about the carbs, order your burger animal style and there won't be any buns, it will be wrapped in lettuce.  If you don't mind the carbs, then order your fries animal style...it will come with grilled onions, cheese, and their special sauce on top. Their shakes are bomb also..I always mix mine with 1/2 chocolate & 1/2 strawberry...i'm craving one right now so I'm gonna go grab one! Hope to see you there! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Sooo good.  Ordered one double-double animal style and a regular double-double.   Perfect. Just get it."}
{"text":"Nice location, great staff and environment... but I wasn't a fan of the food. Sorry, I'm a Texan that prefers her Whataburger lol"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place forever because I've heard how great it is. I was not disappointed at all, their burgers are delish!!!!"}
{"text":"Living in the midwest we did not have a in-n-out burger so when I came to vegas for a visit before I moved here I knew I had to try this place just off all the people who said I have not lived until I tried one of their burgers and don't forget the animal fries! So we tried them and MAN was my life incomplete without this wonderful place!! The burgers are great they taste fresh and moist! The animal fries i have no idea how i ate fries without the toppings ontop. This place is supper affordable and they have such great attitudes! Ive been here for 2.5 years and eat there atlest once a month. It does not matter the location the food is amazing and customer service as well, there is nothing better than a uniformed company that no matter the location the food quality and service is the same  and that is a rare find!"}
{"text":"The staff is great.  Complaints about being too friendly are just dumb.  Want to compare this staff with just about any other burger joint in the Valley?  Food's good, fresh and cheap. Don't find the burgers swell enough?  Houston's has great ones, and only sixteen bucks.  Only downside is the location.  Very crowded entrance/exit from the shopping center and tight parking."}
{"text":"Greasy, fast food burger and there's not even bacon on the menu.  Will never understand why anyone with taste buds would eat here by choice."}
{"text":"So I had a few hours to spend in Las Vegas and I was starving (along with my fiancées daughter). She suggested this place since it's only a west coast thing lol. I don't eat meat so I ordered the grilled cheese which is a burger fixings w/out the meat!! The food was fresh and the service was that of Chick-fil-a which I appreciated. No one seemed to hate their job lol. The grilled cheese was ok. I think I enjoyed it more so because I was so hungry. The fries though :( they are straight trash!!! They don't taste or look real. They're almost like eating cardboard. That's why they get 3/5 stars. Otherwise, i can't speak on the burger itself lol sorry meat eaters!!"}
{"text":"Obsessed. Cheap and fresh for fast food. Order animal style and you won't be dissapointed"}
{"text":"Literally gobbled this meal up. I love in-n-out burger and fries animal style. This location is pretty close to the strip, so it's not too expensive to get here if you take an uber or lyft.  Literally the best thing you can eat after drinking all day on the strip. It's smothered in sauce and just so delicious."}
{"text":"Damn this bitch was packed but that didn't stop us from going 4x during our Vegas trip. We just learned not to order inside. I forgot how good their animal style fries and neapolitan shakes are. MMMMMmMMmNMmmdsdnfh"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan, but works in a pinch. Grilled onions ALWAYS! I think I prefer Culvers butter burgers over IN N Out."}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out! I love their burgers. I'm obsessed with their Strawberry shakes! And their fries are NEVER soggy."}
{"text":"This is the first time my hubby and I tried out this location. The last time we were in town this didn't exist. We ordered fries animal style, regular fries, cheeseburger and a Choco/ vanilla shake. I must say the quality wasn't as good as the one off strip. The place was extremely busy (labor day weekend) long wait for food.  The fries were good with all the fixings, but the plain fries were kind of cardboard like. The burgers also lacked the flavor that we remember. After we finished this meal, we already decided that we will head to dean Martin location before flying back to east coast."}
{"text":"I must say this location is definitely better than the one on the strip. I tried this one for the first time few years ago when visiting Vegas and was not disappointed. And now three years later, after trying the one on the strip on tuesday, my hubby and I both agreed to visit this one on our last day in Vegas before catching our flight back to EAST COAST, and let me tell you, we r glad that we did. We had cheeseburger animal style and a mixed vanilla and chocolate shake, sooooo yummy. So fortunate to have this meal before flying back home. Remember to ask for extra spread!!!!"}
{"text":"Since Ohio doesn't have In-N-Out, I made a pact with myself that come hell or high water, I would eat an In-N-Out burger during my trip to Vegas.  Two hours, a monorail trip and a $25 cab ride later, I simultaneously accomplished my goal and realized that if I put as much effort into realizing my dreams as I put into eating delicious hamburgers, I'd probably be a lot farther along in life.  While In-N-Out isn't my all-time favorite fast food burger (Three cheers for Five Guys Burgers and Fries!) it's still one of the best I've ever had.  Yes, I had it Animal Style.  And yes, it was delicious.  Call me a freak if you will but I would've enjoyed a little more mustard mixed into the meat.  The best parts of my In-N-Out experience were my fries and shake.  At first, I was too busy digging into my cheeseburger to notice just how light and crispy my fries were.  Even more impressive was the fact that... Brace yourself... In-N-Out's fries actually taste like potatoes!  But as good as the fries were, they barely held a candle to what might have been the best fast food milkshake I've ever had.  Before my trip to In-N-Out, I was under the impression that White Castle had the best chocolate shake around.  It's always nice to be proven wrong, especially when being proven wrong means you can give White Castle a little less credit.  For years, I've heard In-N-Out described as the Mecca of fast food.  My verdict?  While In-N-Out might not be my favorite burger joint, I enjoyed every moment of my holy pilgrimage and would gladly make it again."}
{"text":"Nuttin better than a Double - Double No Onions ! mmmmmmmmmmmmm This location is the Quickest of all the ones in Vegas. During Peak Hours, they have an associate taking orders ( Drive Thru ). By the time you reach the Cashier, you are only a minute or 2 from picking up that Mouth Watering Burger. The 1 on Trop & 15 is just too damn Busy ! Morning, Noon and Nite. Yes the Burgers have Shrunk over the Years. I remember when a Whopper was Huge. Boy have they gone Downhill ; Carls, McDs & Wendys also.  Only In-N- Out and Fatburger  ( Del Taco sometimes ) have Fast Food Burgers worth paying for. I'm starting to get Hungry. Maybe i'll pick 1 up @ Halftime."}
{"text":"Soooooo good. Animal style everything. Whole grilled onion. We need this on the east coast"}
{"text":"Succinct ordering in the drive-thru is the greatest challenge of In-N-Out. Each time I think I've got it down, the ordering cashier reads back my order in 70% of the words I delivered.  Cheeseburger, grilled onions, chopped chilis, protein-style. Fries. Neapolitan.  How can it possibly be delivered more concisely. It cannot. And yet, it will be. Thank God grandma In-N-Out looked favorably on Arizona."}
{"text":"Not the greatest burger I have ever had but I dug their style and it was damn good after a fun hike up Camelback. Definitely try it out if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Learn the secret lingo and enjoy.  This place is hands down the best fast food joint there is.  In fact I hate even referencing it as a fast food place, the burgers are that damn good.  This one in particular had amazing service too - although I am partial because my Animal Style Double Double came out 10 minutes before my friends who ordered before me."}
{"text":"Obviously not a review of In N Out because I am a die hard fan. Location staff was especially friendly and thought that was awesome. Tell corporate to slow down on the mass locations! Don't want to dilute the best burger ever!"}
{"text":"Haven't had In-N-Out too much since I'm from the east coast but it lives up to the hype.  The line here was almost out the door but we got to the front in under 20 minutes.  I've had In-N-Out only a few times before and this was probably the worst one but it's still worth 4 stars.  This just shows you how good this place is.  Get everything animal style, it's worth it."}
{"text":"I came here expecting the best burger ever.. hailing from Chicago, that would be a tall task, being that we have so many great burger joints.    Maybe it was too much hype.. maybe I expected a high end burger..  I came away with a very good impression nonetheless. The burger was very good, fresh, great bun to meat ratio, good toppings and great value. The fries were alright,  kinda soggy and a bit underwhelming, even with animal style toppings.   4 stars.. great fast food burger,  one of the best chain burgers I have had. I realized quickly this was not a high end joint but the quality was definitely comparable. Service was fast for the amount of traffic in and out this place."}
{"text":"I am probably out of the norm based on other reviews but I really don't get the hype here.  The place was packed at 11:30am...the line was literally out the door and a 20 minute wait.    I had the double double and fries (not animal style).  What I got was a double double animal style and soggy fries.  The burger is way oversauced and super messy.  The taste pretty good but I don't think it is anything ridiculous that I haven't had at other decent burger chains.  The fries should definitely be ordered well done as another yelper suggested.  Mine were soggy and lack luster.    I'm not one for crowds or lines for burgers and fries...but that is just me."}
{"text":"Worth however long the wait in the drive-thru is.  Make mine a double-double, mustard grilled and hell yeah I want onions and pickles on that."}
{"text":"This was not a rewarding experience.  I walked over from the Atomic Museum through the campus of UNLV.    I had seen some hamburger glory at the end of my road.  I waited in line.  They were expedited the orders through the drive thru.    I waited more.  I finally got my cheese burger.  It was not worth my wait or my walk.  Not super bad, but not worth going out of the way for."}
{"text":"Great Burgers.. Only rivaled by Shake Shack in NYC.  I love this food... its the ultimate treat."}
{"text":"Good burgers and french fries as always!  Don't forget the In-N-Out sauce for your french fries.  We ordered one meal set for cheese burger, another cheese burger and a milkshake.  All that for only $10 :0 Seating could be tough but good service."}
{"text":"Great service that was fast and very polite at all times for a location that was always packed with customers. The burgers are first class but the fries could be better. I'd definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I visited this in and out location about a week ago in the late eveningwith my girlfriend and was absolutely blown away by the generosity of the staff!  We rolled up to the window realizing we forgot our debit card at home. The staff member turned and told us to wait. He comes back in notifies us that we cannot get the drinks however they could give the food to us free of charge. I was absolutely stunned and could not believe what I was hearing.  We were given the food as long as we will promise to try to return within the week and pay our bill.  I returned not only paying the bill but wanting to tip out both the manager and staff member that we're so grateful for giving us the food for the night. In and out has always been the best, but this goes over the top and beyond what great service is all about!   Oh you guys are absolutely amazing, we will be back even more and from here on out always with cash in hand lol you're forever loyal customer!"}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype is all about this burger place. The fries tasted stale, the burger meat was so thin. The burger itself had just bunch of lettuce and no meat. I would have to say the sauce was tasty. Tasted like their homemade mayo or something. The service was quick, which it should be for a fast food restaurant. There are limited seats and they are not sanitary. It would be a great drunk food burger but shake shack is much better from NY area."}
{"text":"I was very excited to finally try In-N-Out burger after hearing about it for so long. We drove here from the strip, about 10 mins away. There wasn't any line when we got in which was nice. Ordered the double-double and side of animal fries.   The burger was good. Soft buns with a good portion of meat. I got onion on mine which was a little thick and overpowering. The animal fries were stale with slices of cheese on top with grilled onions and thousand island sauce. I didn't feel like they were anything special. But i guess for the price you do get a lot."}
{"text":"Great as always.  We were in Scottsdale for a long weekend and this was our best meal!    In-n-out loses one star for me because their fries are not crispy, even if we order them well done.  Other than that, fantastic."}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out..It's my favorite fast food burger!  This particular location is just as clean and pleasant as any other I have eaten in be it California or Vegas.  My only complaint is the horrible parking lot that they built this in.  I wish I could give some sort of helpful hint other than....on a busy night BE PATIENT!"}
{"text":"I visited my first In-N-Out when I was sixteen.  In the many years since that first glorious bite I have never, NEVER had a negative experience.  Be it sitting in the lobby after 10 people placed there order or being at one of the more popular locations and having 20 cars ahead of me I always received exceptional service and a great burger.  This particular establishment seems to have been built for the onslaught of Double Double eaters.  The drive thru is long and actually some what aesthetically pleasing to the eye.  LIke every other In-N-Out I have been to, you can see the employees inside hustling to manufacture on the greatest burgers ever!  My negative review is a result of making a rather non-complex order and having only two vehicles ahead of me.  It was on a Saturday around 12:00 in the PM. I just want to note that the inside of place was not slammed by any stretch.  I sat there for over 10 minutes watching all the employees not move with any sense of urgency.  I thought maybe these two people ahead of me had made outlandish orders but this was not the case as I saw only one bag make it's way out the drive-thru window.  When I pulled up to the window, I did not receive any of the normal In-N-Out pleasantries.  The employee looked at me briefly and then went about making the brink holders.  I sat there like an idiot with my money in my hand for about 30 seconds and then I bailed."}
{"text":"We don't have In-N-Out in Oregon so every time I'm in CA I go. I was thrilled to find they had one near our hotel and would've eaten it for every meal if I could but self-control kicked in. This place was speedy considering the lunch rush, the staff friendly and the food AMAZING! I can't believe how inexpensive it is and appreciate the quality coming out of a fast food joint which I normally avoid. Still drooling thinking of my burger..."}
{"text":"Really good burgers, the fries aren't that good though. If you're in the strip this is going to be one of your cheapest food places to go to. This place will almost always be packed though, so be prepared for that. Only reason I gave it a four star is because I think since it is packed, the workers might be in a hurry and try and rush the food they cooked. We went there twice and the burger was pretty pink on the inside. But overall this is a really good spot. People in the west coast love these burgers and I see why."}
{"text":"Was so great full to find an in and out in Arizona! Was just as delicious as California. No surprise this place was super busy but we scored a seat as we walked in. To my surprise this is the only I mean ONLY in and out that I've ever ever been to that does not have the symbolic palm trees outside. It was extremely strange but all and all the good was great the service was very friendly"}
{"text":"I am a frequent flier here and for good reason. Everyone knows about the secret menu, so experiment! I like my fries done LIGHT WELL. Between Five Guys and In-N-Out, you can't go wrong. This place wins though! #winning"}
{"text":"Conventional In-N-Out joint. Drive thru guy (the driveway greeter) was too flamboyant for my likes."}
{"text":"Upon landing in Phoenix the first thing our children said was \"let's find an in and out burger!\"  New York doesn't have in and out burgers and they hoped by being \" out west\" they could have the treat they remembered from other trips, and they were not disappointed.  Delicious hamburgers, shakes and fries. Fast service even with a line. And a Target nearby for us to gather necessities for our trip. A great way to begin our National Parks adventure."}
{"text":"I just ate here a few minutes ago as I thought it would be good to eat here since the last time I ate at in n out and I was 15 or 16 around that time my has time flown by lol. Anyhow the food here is just as delicious as I remember it tried the animal style fries they were just as good as everybody says they are overall I would come back again if you try coming here get here before the rush hour which is 12 pm as you are going to be waiting awhile and you'll be stuck in a long line as I did to wait for your food."}
{"text":"I grew up in San Diego, and we didn't have these; they were a Los Angeles aberration.  I first had them about 10 years ago in Mountain View, CA and wasn't that impressed.  Now, the more I eat there, the more I like it.  I'd still prefer Sonic or Fatburger, but this will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"Always quick, but lacking in cleanliness. Restrooms are not well tended and that is off putting. Staff seemed overwhelmed, not just working quickly which causes an awkward environment as people shuffle around waiting or making their orders. Drink area is usually littered with straw wrappers and soaking wet. This is an easy fix and can definitely be done in about 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Life is not complete without In&Out burger. I wish there was some around my area, so when ever I travel it's a must stop. When we pulled up to this one in particular I saw a full parking lot and a very long line for the drive-thru, I braced myself for a 30 min wait, I was shocked when an employee ran up to the window to take our order and within 5 min we were at the window receiving our delicious food, this is my new Vegas location!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great choice for a quick bite to eat! Friendly staff, and accurate service. When we visited it was very busy, but our orders came out rather quickly and accurate. I will be visiting here again when I return to the West."}
{"text":"The drive thru took 30 minutes and when I finally got food was not hot. They offered to  redo my order but didn't want to wait anymore."}
{"text":"Place was awesome! My girlfriend and I vacationed at the Marriott down the street and I ate here three nights in a row lol Great customer service! Had a kid named Manny help pick out some shirts for my family members back home who was patient and very helpful with sizes. Would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"I just moved here about a month ago and everyone said \"You have to get an In-N-Out burger\".  I was really digging \"Whataburger\" but I decided to try this place out.  I should have just stayed away.  I had to wait in the drive through for about 15 minutes and my double burger was tiny, cold and raw in the middle.  Not pink or slightly under cooked but raw with an odd char on the outside.  The fries were half burnt and reminded me of \"Potato Sticks\" from when I was a kid, but not nearly as good.  I let my dog have some of it because it was so gross and it made him sick for 2 days.  I'll just stick with \"Whataburger\" or even McDonald's. I have no idea why this place would ever get a 5 Star review."}
{"text":"Sweet Animal style fries, Oh how good they are when HOT and the Cheeseburgers are always great too!!! Oh so good!!!  ***The service is always GREAT!!!  Such nice people work here!! :)"}
{"text":"why 5 stars for a chain fast food place? because they do it well here! they are trained! I guess because they are used to the normal vegas traffic they are REALLY efficient, line is long as hell but moves fast as hell as well! food comes out very quick and accurate! what else could you ask for?!   great place to get some food before you hit the road to head home, lots of parking as well  sidenote: they even have a store on the side for in and out merchandise if you're into that kind of stuff"}
{"text":"Don't let the line scare you away. It's worth the wait no matter how long it is. When we went there, the line was out the door but it goes by pretty fast. The menu is very simple, so it makes ordering food a piece of cake. I've been to alot of burger joints in the east coast but always wanted to try this. Got my chance when I went to vegas during the summer. This was the cheapest meal we got in vegas but I would say it was the best. In my opinion, this is my favorite burger place (yes, better than shake shack). Burger was juicy and flavorful, just the way I like it. Now, whenever I travel to the west coast, I'll have to stop by any of their locations."}
{"text":"On our trip to Las Vegas, I wanted to treat my girlfriend to an In N Out Burger since she had never had one! We walked in and, as is typical for any fast food joint near the strip, the line was insane. Not gonna lie, I was tempted to walk out but there were so many hard working staff and numbers were being called so quickly, I soon realized that the wait would be worth it. We ended up waiting only about 10 mins and we got our food. We ended up eating outside by the stage because there was not really any space inside to eat. I only gave it 4 stars because it was a bit too much to go through but all things considered it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I specially asked 4 times for my burger to be well done. Meaning no pink. For some reason they can never get it right so I made sure to tell every employee I came in contact with that I would like it well. They all guaranteed it would be. Once again it was not. I understand if it can not be made well done for whatever reason. That's fine just disclose it so I know to expect that. Don't guarantee it will be well done and not follow through #endofrant"}
{"text":"Ahhh, animal style fries. How I've missed you so.  This wasn't the best In-N-Out Burger I've been to, mainly because of the lack of cleaniness of the seating and flooring, but it was still pretty damn good. Keep in mind the secret menu to make your order unique and the envy of the person behind you.  I arrived at 11 PM, which was perfect since there wasn't a line in site. The next day, I arrived at lunch and was overwhelmed with mobs of hormone-induced teenagers waiting to devour every cow and potato in sight. So, make sure you arrive a little early or a little later for meal times. Regardless, it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"If it's after midnight, you've been at the tables for many hours, all you've had to eat is free drinks with some nutritional value (my favorite is the White Russian with double Kahlua), and you are hungry...  What should you do?  Do what we did. Head to In-N-Out!   Of course, everyone else in Vegas had the same idea! The parking lot was nearly full and there was a considerable line. However, since I live on the east coast, the wait was worth it since we won't have our own In-N-Out any time soon.   Animal Style FTW."}
{"text":"What can I say...I love In N Out! I think they serve one of the Best burgers in fast food! On top of the great burgers they serve, their service is second to none. They almost always have a long line. But, when they do...I can guarantee you that they will have someone waiting outside to take your order, so that you don't have to wait any longer to place your order. Everyone is always courteous and greets you with a smile. Between, the great food and service...they keep me coming back! Keep up the great work, Inn N Out."}
{"text":"I have eaten a lot of burgers in my life and this one was middle of the road at best.  I waited 15 minutes to eat this?   I can tell it's fresh but it's really nothing special. Heard so much about it but don't see myself coming back unless I forget how disappointing it was this time"}
{"text":"I love in n out burger!!! I live in Colorado but every time I make a trip to a state that has In n Out its my first stop for sure!!! Simple menu and easy to order. The hidden menu is the best!!! Anyone who hasn't tried their burgers is missing out!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a weekday afternoon for a shake and was not impressed.  The soul of the heart of an In-N-Out which is  the taste of the wonderful goodness they provide is to hustle to get back out there to those waiting.    My buddy and I pulled in behind a three other vehicle in the drive-thru and waited....waited..waited.....waited.  A sign of a kick ass INOB is the white hats bopping up and down in sign on unity honoring efficiency.  This was not do be gazed upon while sitting in a vehicle where the air conditioning sucks.    When heading north on 15 or heading back into down, I would seek out another i-N-o location."}
{"text":"Simplicity is the key to enjoying this place.  Take a look at the menu.  There's only 5 things you can order.... hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries, soda and shakes.  That's it.  Nothing much to think about here.      Unlike other fast food joints, they have no chicken, no patty melts, no tacos, no nuggets, no chili, no kids meals, no breakfast, no onion rings, no egg sandwiches, no cookies, no bacon, no curly fries, no coffee, no orange juice, no sliders, no rib sandwiches, no pork products, no ice cream cones, no parfaits, no burritos, no salads, no dollar menu, no value menu and no cherry turnovers.  I think this burger is a winner.  I love a good cheeseburger, but when I go to In and Out I order my double burger with no cheese.  It tastes so good it doesn't need the cheese.  But I do recommend the grilled onions.  That is the way to go... grilled onions.  Does Burger King offer grilled onions?  I seriously doubt it.  Would you want to eat grilled onions from Burger King?  Think about your response carefully before answering.  The fries are sliced right there from a real potato.  A REAL POTATO.  Like the brown thing that you see at the grocery store.  When I see a McDonalds or Jack in the Box truck driving around town I imagine inside that truck is a lot of frozen food.  I gotta figure that the fries are frozen in a bag.  But at In and Out Burger, I can see the guy slicing up the REAL POTATOES."}
{"text":"I always have good services every time I go to In-n-out. However, this time was not so great and it was my first time at this location. Food was a little blander than usual, but it was packed so that might be because they were busy. Which wasn't a huge deal. My biggest complaint is that the drink I ordered tasted like cleaning supplies. Like they had just cleaned the machine and put the soda in immediately idk, but tasted pretty horrible. Disappointed in the quality at this location."}
{"text":"Normally I'm very pleased with In-N-Out Burger when I go there. But I went to this particular one around 2pm. I went through the drive up and there was a line but it moved fast. The workers were very kind and pleasant which is not my complaint. My burger on the other hand was burnt to a crisp, there was half a head of lettuce and so much onion on it that I could barely tell there was a burger on the bun at all. The bun was stale and dry and the bottom bun was broken in half which made the whole sandwich fall apart when I tried to eat it...I was so disappointed I just threw it all away. I would have gone back and demanded a different one but I had already made it home and wasn't going to drive all the way back for a $4.00 sandwich. I don't think I'll be going back to that particular location, the one on Eastern always gives me a great cheeseburger..."}
{"text":"WE love this place!!!  Beef patties that never been frozen, fresh cut fries, and unbeatable price. -- What's not to love?!  Quick and fulfilling lunch for sure if you are just in the mood to get full and satisfied real fast in Vegas.  High recommended."}
{"text":"Yes I did it 5 Stars for a burger joint and without a bit of guilt.  This place rocks my wife makes me drive from our home on Shea and 130th Street to this location thats like 10 miles one way just for a burger.  Sometimes its fricken late as hell but I always deliver so I can get mine to if ya know what I mean.  Monster Style heck any style here is simply fantastic.  I love how they let you see into the kitchen.  Nothing to hide here not like the other joints.  This place is the pinnacle of clean from the parking lot to the kitchen.  The burgers are fresh the fries fresh cut right before your eyes.  In and Out is the best at what they do make delicious burgers and sell them to you at a price that makes you smile.  Get one, two maybe three its all good.  They are rapidly expanding and for good reason.  Please read this review and build one across the street from me.  Im sure that the Mayo Clinic will give you the land for free and Im sure I'll have to visit the Mayo in a couple months to have my arteries cleared so I can eat more of your delicious burgers.  Simply Fantastic.  A must on anyones Bucket List."}
{"text":"First time eating at in n out. Cheese Burger was great and wish I would have had the double. Fries were so-so.   It was crowded for lunch but service was still fairly quick.   Would easily recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"In N Out deserves 5 stars!!!! It is by far the best burger in the world :) the fries are so good and fresh, the shakes are amazing. Price is low. Perfect!!  I bring a double double home to the east coast for my dad everytime I come out to Vegas. Yes they are that good :)"}
{"text":"Always our first stop when we come to Las Vegas, we get 2 double-double meal, the burgers are juicy and tasty, fries are crispy, never disappoints. Can't wait to come back on our next visit to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I really wish we had these in South Florida. They are excellent fast-food. We all know that you have to order their double-burger \"Animal Style\" YUMMMMY!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"So in n out is a fast food burger joint and I love burgers so had to try it the last time I was in Vegas. It was ok- in my opinion it's overhyped. However I did notice someone said the best way to have it is animal style so maybe I'd have loved it if I went with that option."}
{"text":"It's a California staple that is making it's way across the US in some fashion or another. The draw is the burgers made to order and the special sauce. The pricing is unbeatable and it's better than your average fast food burger hands down. My standard order: Fries animal style, double cheeseburger extra pickles and animal style and chocolate milkshake.  This location on the Linq Promanade is so convenient!"}
{"text":"It's nice to have an In N Out so close to the strip, if you're on the opposite side of the one that is actually located to the strip. It's a California staple that is making it's way across the US in some fashion or another. The draw is the burgers made to order and the special sauce. The pricing is unbeatable and it's better than your average fast food burger hands down. My standard order: Fries animal style, double cheeseburger and chocolate milkshake."}
{"text":"The best burgers in town better than high end resto's, they only serve one menu and its just burgers. They do it right :)"}
{"text":"Anytime I get to eat In-N-Out is a special treat for me. Especially when I am on vacation, because I never eat fast food. For some reason In-N-Out doesn't taste like normal fast food to me.   Everything is always fresh and delicious. This is a great location and everyone was super friendly, fast and efficient.   Great job for keeping the consistency!"}
{"text":"It was a fun experience I like how each cup has a bible verse on the bottom of it. The food and shakes were good as well."}
{"text":"Classic in n out.  No real complaints besides the parking and drive-in situation at this location.  It can be very hard to get into the drive through lane at this location.  In addition, getting out of the parking lot is not good, especially on the weekends or during lunch time."}
{"text":"never had in n out before, i am from Washington. the burgers are pretty tasty for a plain simple menu. Customer service was great! I just found out about the secret menu and will order them the next time i am back here!"}
{"text":"The young men working there are great. Fast, polite and take extra time to bring us napkins and creamer. This is one of the best locations and I've been going to In & Out since the 1990's. Never disappointed. This shows you that paying your employees a decent wage makes. Difference in the service you get. Go In & Out  Great job to the young people working hard."}
{"text":"It is IN and Out what can go wrong!  After spending 6+ years on the east coast I have truly come to realize how great this national treasure is.   The order: 2 double-doubles with ketchup and mustard instead of the spread and with onions and fries."}
{"text":"Just stopped there to grab some food to go  I recommend the cheeseburger protein style if you want to stay in shape and yet enjoy the taste of a good piece of fresh meat"}
{"text":"After tasting in-N-Out burger, I kindly understand why people are crazy about it. comparing to McDonald's, it has more veggies, such as onion, lettuces and tomato. For $2.55 a burger, no wonder it kills it but they get to improve their fries. McDonald's does better."}
{"text":"How can you not LOVE a burger place where everything is FRESH! No freezers and a burger only costs $2!!!!  This location is great. They have a drive-thru that goes very fast. Often they have a person waiting to take your order instead of yelling it into a speaker box.   For a combo meal you can get a cheeseburger, fries & diet coke for $5 and some change.   The restrooms are clean and the service is very fast. There's plenty of parking & after you eat lunch, walk over to Yogurtland or Starbucks for dessert."}
{"text":"It may seem weird to give a 5 star rating to a fast food place. But I feel like this in-n-out moves lines very efficiently without losing the quality of the service. Compared to a few other similar places, they're doing a great job."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their double double burger loaded with animal sauce. Will definitely be coming back in the future."}
{"text":"Def wasnt my favorite. I'm from Seattle so i was excited to try the Dicks Burgers of Cali. Didnt like Velveeta on my fries."}
{"text":"Oh In-N-Out. As an east coaster, I had always heard tales of the Mecca that is our west coast burger heaven known as In-N-Out. I would hear of the life-changing experience dining here would be, how the burgers are beyond belief, the fries so scrumptious and the experience ever so humbling that you would forever be a changed human being. Needless to say, I was slightly disappointed the first time I finally did make it out to In-N-Out. Are the burgers and fries good? Yes! The prices excellent? Yes! Is it a life-changing burger experience? Certainly not.  The best way to describe In-N-Out is an old-school McDonald's competitor that stuck much closer to its mid-1900's roots. The menu is plain and simple. Your choices include just a few kinds of burgers, fries, sodas and shakes. I always appreciate the stick-to-one-thing-and-get-it-right mentality. In-N-Our serves up a fast food burger well. But it really is just that: a fast food burger. Although the prices are hard to beat and the taste just fine, I would rather spend a bit more and head to Five Guys or another fast casual or gourmet burger place.  What more is there to say really? The In-N-Out chain holds its legacy high, as does its raving fans, and the burgers here are good! I just don't love it quite as much as others do."}
{"text":"Had heard of in and out burger but there are none where I live. The menu is simple and they were super busy. Food is very good. The burger is cooked just the way I like it and loaded with all the toppings I like. It was excellent. Fries are ok. That's the only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5. Service was awesome. Didn't take near as long as I would have thought for how busy they were. They will also do you a lettuce wrap if on low carb.  Will definitely be returning for another visit!"}
{"text":"I tried the animal-style fries.  Heart-cloggingly, disgustingly, bad-for-you tasty."}
{"text":"i will say that i don't know what all the craze is about in-n-out ... their burgers are ok. for me they are too greasy. and just because they have a secret menu doesn't make their food any better. i go to this one in particular mostly because it is convenient. and the staff is friendly. service like with most in-n-out's is good but it take a long time to get your order ... not necessarily fast food."}
{"text":"The five stars is because this is the BEST fast food burger joint in the USA.  The food is hot and fresh, the menu is small so it keeps things simple and dang if the burgers are mouthwatering delicious.  This is the best thing to come out of california next to fake boobs.  Parking is a pain, and there is usually a line (inside).  Avoid at all costs at lunchtime, it's PACKED, and that includes the drive-thru.  If you can't stand the line, there many alternatives within walking distance.  Oh, and get a milkshake!"}
{"text":"Service was MUCH faster than the last time I was here a few years prior.  I love the burgers, so yummy I could eat 3.  Lunchtime is a little too busy for me, the lines are too long so I'd avoid it between 11:30-1:00pm."}
{"text":"When we are in Las Vegas we always come to an IN and OUT burger. This place is jammed packed all the time. You see so much people ordering food. This place has the best deals for a meal. The food is always so fresh and good.  Order a meal it comes with fries and a medium drink.  I love the cheeseburgers here. Next time I will try a double double.. It looks pretty good.  Staff do there best to keep this place clean you see them cleaning the door windows. Thats awesome. To have a clean establishment.  Staff are friendly and nice. I give them credit to keep up with all those orders you really dont wait long for your meal. They have a cute uniform tooooooo..."}
{"text":"In California, I would make a pilgrimage the nearest In-N-Out Burger.  This normally meant at a minimum an hour road trip.  I pass In-N-In Out everyday and have to exercise incredible restraint or else I would weigh 400 pounds and that would not be good.  Tests of courage involving eating copious amounts of Double Doubles were met with ease in the early years.  I personal best is three.  Now the game is to be smarter than my ego and stomach.  I eat for quality instead of quantity.  Double Double Animal Style and that's it.  Maybe I eat all the fries and maybe I don't.  I just was to enjoy this juicy fresh master piece of a cheese burger.  Google the secret menu and see what amazing treats and additions you can add.  THis location is very efficient even when they are slammed.  The two things that never change are the taste of the burger and the very pleasant employes."}
{"text":"My third experience with In-N-Out and again, the food is CHEAP for the amount that you get and decent food quality. I ordered just a hamburger with extra lettuce, tomatoes and grilled onions (not animal style, but my personal style) and it came out to about 4$! The burger looked beautiful when it came with all the beautiful toppings peaking through and when I bit into it, the top bun was warm but the bottom was cold. The bun was also a little bit hard and the meat was quite eager compared to Shake Shack. Even so, I was gladly satisfied at this must go West Coast USA joint."}
{"text":"Cheap and a good amount of food for a good price but the quality makes it clear why. If course, we got the animal style fries, a double double burger, an animal style burger and an animal style cheese burger. For four people, this was enough because of how filling all the sauces made everything. Classic greasy, unhealthy fast food but must visit when in america."}
{"text":"It's fast food no matter how you look at it but I love the double double animal style and the milkshakes, the French fries I personally don't care for but they're always friendly and the employees always have a smile"}
{"text":"I'm a start off by saying that in and out burgers are really good the reason I didn't give it a five star it was because when I went in to get the fries they were very salty. And they were also a little under cook. That is why I gave it a three star. Everything else was good especially for my first time. I heard this in and out is not so good but they do have different ones that are a lot better. I am yet to go try them out but I will let you guys know. Another thing I noticed is that the lines inside and the drive-through are always long. Burgers are a good decent size and will get you full. I had a strawberry milkshake and it was nice and thick. I really like the strawberry milkshake I want to try next time the vanilla and the chocolate milkshake."}
{"text":"Thank you Las Vegas Strip. First time having this in California a few years ago with the secret menu... returning again in Las Vegas and having some crazy animal style!! Great burger for what it is. Always room for In N Out!! Try and snag a fancy sticker while your there...."}
{"text":"This is a very busy place for high school kids since the restaurant is open until 1am in the morning.  Great place to hang out with friends for quick bites to eat.  My usual order is 1 hamburger with grilled onions, 2 fries, and cup of water.  Haven't tried the secret menu or any animal style food yet, but heard that they were even better than the original food.  All food were never frozen before, so everything is fresh, especially the fresh cut fries with a bit seasoned salt on it.  Excellent meal and great and fast service every time I go there."}
{"text":"Love the food, especially the fries where it's peeled and cut daily, never frozen potatoes.  Everything is so perfect here and up to you on what you want and don't want on your burgers.  It gets super busy lunch and dinner time, so be ready to wait up to 10 minutes for your food after you order.  Must try!"}
{"text":"The food and service is great for such a busy location.  This is the best run restaurant chain."}
{"text":"I will miss those amazing animal fries. This place is awesome. Just try it and enjoy if your a burger person."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what I'm going to do when I move back to the east coast! Protein style burgers are my favorite thing about In & Out! They are so so good!   This location pretty much always has a line but it's worth it! Ask for the special sauce on the side if you don't like it to be dripping ;)  Check out the secret menu online for some cool new things to order"}
{"text":"Oh IN-N-Out how I adore you! This is probably what I was most excited about eating on my recent trip to Las Vegas and of course it did not disappoint! Great burger, choc shake and fries. Pair that with the amazing service and you couldn't be happier. I love how you can trade in your bun and have your cheeseburger wrapped in lettuce. They have this technique mastered and I didn't feel guilty about indulging in fries and a chocolate shake. I hope I make it out to the West Coast soon so I can enjoy some IN-N-Out again."}
{"text":"Always packed but always fast! I love the Service and the food. If you haven't tried innnout you haven't lived yet!"}
{"text":"Who isn't a fan of In N Out Burger? One of the best burger spots in the world. Very traditional and classy. Animal style fries and neopolitan shakes are amazing for the taste buds.  Unlike other fast food restaurants, In N Out Burger cooks all orders fresh and in a clear visible site. No preheated beef patties or left over ffries from the last customers.  This location is convenient to people of the Centennial area. Only downside I had about my visit is that they have the thermostat set on \"blizzard\"! It was colder than a polar bears toenails in this building lol."}
{"text":"Nothing different at this location.  Still great service in a nice location off the freeway.  Will definitely be back when we crave the best simple burger, fries, and shake in the world!"}
{"text":"I just don't get it. Flavorless dry meat, wilted lettuce and semi stale buns. For the price point, it's about on par with other fast food, but you can get equivalent or better at Wendy's or BK. The fries we had we almost inedible. Soggy, almost no potato flavor and the overpowering aroma of sunflower oil that was past its time.   I know I'll probably take a beating for this review from the In n Out fans, but seriously guys, this is not fresh, bottom of the low end fast food. I've tried In n Out 5 times over the last 2 years, hoping I can figure out the hype and it's just gotten worse and worse."}
{"text":"How can you not like In-n-Out? Their burgers are how I imagined the Krabby Patty as a kid! It's crazy cheap, customizable and delicious. I personally get a double double with extra toast and extra grilled onions. Add some fries with that and it comes out to $5! If I'm feeling really hungry I bump up my order to a 3x3 or a 4x4. Sadly, they won't allow you to order more than that :(  Tip: get your French fries well done you'll never regret it"}
{"text":"I had just gotten into the area, and I was starving. Most places in town were closed by the time I went scavenging for food. Luckily, there was an In-N-Out about a 12-minute drive from the hotel. I pulled up to the drive thru and ordered my usual: 3x0. I washed it down with some iced tea. The burger actually tasted more fresh than the locations I frequent back in LA. When I came here, it was around 1:00AM, so it was virtually empty. The staff was friendly and efficient. The surrounding area was peaceful and safe. I'll be stopping by here before the drive back to LA."}
{"text":"I usually love love love the service at in n out but going in at 9:30 on a Friday night was a mistake I guess. Savanna took our order standing outside because of the crowd and she was in an incredibly snobby mood! I don't think I've ever encountered a snobby employee at In N Out in my entire life. Not cool. We drove up to the window(s) and Cody AND Adam were super friendly and made us feel better about the situation. But I'm bothered enough to be writing it in this review. So hopefully Savannah gets put on something else besides taking orders because that is not her thing."}
{"text":"I loveee In-N-Out, wish they had one on the East Coast, but damn was the wait to get my order taking forever. So many people waiting! The whole place was packed. I'm just glad I got my order and my friends found a place for us to sit. Other than that, the food was yummy! Only food issue was that the animal fries were too salty and me and my friends barely ate half of our orders of fries"}
{"text":"After all the hype this place was just average at best.  On the east coast we have so many great options for burgers.  I guess out west there are not many choices.  Five guys & elevation burger both beat In-N-Out and they are just average around here.  Even though the burgers aren't fantastic they are a great late night option.  The fries are fresh cut and tasty."}
{"text":"Great customer service-especially dining room person-offered help, refills and removing trash."}
{"text":"Its a great place to grab fast food! Definitely more tastier then Barf Donalds! I always get protein style burger with no cheese, its for the carb conscious, diet people like me..LOL This spot is fast and very friendly."}
{"text":"It almost feels pointless to review In N Out on  Yelp. What can be said that hasn't already been said? And regardless of what people on Yelp say or don't say, In N Out will always be packed. In n Out should just be given 5 stars on Yelp permanently. Anyone who gives it less than 5 stars should not be allowed to review restaurants.   But now that they are on the Strip in Las Vegas, it behooves me to add yet another 5 star review in the hopes of helping fellow tourists find the best casual food option on the Strip.  In N Out is the gold standard by which all other fast food restaurants should be measured. They value their customers and not just in a lip service type of way. Their restaurants are clean, bright, and shiny. They have a staff of smiling, hustling, efficient workers who can move long lines that would have caused a catastrophic meltdown at other restaurants. They will not compromise on the quality or freshness of their product. They only have a couple items on the menu so that they can do their thing (burgers and fries) and do it exceedingly well. Their burgers are everything that people hype them up to be and more. And \"fairly priced\" doesn't even do justice to their prices because they could DOUBLE their prices and I would still go there the same amount without batting an eye.   Unsurprisingly, I found this location is the same as all of the other In N Outs I have been to in terms of the above qualities. Go. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers!  They have the best in town.  Only place I would get a milk shake."}
{"text":"Being from New Orleans & just moved to Vegas, had to check out this joint. Its okay nothing special fries are air thin if that makes sense lol. I never get the thousand island sauce. Overrall, I've had better burgers but you cant beat the affordable price."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru and had the best experience with Cristal!! She gave us extra ketchup and chili peppers and was so nice about it!!! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Really can life be this perfect? The only wish, was it was healthy as well. Great burgers, fries this time tasted a bit odd ( thus the four stars). Out the door for like $5.00!!! What... Why can't they be on the east coast?"}
{"text":"This is the best burger place in America!!! The food is always perfect and the employees are very nice. I eat in n out more than all other fast food restaurants combined and i love giving them my money. I suggest trying a number 1 with whole grilled onions and chillis, its the best thing in the world."}
{"text":"What can I say about In-N-Out burger that people don't already know? I think they've mastered the art of the drive-through burger joint.   Double Double, protein style, with onions. Animal fries. Optional strawberry shake. It always comes out the same way (delicious), it's always fresh, the staff is always polite and helpful. I don't think I've ever had a bad experience at an In-N-Out in my whole life.   Top marks for consistency and deliciousness."}
{"text":"Nathan was super nice. Love his attitude. I always look for good customer service and in n out never lets me down. Food is always good here too !"}
{"text":"Just because it doesn't have meat, doesn't mean it's a \"veggie burger\". Lettuce (and onion, upon request) on a bun doesn't make it a burger.   It's quite the sham. The fries and shakes may be good, but disappointing overall to anyone who cares about what they eat."}
{"text":"Great food, the place is always jumping but the orders come quick and the staff is always smiling and professional no matter how crazy it gets during the lunchtime rush. Special shout out to one worker in particular - I think her name is Luz. Greets everybody walking in the door like it's her family restaurant and works the front and back room like she had too many cups of coffee. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Of fast food burger joints few places are as well known in areas where they have absolutely no store presence as the chain \"In-N-Out Burger\". While visiting Arizona on a business trip I was aware In-N-Out Burger was a fixture in the area, and it had been well over a decade since the last time I had stopped at one.   Since my first pair of visits to In-N-Out Burgers in California in the early 2000s, I've seen people wearing In-N-Out Burger shirts, read countless articles about the chain, and decided the next time I'm near one I'll give it another shot. My feeling in previous visits to In-N-Out was that while good, and inexpensive there was nothing exceptional about the food there. Would I notice something I didn't before?  When I arrived at my hotel in Tempe Arizona I was immediately able to spot an In-N-Out location and visited several times during my two week stay. On my initial visit I ordered a 3x3 which is three beef patties and three slices of cheese served \"Animal style\" which is with lettuce, tomato, the beef patties being mustard cooked; pickle, extra Thousand Island style sauce known as \"spread\" with grilled onions. I also got Lemonade and animal style fries which added spread and onions to the top of my fries. Overall, I thought the burger was very good, especially for the price, but that even with the spread the fries were a bit lacking.   My next visit I went in a slightly different direction, passed on getting any fries and just got a regular 3x3 burger without the animal style additions and a chocolate shake. I noticed that besides the lettuce, tomato and onions it didn't taste as different as I thought it would. I also obtained this through the drive-thru and was given a box rather than a bag, making it somewhat difficult to transport without spilling. The shake I had was excellent, and while I was in the area I tried vanilla,chocolate and strawberry shakes and all were good.  My overall opinion of In-N-Out is this, if you've never visited one it isn't the legendary once in a lifetime experience you may have heard about. However, it is very good for fast food and is quite inexpensive. The most unique characteristic of getting an animal style In-N-Out burger is that it is unique tasting. Nothing exactly tastes quite like an In-N-Out burger, the sharp onions and more sour than big mac sauce thousand island spread give the burger its character. It might not be the best tasting fast food burger ever, but it has its own identity. I am going to give In-N-Out four stars."}
{"text":"What can you say?????   Ive been to 6 contries and all over the USA. This is the best fast food burger in the world."}
{"text":"Second time in Vegas, so second time at an INO location. The first location I went to over two years ago was a little far from the Strip. So I was surprised to see this new-ish location here. But on to the food: delicious! No trip out to the West isn't complete without a stop to INO. Burgers are a perfect size and seasoned very well. Fries are average, but add their signature sauce to it and it'll make a little difference. Long lines may scare some, but it's seriously worth waiting. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Heard about this chain for years. So I had to check out the hype. My burger was great and had had the urge to stop here numerous times before I went back home. The pricing wasn't too bad either. Paid about 10 bucks for one meal and an extra burger. This place is near the Strip, so expect a huge crowd."}
{"text":"Another decent burger joint off the strip, just in back of the New York hotel casino. Fresh burger, problem always crowded and the meat patty is small. I like the free refill choices of soda and lemonade. Better price than shake shack"}
{"text":"Overrated."}
{"text":"Pretty upset with my visit earlier today. On our way out of Vegas my husband and I were pretty hungry so decided to stop by In-N-Out, since they never seem to disappoint. We were wrong :( He ordered. Double meat animal style and I ordered a cheeseburger animal style ketchup instead of spread.   Once our food arrived my husband noticed he did not receive grilled onions, nor did we get fried mustard on either of our burgers. It was 10:20am, they weren't busy...not sure why they got our simple order wrong. Although our fries were the best part of the meal, we will no longer come to this location. (Two stars for the nice employee who took our order)."}
{"text":"Visited Las Vegas last weekend and I was excited to try this place! The line was long, but it moved quickly. Also the food is cheap and tasty! Can't wait to have it again one day."}
{"text":"haha yes this place is the *insert adult word here*  but add to this i would have to say in all of my In N Out excursion Ive never had a bad experience always friendly and always make the best fast food burgers and animal fries around....needless to say if you haven't gone to an in n out.....well your over due.... =)"}
{"text":"Best fries because they are fresh. Protien burgers and x x x burgers are fun. Secret menu is the bomb."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, and they customized my burger with no sauce or onions just right. We even saw them making fresh fries with real potatoes. Definitely at the top of the fast food chain."}
{"text":"The food was fine. I'm a tourist so I thought in-n-out was special, but honestly it's like McDonald's but with a smaller selection of food. Between the two, I'd go for McDonald's."}
{"text":"Went to In-N-Out Burger for the first time ever. I walked up to the counter and the cashier was great. He gave me a sticker, hats, and patiently helped me pick my order.  Also, the place was packed. However, the wait was minimal and the staff were so nice.  Burgers are great. I love the onions and sauce."}
{"text":"It's been over 4 years since I had first tried In-N-Out Burger when I had went to Los Angeles. I've literally craved going back out west for one of their burgers ever since then...Vegas granted me that opportunity and once again they delivered!   Good God, how I love the burgers and fries here and In-N-Out. From the juiciness of the burgers, to the fries made to damn near perfection to the In-N-Out Sauce, there is NOTHING I can say against the food at In-N-Out, I don't care if it was only my second time eating their food. Only thing about this one in particular that keeps it from being a 5 is...the VERY long wait to get my food. I will admit, when my friend and I were here which was around 6pmish it was very crowded here with no seating left. Luckily she got there before me and saved us a seat but damn...literally waited close to 25 minutes for my food and only ordered two things. Hopefully the service gets better but other than that, In-N-Out, you still reign supreme to me with the best burgers in the country."}
{"text":"I've been here twice on business trips from KC, and this was my first stop from the airport on the latest one.  The fries are incredible, and the burger quality is rivaled by few.  The onions are a great addition to the overall package, but the sauce is what keeps me from going 5 stars."}
{"text":"No In N Out in Hawaii, so when you see people posting there burger and fries, of course this was on my 'to eat' list on my vacay! Customer service was excellent! With how busy this place was, it was really clean. Love how the workers who prepare the food used gloves! You don't see that often! The burger and fries (both animal style) was amazeballs!! I seriously wish we had a joint in Hawaii!"}
{"text":"Delicious as always.  Drive thru was a bit slow. Not the restaurants fault I believe.  Someone must have change/added to their order and screwed us all."}
{"text":"Words cannot express how much I enjoyed my meal at In-N-Out Burger.   I already knew going to the West Coast that this was one of the places I just HAD to pass by. Surely enough, after arriving to Vegas from a delayed flight all the way from New York City, I went with friends to indulge in some In-N-Out.  I ordered the cheeseburger combo \"animal style\", which is one of the options they have on their secret menu. The sauce made my burger that much more juicy & enjoyable. The fries were very different in comparison to anything I had ate before, which makes sense since I had never enjoyed fresh fries from an establishment.   The location itself had tons of seating, either indoor or outdoor (by the gift shop). It was very clean for a fast-food joint.   What I couldn't believe were the prices at In-N-Out! My whole meal (burger, fries, & drink) came out to less than $6, which is very hard to believe.   I will definitely be going back to In-N-Out burger whenever I am in the west coast. I look forward to trying out more items from the secret menu, as well."}
{"text":"I have always had good experiences with this restaurant. The menu selection is about as small as it gets but the quality of in-n-out burgers is always the best. I strongly recommend the protein-style burger for those who are immediately turned off by the idea of burgers being unhealthy. The bun is replaced with a lettuce wrap."}
{"text":"Not much of a wait for a burger. I like to get them \"protein style\"....helps if you are watching the carb intake or not eating bread. Still super delicious and tasty."}
{"text":"Ok. Not bad. Had better. Hamburger 2 buns, lettuce,  tomato,  n Thousand island dressing,  home fries. It was fine."}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out and I have been a fan since my days working in LA County.  This location is nice and the employees are very industrious and provide very good service. Where I struggle here is in the lack of consistency I get in my food. At times, my burger will be over seasoned. These burgers have a unique taste to them and it's hard not to notice a salty patty. The last time I indulged here, the burger was excellent, yet, the fries were a little tuff or dry. I distinctly remember looking at the clock and then realized that the restaurant had open for business not more than 15 minutes. Why would my fries be subpar?  I love their business model and I recognize that we all have to train and learn on the job. It's awesome to see a company employ so many young people and be dedicated to quality. I just wish my food were consistently good. :("}
{"text":"Staff is always nice and they don't mind little things like making my fries well done! Parking lot can be a little funky. Like every other In And Out, this place is ALWAYS crowded. Line goes fast."}
{"text":"This is the one location where they have excellent customer service, food and it always looks clean. I can come in first or be the last one in here at the end of the night the employees are always double checking to see if everything is going good. My 4x4 are never made sloppy unlike other locations and I walk out a happy camper which is the reason why I come back to this location in town."}
{"text":"living in las vegas for about 12 years i know to stay away from this in-n-out due to all the tourists go here but i was riding home with one of my brothers and we were hungry and right by here so we stopped in. this place was PACKED, there must have been 50+ people in line and i thought oh well we are here already. let me tell you this place is a well oiled machine, the line only took like 5 or ten min and then another 10 for the food. the animal style frys were worth the wait!!! so if you ever wander in here dont be scared it will take a little longer than a empty dining room but wasn't horrible."}
{"text":"I find myself at In-and-Out often due to it's accessibility and for serving great burgers. If I am ever out at night and looking for a fix, I can be sure the nearest In-N-Out can satisfy my late night cravings. This location in particular has never failed to meet my expectations. Anyone looking for a good classic burger and fries meal will find themselves quick friends with In-N-Out Burger.  In-N-Out Burger is a good example of simple done right, where ordering can be as easy as 1, 2, or 3. There is no need to complicate their menu with fluff, They have their double-double burger, the classic cheeseburger, and hamburger, along with fries, drinks, and shakes, and thats it. Their menu is simple allowing you to pick out a classic, burger, fries, and a drink meal quickly or you can choose from their simple #1,2,3 meals. Don't let the simple menu fool you into thinking you can't have any variety. You may have heard that there exists a not so secret  \"secret menu\" which lets you add a special spin to your burger or fries if you're the daring type. The food is always appealing when presented to you whether it's for dining in or to go. The pricing modest when compared to other fast food places but will surely get you a top-notch meal nonetheless.  Located close to Chandler mall and a Harkins Theater, the place is an attractive outing for anyone after a day at the mall, and extremely attractive for young adults after a night out thanks to them being open late hours. I find myself here with my friends often after a movie night, and instead of going through the hassle of looking for any place sill open that late, we have absolutely no problem settling for In-n-Out. As a frequent late-night customer of this In-N-Out, I enjoy the lively atmosphere this place has no matter what the time.  The service is about as good as it gets from a fast food restaurant. You can't ask for more,  The cashiers and rest of the staff are always friendly and helpful, with a well kept dining area. The food comes out in a reasonable amount of time for both the drive through and inside, no matter what you end up getting. It can also be appreciated that they never freeze, pre-package, or microwave your food, the kitchen is open letting you see the food prepared for yourself.  My personal dinings at In-n-Out have always been pleasant, the food, price, atmosphere, and service, all come together and makes the experience great."}
{"text":"What can I say, we don't have it at home so we eat as much as we can when we're hear ! LOL I think it's the meat to bun ratio that makes it taste good. I wish we had one in our city ! We be back !"}
{"text":"I live in California so i always get to eat In N Out but overall this is a good place only seats are very limited and no one wants to eat outside in the hot sun!"}
{"text":"This might be the most ridiculous In-N-Out ever due to the massive neon sign along I-15.  Having grown up in San Diego, I'm no stranger to In-N-Out.  The burgers are great.  Well worth the wait for something that's truly made fresh in a fast food atmosphere.  I also love the shakes.  Too bad they're only served in one size.  Or maybe that's a good thing for my calorie count.  This particular location is always packed.  I drive home around midnight every night and I've stopped through the drive-through and it's a solid 10 minute process or more.  I'm not sure if it's a tourist thing being near the strip, but this one is slower than most.  That's saying something since most In-N-Outs are always busy.  I'd suggest the In-N-Out in the northwest part of town for faster service.  The only thing I am not impressed with are the fries.  I hardly ever get fries here.  It's a waste of time.  And of course there's the famed secret menu.  Look it up on the internets and you can find out how to get a grilled cheese and the like.  Good times."}
{"text":"Crowdy but still very quick in delivering my order. Waiters finally smiling. The food is very good, fries seem to be let greasy so...different taste but they are good. I'll go back to this place again"}
{"text":"In the word's of Spongebob Square Pants, \"I'M READY!\" After ten months of more Mcdonald's than I've probably eaten in the past ten years, I'm ready to leave Australia and return to my home country, the meca of fast food.   Though, I am an avid fan of the New American cuisine (vegan friendly & fair trade) I WANT SOME MEAT. I've made a list of all the fast food spots I plan on hitting up upon arrival back to the states.   This list reads as follows:   1. In N Out 2. Whataburger 3. Wendy's 4. Taco Bell   As you can see, In N Out's my number one and this is simply because it's the best. It's funny to see that Mickey D's isn't even on the list when I shamefully admit that my roommates and I eat there maybe once or twice a week.. gross, I know.   Last night over a double hamburger, fries, and a sundae all for 9 dollars, I began explaining In N Out to my house mate. In N Out isn't a place you go for just anything, most people know exactly what they like and order just that, time and time again.   Though the menu is small and simple the big tastes explain it all. The patty's aren't large in any way but the fresh lettuce, tomato, and onion combined make their burgers hard to get a proper bite in your mouth all at once.   I'm not the biggest fan of the fries so I usually opt away from them and snag a couple of my friends though I have come to In N Out alone before (which is not pathetic on any level). So yeah, like I said I get the same thing every time switching back and forth between their delicious lemonade and milkshakes. The good thing about this location is the Yogurtland in the lot right next door. So if you ever see me around the Grigio, dont be surprised if I head over for some dessert after my 'gourmet meal'.  Note for vegetarians: If you're a vego you can order off the secret special menu. This menu is not spoken about, kinda like that guy on Harry Potter who's name shouldn't be said out loud. If you know about the menu and order it theres no problem but there's no chance you're getting an employee to tell you about it! Sorry, I won't be sharing their secrets here but if you're interested definitely look up their secrets online!  Since I've been living in Australia, I've realized how condiments aren't that big over here and find it frustrating how they charge you 50 cents for dipping sauce. Sometimes I can't be bothered spending extra on sauce since even Macca's is an expensive meal but baby do I love me some sauce. In N Out's, Special Sauce is so delicious and definitely worth the extra money for a packet. Though its probably just a mixture of mayo and ketchup (kinda like big mac sauce) it's an essential add on.   This is fast food but you shouldn't expect it to be quick and easy. Every time I go to In N Out, there's a drive thru line through the parking lot. Thankfully, they've got employees who wear goofy outfits standing outside with Ipads sending your order in when the drive thru is like this.  I understand I may have gotten peoples hopes up but I suggest going into your first In N Out experience with low expectations. I was honestly so dissapointed after my first try at an In N Out near LAX maybe Arizona's In N Out's are just better? I think I had just gotten my own hopes up but whatever the reason was for it to be so bad, I swear after my second try I became addicted."}
{"text":"We always love In-N-Out Burger, and this experience was not an exception!  My husband I live on the East Coast, so any time we're out west, In-N-Out is on our list of places to eat.  I'm not a big burger fan, but I love their burgers.  You can taste the high-quality, fresh ingredients in every single bite.  The food isn't too greasy, and the fries are out of this world!  I would highly recommend getting french fries \"animal style\", with their amazing sauce, melted cheese, and bacon.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"In and out is pretty simple, fast, and cheap for a pretty good burger. The people who work there are all very nice and the food is pretty good for fast food. For me it was hyped up way too much before I went so my experience might have been a little bit of a letdown, however the burger I got was pretty good and tasted fresh. ***make sure when you order the fries to ask for them \"crispy\" or else they come out pretty soggy and do not taste that good at all. Also you might want to check out the \"not so secret\" menu online and look at other options you have when ordering. Please don't forget this place is a Fast Food joint so don't expect a gourmet burger, just an affordable burger that might be a slight step above some other fast food joints. Oh and the menu has only a few options (no chicken sandwiches just burgers and cheeseburgers as well as fries and shakes)."}
{"text":"If you're visiting Vegas, you have to stop at In n Out! Every time I'm here it's SO packed (especially if you go to a location near the strip), but everything is made fresh, and it's amazing food! It's so worth the wait.   If you're new to in n out look up the secret menu! It's worth it! :)"}
{"text":"Oh, how I miss you, In N Out. I miss your toasted buns, your never frozen beef. I miss your \"eat 'em while they're hot\" fries that go down easier than the lard covered potatoes at other fast food joints. I miss the hand-leafed lettuce that isn't wilting or slimy. The cheese that has melted so perfectly just for me. The thousand island that makes it all come together. I really miss the anticipation of driving to In N Out, knowing my food will always be amazing and satisfying.  You will always be in my heart. Please visit me in Oregon some day."}
{"text":"My wife and I walked 2.5 miles to the Sahara location and 2.5 miles back in 100 degree heat. We had heard so much about I&O B so we finally tried them.  Burgers were a 6 and fries were a 3 (My wife gave the burgers a 4 and fries a 1).  Pitiful, especially when reflecting back on all the raves from people for years.  The staff was friendly and the place was busy.  The lettuce and bun were good.  As soon as I saw the price, I felt I gained an understanding why people think it is good...because they think it is a bargain?  I hit local fast food joints - Jack in the Box, McDonald's, Sonic and Wendy's this past week as a comparison and all were much better at the same price point.  I&O B is not even in the top 50 burger joints.  However, at least now I can say I have tried it and can engage in discussion about I & O B."}
{"text":"I like In and Out, but today was unique. My daughter wanted a cheeseburger, no onion, lettuce or tomatoes. The girl taking our order seemed confused... In fact I felt like I was talking to her on a cell phone when in actuality it was person to person. I might have contributed this to my amazing charm, but I realized she was just unable to comprehend the order as simple as it was... One more reason she should stay  in school."}
{"text":"This review is only for the Alma In-N-Out. I don't eat much fast food but when I do, In-N-Out is my go to....healthIER and fresher. I've been an In-N-Out customer for 37 years (since I got my own car). This In-N-Out though always has the longest lines (I think it is due to the incredibly slow service) which isn't the worst part. I got a piece of beef jerky in my burger! (my poetic license) It was the thinnest burger patty I have seen in my life (literally) most likely because of being way overdone (hence the long wait?) I should have complained to a manager but did not actually see my jerky patty until I got home. I stick to the Stapley location now."}
{"text":"Never will I make another trip to Vegas without getting my double double fix! These burger and just plain juicy, saucy, meaty and  onion goodness. They are so close yet so far, just two states from me?? what gives??"}
{"text":"After shopping nearby... this In-N-Out Burger really hits the spot. Parking lot can be a hassle however once you get in you are golden. Just gotta brave the wait for me 3x3 because the drive thru is usually very long. I'm never bothered by the line at In-N-Out Burger because it's expected. I change up my burger each time depending on my mood. Sometimes I get animal style or sliced raw onions they have many options for such a limited menu. You just can't go wrong with In-N-Out Burger. They actually remember to give you place mats at this location too."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week. I am lucky to have been eating IN&OB my whole life while people who grew up here in Vegas like my wife have not been. IN&OB first expanded outside of California to Las Vegas in 1992. Kids today wont know what it was like to not have a IN&OB as it should be! The employees at this location are always friendly and my order is never wrong. Depending on my appetite I will get a 3x3 or a 4x4 with chopped chilies. Today it was a 3x3 with grilled onions and mustard and a side of fries. the inside and bathrooms are always clean. I'm impressed that a place with such a limited menu can make a burger so many ways but IN&OB manages like a champ."}
{"text":"This has to be the In n Out with the shortest drive thru but longest wait times. I'm used to waiting for my food at any In n Out however when there's only 2 cars in the drive thru and it still takes 20 minutes to get your food it's frustrating. Good thing there was a 3x3 at the end of all that! I stop at this location on my lunch break which I schedule so luckily the long wait time isn't an issue as far as getting back to work at a certain time but for some it might be. My burger tasted just as good as the many others I've had in my life and the fries were cooked as I requested."}
{"text":"I am not generally a red meat eater. However, I get my cravings every once in a while. Soo naturally I had to see what all the hype was all about. This location in particular was steadily busy for a Monday night. I did the drive-thru. Looked at the menu and could not believe how cheap it all was. Obviously no complaints there. And the customer service was really nice. They asked if I wanted onion, which I did not. But I wanted pickles and they obliged. They asked if I wanted it packed up to go or if I was gonna eat it in my car as well! I was really surprised by the presentation idk I just feel like fast-food is usually slapped together and it's fine bc those aren't the standards you have. So I was impressed with how nice the burger looked and even more so by the taste. The proportion for the price is unreal. Anyway. It was delicious. You got me in-N-out. And I've heard the fries can be dry but this batch was perfectly crisp and fresh. Very solid first impression! And satisfied my beef craving, for sure"}
{"text":"Always a great burger and love their fries. This location does get crazy busy at times though and we've left because it was too busy.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fresh  food good prices. Meat is small, but you can go 6x6. Secret menu for regulars."}
{"text":"Tried to call this location tonight with a legit drive through issue and, of course, was directed to an 800 number call taker. Edwin answered my call and needed to know which location in Chandler I was referring to because \"there are several in chandler\". I told him the general location and while looking for the address, Edwin decided to hang up on me.  Did I call back? No. No I didn't. Edwin, you're the company rep at that moment in time, and if you don't care - I absolutely couldn't care any less."}
{"text":"My usual orders, 1 hamburger with grilled onions, 2 fries, and 1 cup of water.  Totally love their fresh cut fries, all food here have never been frozen and it's fresh daily.  Love their fast services, however, you might have to wait a bit longer during lunch time and afternoon rush hours.  But it's totally worth the wait.  They also have a secret menu food that you'll have to ask them to make for you.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"Love the food here, especially the fries.  So fresh and crunchy.  Can't get it anywhere else."}
{"text":"So happy for having In and Out in the strip. Always great quality, very fast service with great staff and gosh delicious cheese burger with my favorite chilly peppers and for sure sweet price for late dinner."}
{"text":"Most ridiculous wait ever! I'm sorry but I go to in n out in multiple states and 40 minutes for drive through with only 10 cars is not fast food nor ok. I would have driven over the curb to leave had there been that option! Unbelievable! Wasted $100 of my time by not being able to work"}
{"text":"The Gold Standard of fast food burger chains. You really can't beat the value (quality for price) you get from going to In-N-Out Burger, especially when compared to other Vegas eateries. Make sure to study up on the \"Secret Menu\" to prevent yourself from saying, \"That's it?\", when looking at the menu for the first time. If you only remember two words, let them be \"Animal Style\".  Good: Price and Quality. Where else in Vegas near the Strip can you get a good quality double burger, fries, and shake for around $7? The workers took their time and showed enthusiasm, which is always a bonus for fast food. Location is close to Strip. If you don't have a car you can still walk there. While it's on the North of West Tropicana Ave. past I-15, take the sidewalk on the South of W. Tropicana Ave. (Excalibur side, not NYNY side) and head West. There is a walkway that loops around the overpass and you can make it there safely via sidewalks/crosswalks. Don't forget about the store on the North side of the restaurant. Very reasonable prices for merchandise.  Cons: It can be busy. Don't try and go during peak times if you are in a hurry. Once you become a regular, newbies will start to annoy you."}
{"text":"A different location but same great service, same great food!   In-N-Out is always busy.  The drive through line is long but moves quickly.  Dining inside is the same.  Long line but again, moves very quickly.   The cashiers here are so friendly.  Service has been on point at every location I've dined at.  It's great to have the consistency across the board.    Burger and fries? Cheap, quick and delicious! My fries I request well done animal style.  Cheese, onions and sauce smothering the fries - I just can't get enough!   As far as fast food burgers, this is my go to place! Love it!"}
{"text":"We definitely wanted to try In-N-Out during our Vegas trip, so we checked this one out on the way back from Red Rock Canyon. It's pretty much everything a burger joint should be, with friendly, fast service, those silly little paper hats, and ingredients that taste really FRESH. They brag about their lettuce being cut the same day and the buns being fresh, and you really can taste the difference.   I wish I could get myself a Double Double and an order of fries back home!"}
{"text":"Went to AZ to check out Stratum Laser Tag up the road, and having grown up in SoCal, had to get INO while there. Their service was great, and, as always, animal style burgers and fries were delectable, as was the shake."}
{"text":"This is a super busy In and Out since it is next to the university but if you get lucky with the wait time and parking you can get a great burger, fries and good shakes. Staff is super friendly, and eating outside is nice weather permitting. Recommend if in area and want a quick burger. They can also make your burger \"protein\" style...so no bun just lettuce wrap if you are cutting out the breads...obviously different then a traditional burger but nice option if you can't or don't eat bread."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm someone who usually doesn't like to unwrap my food, but it's only half wrapped so it makes an exception ;-) Double Double Animal Style... Mmm..."}
{"text":"Block off the drive thru if your closed, don't let people wait on line to say \"oh we already closed\", lame."}
{"text":"I loved in n out and make this location my lunch stop for work pretty often. It's busy but I feel like they really do try to handle the traffic well! Last time I came here, my burger was undercooked and considering it was my only meal of the day, it made me EXTREMELY sick. I've never experienced food poisoning so drastic and miserable and now I have to avoid the smells surrounding this place, otherwise my stomach lurches every time. Great service, but I wish they would pay a little closer attention to their cook times and temperatures."}
{"text":"I have never eaten at one of these places before.  It was packed and after eating on the over priced strip I can see why.  A good burger.  It reminded me of the old time Burger Chef."}
{"text":"Wow this place is super busy and it's not even because it's  Saturday night there just friggin good this place especially they have a girl outside hustlin they're taken orders and putting food out in a timely manner of course always fresh and hot by far this is my favorite in-and-out location"}
{"text":"In-n-Out by far sets the bar above the rest of all fast food. The employees exude customer service, clean uniforms, and great food. Could this because this company believes is paying their employees more than a minimum wage?  Could be a big factor.  It is proof that if you take care of your employees, they will take care of the business."}
{"text":"This in n out is a disappointment. Always getting our order wrong, long wait, and the staff isn't the greatest."}
{"text":"Besides how great the price is for a burger, fries and a shake which only cost like 7 bucks for everything. In-N-Out  Burger is by far one of  worst burger joints I've been to.    My friends and I came all the way from Philadelphia to Las Vegas for a Bachelor Party.  We stopped in In-N-Out for a bite to eat before we hit the strip.  We ended up waiting a half an hour just to eat.  This place was pack tight.  There could have been fire code violations for how crammed it was in this place.  I figured it must be good if I am waiting this long. So I waited and waited and pretty much waited some more.   Order Numbers where all over the place. Order number 56, 48, 27, 57, 58, 69 etc.... It gets a bit frustrating when you think your next but in reality your not even close.    Finally I got my burger and sat down with my friends hoping for a delicious bite of a juicy burger.  My first bite was pretty much my last.  Figuring to buy a double it would be big enough to fill my appetite but that wasn't the case.  The burger was fresh but not that great in a taste category.  My milk shake was the thickest milk shake in the world.  It coated my throat with a chocolaty mess, which it ended up giving me a stomachache.    By far the best thing to order was their french fries.  They are made from real potatoes and you can watch the fri-guy put the potatoes in a contraption and cut them up.    Other then crappy burgers and horrible milk shakes, I would hold off and not  waste your time just to get some decent fries.  Stick with paying a little extra and getting something better.    My Vegas trip could have done with out In-N-Out."}
{"text":"These burgers are fantastic - made fresh, good ingredients and very tasty. Their prices are very reasonable too. Fries are hand cut and very good too. Would eat here more often if it was closer to home. Favorite place for a simple burger lunch."}
{"text":"Nothing much to add about the food. Drove through today at midnight. It was quiet. Had to wait for a few minutes for my food but at least I know they were made fresh. And the staff was very friendly and always smiling."}
{"text":"When I crave a good old fashioned burger, this is where I go.  They stick to what they know, and that's a great thing.  Simplicity is a virtue lost in the burger world.  They have a simple menu, but each item on that menu is expertly made.  They don't have \"fancy-schmancy\" \"foo-foo\" burgers here.    The food is prepared and cooked to order.  If ever there was fast food that tastes fresh, In-N-Out Burger is it.  The dining area is kept very clean.  The staff is friendly.  When the weather is agreeable, their outside dining area is perfect.  The drive-thru service is excellent.  Sometimes, it can be a bit of a wait, but that's a small price to pay for perfection."}
{"text":"Really great burgers! I love that I am able to get a burger \"protein style\" (which just means no bun/but wrapped in lettuce.) The lettuce is always crisp and fresh, the burger is cooked to perfectly and I am a fan of their \"special sauce\" which is 1000 Island'ish sauce. So good! Sometimes simple is best, and they so burgers right. Their fries are equally tasty, though I like to get mine well-done so they are extra crispy. *Side note: If you like their sauce, try the fries \"Animal Style\" it is pretty awesome!  All in all: great staff, great burgers & fries and clean restaurant.   Minor down fall is sometimes their lines (both indoor & drive-thru) get crazy busy. So you may have to patiently wait for your meal."}
{"text":"Awesome as usual. Keep the menu small and perfect it. They understand that. I just wish I could get a franchise up here in Seattle."}
{"text":"I AM a cheap date. This was worth the trip - if you have wheels. A stellar burger and fry experience, espec. after a nice loooong hike at Red Rock Canyon. Also, $10 for lunch allows you to spend $300+ on dinner, apparently. Maybe I'm not a cheap date. Well. Only in Vegas."}
{"text":"Always a fan since I was introduced to it in California. So grateful that they are in Las Vegas and have expanded. Probably one of the tasty burgers especially when you add grilled onions. For the bigger order you can order a 3x3 or 4x4 patty. I usually order with no salt on the patty, lettuce tomato, cheese and grill onions only and they do a great job. I also get fries well done not salt and sometimes with cheese and grill onions. Anytime I have a craving its a cheap eat to satisfy the palate. BTW: If you're going to eat bad mine as well go all the way and wash it down with a soda. I can always trust In-n-out to do a great job of filling my order. If you are from the east coast or Midwest, you have to try one of these burgers."}
{"text":"I just waited in line for close to 20 minutes. All I wanted was a well done warm burger. Got home and nope, cold burger and fries and probably the rawest meat they had available. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Yes, we all know that In-N-Out is a fast food chain.  Just like McDonald's or Burger King.  They just redefine what it's like to be a fast food chain.  Yes, a fast food chain doesn't have to be bad in quality. It's an eye-opening moment you feel on the first bite at this family owned west coast chain.  Quality is good, pricing is right, not-so-secret custom menus are fun, anything about this burger joint is awesome, except one thing - they are SUPER BUSY all the time, which almost disqualifies this place as a fast food destination.  But I wouldn't blame them for doing the right thing and its natural consequences."}
{"text":"Paid a visit to this In-n-Out when I had a craving for a burger. Don't ask why. I was REAAAALLY hungry. Yikes.   So, for my one horrible unhealthy meal for the week, I chose this.  Cheeseburger. Animal Style. Toast. Fries. Diet Coke (Since I'm watching my figure). It was effing delicious.   I did the drive through thing. I waited the customary five minutes, but everything came out FRESH to order, especially the fries. No salt on the fries, which is how I like it. I can salt them as I see fit.   Also, everything was packaged just the way I like it.  In-N-Out....you are what a hamburger is all about."}
{"text":"Delicious. Amazing like every in and out. Highly recommend if you are hungry and in the area. Very busy, probably because it tastes so good! Received excellent service from Melissa."}
{"text":"This is the OG location. It's busy pretty much anytime it's open. The lines move along quicker here than you'd think because they have enough staff on hand to handle the long lines. There is also a gift shop next door  to this location so you can get your in n out merch without paying shipping fees. I hadn't been to this location in a minute because I experienced some issues with my order not being correct which is hardly the case with in n out but I have been by recently several times and it's been on point. I ask for my burger different ways depending on what sounds good each time and my order has been just the way I order it. I go inside sometimes but the drive thru works best for me because getting a place to sit inside at this location can take longer than it takes to get your food more times than not. Being near the strip and one of the first recognizable signs coming into Vegas it's a given that this place will be popping. If you like chilies then ask for chopped chilies on your burger and thank me later."}
{"text":"Great, consistent cheese burgers. Probably ounce for ounce the best quality to price ratio on the burger market. There are worse burgers for higher prices. Love it because it's simple and straightforward."}
{"text":"No french fries that we paid for when we got home but when I called customer service they were happy to fix the issue. So please double check your order so your burger has the company of fries"}
{"text":"for those non beef eaters who still want to experience in-n-out with your friends.... get the WELL DONE fries ANIMAL style and a Neapolitan shake and you  will not be disappointed.  the regular fries are terrible, they taste stale. so make sure you get well done.  also, prepare to wait about 10 min on a very long line to order food, and another 10 minutes to get your food.  and make you bring a friend who is really good at eyeing a free table! like a hawk. we had one of those friends and we managed to snag a table real quick."}
{"text":"Top tier among fast food places.  Food is excellent.  The service is courteous and fast.  Animal style is the way to go for both burger and fries.  Just need to get one of these to open up in the Midwest."}
{"text":"Being from Oregon, I crave In-N-Out on the daily. You really can't find fresher ingredients at a fast food joint anywhere else! Tip from a good friend that changed my life forever: get the chilis chopped in your burger ;)"}
{"text":"In-N-Out is really good for fast food, although with the wait we had it wasn't all that fast.  We talk about how we prefer Five Guys, but we always make time for a stop at In-N-Out anytime we're out west, so I guess I'm a fan.    The burgers are good, but I always find the fries a little disappointing.  Maybe I just never get fresh ones."}
{"text":"Went to Vegas for the first time and this burger was the ultimate recommendation. My wife and I had the classic burger with fries, one of the best fast food burger I've had! I will definitely recommend this spot. When I return to Vegas I will definitely revisit this spot."}
{"text":"Always busy when it's lunch or dinner time!  It's worth it for their delicious burgers.  It's always the same at In-N-Out, juicy patties, fresh veggies and full fat cheese.  I usually order the Grilled Cheese, since you get all the juicy meat flavor without the meat.  Otherwise it's a double-double animal style with No Pickles and 2 sides of spread."}
{"text":"This in and out is very good and quick always love the food at in-n-out. What I don't like is that when you call and you go right to corporate not to the individual restaurant. We had a couple burgers that weren't in the order and rather than being able to call and say something directly to the restaurant we could only get a hold of corporate which is not fair nor is it efficient."}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out.  From PHX - would go all the time. This specific location has a couple reoccurring issues.  - They do not toast the buns wells.  Multiple times the bun is luke warm - cold on a warm burger. - Fries don't seem to be hot and fresh - they seem to be warm and kinda fresh (I know they make them on the spot - but going thru the drive thru I wonder)  It's still good but not up to typical In-N-Out standards.    Shake Shack beats this all day with quality&freshness."}
{"text":"I LOVE in n out burger, but this particular location kind of lacks.  I order a double double, mustard grilled, no onions with chopped chillies.  My burger came with onions and without chopped chillies.  Also mine and my girlfriends buns were stale."}
{"text":"Joshua provided me with excellent service and even offered me water while i wait for my food wich has nevered been offered to me at a fast food restaurant. I wish i had employees like him ."}
{"text":"This specific location is awesome! I usually always get the animal style burgers and fries and this is the one location that drenches both the burger and fries with their delicious sauce. If you want a good burger, come here!"}
{"text":"They are just good - there was a line in the drive thru about 2pm on a Sunday but it went quickly and the food was correct as ordered and great tasting - just a simple good burger and fries done right!"}
{"text":"I cant recall giving out a 5 star review , but this place gets one! Not only the Vegas strip location, but other In N Out locations that I have visited. They are all consistent. best burger ever / period..... double double w raw onions , mustard only......keep it simple for me. 5 guys / no comparison shake shack / nope  it just doesn't get better. maybe because In N Out is not available in Ohio , and we only get out west every other year or so , but this place is the bomb . com!"}
{"text":"Burgers to die for, fries I could live without. Awesome awesome burger yum! There was a stupid long line but I'd wait forever in line to eat this. Which I did. And it was hot. Vegas hot. And the line indeed extended to the outdoors. Worth it."}
{"text":"Even when the lines are long, it is so worth the wait, that the time flies! Even when not dieting, I get the protein style double double. This location is my fav-close to home, not too busy, same low prices."}
{"text":"OMG why can we not have one of these in FL. All the rest of the burger Joints and no IN n out burger. I cant wait to get this little bit of heaven when i get off the plane in vegas. SO yummy. Chocolate shake all the way. GF loves her burger animal style. Yummy Cant wait to be back around for christmas time. Delicious delicious delicious."}
{"text":"This location (and all other In N Outs) absolutely nail it every time you eat there. The burgers are consistently good. The fries are consistently hot. The pink-lemonade paired up with your burger will consistently quench your thirst. I've never not been satisfied with In N Out. They offer a GREAT product."}
{"text":"Yummmmmy double double protein style! Great fries and shakes too! The staff does such a great job... They really are always nice, upbeat, and helpful. Super cheap and juicy burgers!"}
{"text":"Got a chance to check out In-N-Out for the first time on my trip to Vegas. It's totally worth the hype! Had the Double Double and Animal Style fries multiple times during my stay, and still couldn't get enough of it. Be prepared for long lines at the counter."}
{"text":"Why are you looking at reviews? You already know this shits bomb. The employees at this location are SO nice. Don't go to Tropicana they low key dicks there /:"}
{"text":"Staff is so awesome!!!! I come here 2xs a month in the drive trough and order tons of food for my staff. Service is always quick - the staff is always smiling. They don't miss a beat. Thank you guys for being awesome!!!! Love this location. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Really now, it is a Tuesday pushing 7pm this place isn't busy, and it took this location 15 minute for our order."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Shake Shack, you'll switch sides after a visit here. Treat yourself to a \"Double Double\" and chomp on a chili pepper in between bites. Life if Good!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out is a must-go whenever I'm in an area that has one!   I got a cheeseburger meal, animal style (both the burger and my fries). YUM!!!!  Always good!"}
{"text":"When you want a fresh burger, this place isn't bad. Love the traditional burger with all trimings. Fries were a bit soft and chewy and lacked a crispy taste. Lines can be long if you hit drive thru at meal times. In our heat, best to park and go in"}
{"text":"double-double animal style, animal fries and a chocolate shake!!!   enough said :-)"}
{"text":"Oh In-N-Out Burger, my old friend. I frequent the west coast every 2 years or so. And my first stop? In-N-Out. Don't blame a gal for this...it's amazing!   My order: Double-Double, Animal Style Fries Well Done, and a Chocolate Shake.   BOOM.   Super unhealthy. But was it worth it? Abso-freaking-lutely.   The workers were also ridiculously awesome here. I don't know if its just the people of Arizona in general...? But everywhere I went (at least in Scottsdale where I mostly stayed) people were really freaking nice! Go Arizona, haha! Although your baseball team needs a little work. #sorryIhadto #pleasedontkillme"}
{"text":"Eating these little puppies brings tears to my eyes. Everyone complains about how packed it is, but isn't it ALWAYS packed? If you are taking a cab, make sure to arrange a pick-up because you will be stuck loitering the streets waiting.  Other than that, BEST PLACE EVER!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years.  I've always loved In-N-Out ... the burgers are on the small end but it's perfect for me.  Great service.  Great food.  Super busy location."}
{"text":"The only reason this place get only 4 stars is because no matter where or when u go. It's a big line. I know they cook it fresh to death. And its not as bad as other fastfood places forsure. At least they try to make things fastee with the person walking outsise takin orders. But still.... The burgers are worth it. The fries are freshly cut in front of you. And you can make it anyway you want it. The only thing bad is the wait."}
{"text":"I love in n out burgers! I always stop by here since I usually pass it. The staff is usually pretty nice. Quick and friendly.   Usually it's not the cleanest but so I'd prefer the drive thru.  But the food is yummy. :)"}
{"text":"Best Burgers and home made fries I've had in a long time. Burgers made fresh and homemade fries are excellent. I can't wait to go back again"}
{"text":"In-N-Out:  if you're from the west coast and moved away- you love it because NOSTALGIA.  If you're a girl who habitually diets you like it because CHEESE & CARBS.  If you're an average Joe who eats fast food fairly regularly you probably think--what's the big deal?!  It's fine, but it's overhyped.  I think the best motive for going to In-N-Out is- \"When in Rome...\""}
{"text":"In-n-out has got to be the best fast burger joint out there.  A double double animal style is one of the greatest things you'll ever have."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers but why don't they indicate on the menu what you can get on them?I don't like guessing what kind of toppings are available.  What in the heck is fried mustard? Guy in front of me asked for it.  Anyway, solid burgers but terrible chocolate shake. The vanilla was much better. Friendly service. Place is clean."}
{"text":"Amazing experience as always! Recommend to all my friends that visit from the east coast. If you haven't tried the many locations in Las Vegas make sure you do this location is excellent!"}
{"text":"ok, now maybe I'm tainted b/c I'm from the east coast, visiting AZ and had to try In-N-Out because of the hype.  But it was really good, and the staff was sooooo nice and friendly.  I think every varsity athlete from Scottsdale was there on that (Friday) night last week.  Pretty happening scene, for a fast food place."}
{"text":"Middle of the road hamburger joint. Polite service. Slow service. Crowded. Okay milkshakes. Bland fries. Not a fan. I still stop in every once in a while because the group demands it, but every time have the same experience and the group of twelve who were huge fans have now diminished to three. I think once you have had a better quality product you see this for what it is. Cheap mid quality hamburger joint."}
{"text":"The manager, I believe is named Sarah was talking so rudely to one of her employees it almost looked like the employee was going to cry. You don't do that as a manager especially in front of others nor customers. Food was great though!"}
{"text":"Great eat. I went in for lunch and simply love this place. The staff is always super happy and the food is always perfect. Simple menu with fresh ingredients. I always get the cheeseburger protein style. I can't get enough of the fresh fries! I personally don't care for the animal style but that's merely a personal preference."}
{"text":"I just moved here from CA, so you can imagine my delight when i found one of our own here :-)  Just as good as the ones in CA with the added benefit of a shorter line!! We went at 8pm on a Friday (when it would be out the door and around the block in CA) and walked right up to order. Delicious! :-)"}
{"text":"Exceptional - Great food and the best service in the fast food industry.  Wish all fast food was this good quality - food and service.  Been going here many years, usually very good. Clean and quiet to eat inside also."}
{"text":"Best fast food burger place around! I'm a big fan of In-N-Out Burger and we're lucky to live in one of the few states that have them. Yes, it gets crowded, so if you're going to park and eat-in try parking in the lane closest to the restaurant, otherwise you'll get trapped by cars in the drive-thru line. Also, order your food and wait to get it before you grab a table. The system works that way. If you go and sit down while waiting for your food, then you've just taken a table away from someone who already has their food. Finally, at this location, if you're trying to get there from North of the 202, use Miller Road. It goes under the freeway and straight into the In-N-Out lot allowing you to skip the traffic on Rural."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is simple, cheap and AWESOME fast food!  I can't believe I've lived 29 years without this place!  There is something magical about the fries.  They're simple, not greasy (for french fries) and unlike any other fry I've ever tasted.  They've got a really unique texture...I can't explain it.  I love mine with that horribly good slice of cheese on top of them.  The double double is just perfect as well.  I'm not a big fan of fast food hamburgers, but I could eat these burgers several times a week!  The special sauce is like a thousand island dressing (think Big Mac), but it's not as tangy as the typical thousand island topping.  The 2 patties are thin, but not too thin.   Even though this location is super busy, the employees are always super nice and very patient with newbies."}
{"text":"Had to stop in here on a recent trip to Vegas. Gotta get my In-N-Out fix!   This particular In-N-Out had a line out the door when we went (Saturday afternoon).  It's proximity to the strip likely makes it a hot tourist destination.   The one unique thing about this In-N-Out is the company store located right next door to the restaurant. Here you'll find everything In-N-Out related that you could possibly want, including toddler and kids clothes. I picked up a little button down for my son."}
{"text":"Us kids out here in boring old Colorado feel like the outcasts...we're cool enough for In-N-Out, I promise!   My husband and I made a point of checking out I-N-Out on our recent trip to Vegas. We studied what we could find of the secret menu online and knew what we would get. My husband had his heart set on lots of cheese and I was excited to try the Neapolitan shake. So my husband got a 2x4, cheese fries and a drink and I ordered a double with fries and the shake. The total was way less than comparable items would be at McDonalds, by at least $8. Everything was great...greasy, but great! My husband said he was confused and thought he would get 4 slices of cheese total, not on each patty. He ended up not finishing the burger, but only because he couldn't eat any more cheese. We both agreed that we would choose In-N-Out over other fast food restaurants any day if we had one in Colorado. If you live near an In-N-Out I consider you a lucky person."}
{"text":"Always a treat when we are in town. Typically I get to eat whatever my heart's content when I visit. This time I was on a strict diet of no gluten, eggs, or dairy. Turns out that In-N-Out has an 'Allergy Burger' that leaves off the sauce, cheese, and replaces the bun with lettuce patties. Also, their fries are gluten free so I could eat those as well. So even though I couldn't get my usual #2 Animal Style meal their diet-accommodating meal was good as well given the circumstances."}
{"text":"I love their burgers! It's my favorite place to go after a long day of work. The spread is amazing over the fries because sometimes they can be plain. The burgers are nice and juicy. The meals are cheaper the most fast food places and you get more for your money. I have been satisfied with my service they took my order quickly and kept the line moving."}
{"text":"Cheap but not fast because they are always so busy.  The burger is pretty good here but not amazing like Goldie's in Tulsa OK or at It's a Better Burger in Maryland Heights Missouri.  Fries are really good but eat them fast because they get cold on a hurry.  The workers here are always nice but they are overworked because it seems tables are always in need of being wiped down.  All in all it's a must hit if you are in Vegas or Cali."}
{"text":"5 stars for a fast food burger joint? Yep!  I've been a big fan of this chain for years and was thrilled Vegas had them when I moved here from Cali. Was never lucky enough to have one anywhere near where I lived so this is extra exciting because it's a 5 min drive from my house now! It's so pretty and new now and I hope that lasts for a long time.   The menu is simple and and I love their cheeseburger with grilled onions and ketchup & mustard instead of the house sauce. Fries are good but eat them quickly because they don't taste great after they've cooled. Also love their strawberry shake!   You can customize to your liking and everyone is nice about it. Sometimes they're so nice (especially the drive thru girls) that it forces me to perk up after a shitty day. Hands down one of the best fast food chains out there!"}
{"text":"Out of all the in n outs... this is by far the slowest of them all.  Expect to wait in the drive thru 30-40 min."}
{"text":"The burger  was amazing and juicy. I had the cheeseburger and you could taste the fresh  onions and tomatoes. The bun was slightly  crispy and soft. The fries were very fresh and delicious. They were lightly peppered and had a raw texture. The chocolate  shake  was too thick and needed a spoon"}
{"text":"Cheeseburger, fries and shake. What else can I say. The best in the world. Perfect lunch after the perfect beer."}
{"text":"Worst experience at In-N-Out burger, the patty was so thin I could barely taste it and I was overcooked!! I won't return to this one, I will be sure to go to the one by the strip to be safe next time I get the urge"}
{"text":"I am not one of the big fans of In and Out that others are. I think it is a decent burger for a very good price. As a result, I go there somewhat frequently. So why 5 stars? Because every time I go this store I am surprised at how friendly the employees are. Not a few of them...all of them. They are always so courteous and patient. While waiting for my food last week I was watching some lady make a ridiculous order or ridiculous specifications for each and every hamburger she wanted. It took a really long time as she kept changing what she wanted. But that person on the register...she just kept smiling. So, five stars to this store for a decent burger, and exceptional employees."}
{"text":"PROS:  Food is always freshly made to order!   Food tastes great!  Food is hot!  Fries are never cold! (and if by some weird chance they are... Notify them and they will promptly replace them with fresh ones!)  Food is inexpensive!  Lemonade is delicious!  Even without a breakfast menu... Their Kona Coffee is DELICIOUS! (And I'm a coffee critic)  People are always friendly and attentive. They serve you with a smile!   CONS: Drive-Thru ALWAYS has a long line (because, YES, the food is that good but [PRO:] it DOES move quickly!)  It is often hard to find a seat (because, YES, the food is that good).  It is nearly impossible to get one of the 3 tables with HANDICAP access during rush hour times (lunch & dinner). They definitely need to add more or change ALL of their seating to handicap accessible.  IN CONCLUSION: I have them 5 STARS because... THE FOOD REALLY IS THAT GOOD, ESPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE!"}
{"text":"I've been living in Las Vegas for twenty years and in n out used to be really good. The last four times I ate my usual double double it was dry and tasteless. I'm done with this place! I wouldn't recommend in n out to anyone."}
{"text":"Hit this spot after a concert at Mesa Amp and it did the trick for the late night craving. Jammin brugers, quality service and a great milk shake!!   Thanks crew y'all killed it!"}
{"text":"This was yet another INO location for us to try  :) . This location is your typical INO which has indoor and outdoor seating. There is also one drive thru window. As this location is very close to the Vegas Strip, it is pretty busy, even shortly after opening time. So there was a bit of a wait to get our order.  Staff were friendly and, once again, our burger orders were perfectly executed and delicious!!   tip - there is an INO merchandise store located next door, so check it out. It's only one of 2 stores that exist in the entire nation!"}
{"text":"Ok, I just had freakishly good service there this week. Even their fries are better than I remember them. In fact, everything was good. We walked in & there was a line to the door. I had a sense of dread, as I sometimes have the patience of a 3-year-old when I am hungry.   The line moved swiftly & efficiently. My brother grabbed us a table while I was finishing up my order. His order came out, but mine was still being made. A lady working there came up and asked if I was waiting for an order. I said I was, & she offered to get it for me. Then she brought it to my table when it was ready. I was like, \"what is happening here?\" to my brother. The great service was weirding me out a bit. Then as I was finishing, she came up to the table & offered to take it away for me! My brother had already cleaned his stuff up. I was convinced they thought I was a secret shopper or something. Granted I've been living in a country with horrible service for the last 4 years, so I think I'm just experiencing a bit of culture shock.  In-N-Out Burger, you represent what is awesome about America. Thank you for freaking me out with your amazing service.   P.S. Please start serving booze."}
{"text":"First time and first impressions. No frills, but just fresh and good.  If you want something simple, fast and tasty, this place could fit the bill for you."}
{"text":"This is just my opinion, but they have some of the best burgers ever! I'm from Los Angeles, so I was very happy to hear that we had an In-N-Out in avondale! It's not for everyone though. The burgers here do taste different, and so do the fries. I feel that it's because the fries are never frozen and are made on the spot. ( Some people are used to the fake greasy McD fries ) I think I saw something about the burger never being frozen too? I could be wrong though.   TASTE GREAT! You should at least try it."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say about In-N-Out that hasn't been said before. Fresh burgers, great taste, awesome service. Fries are awesome, shakes are awesome. I mostly get my stuff protein style, and their lettuce always holds my burger excellently. Their spread is delicious.  Just hands down the best fast food chain in the US."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great prices! Quick service. You can't beat the freshness and quality of the food for the price! Beats any fast food chain by far! I always get myself a double double animal style with fries and a chocolate shake. All that food for around $7...can't beat it with a 9 foot stick! My kids won't eat McDonald's food but always eat the burgers from here! Kids know best! They also give the kids stickers and hats if you ask.  One of my favorite fast food restaurants hands down!"}
{"text":"Yup. Just as good as it is in CA. Went on fri 2pm and it was empty. Got our food faster than I've ever gotten it at an In N Out. Quick access off the freeway.  If travelling in from California, this is the first one on the Arizona side you'll encounter on I-10."}
{"text":"Ahhh a tasty In N Out Burger while in Vegas. A nice treat before the plane ride home. As you can imagine, its pretty crowded. Parking was easier on the company store side. Excellent burger and fries just like every other In N Out I have been to."}
{"text":"Love eating In-N-Out Burger. We always go to the one off the strip, so I was glad they finally opened this one. As always, they were extremely busy and extremely fast. The food was fresh as always and the most delicious. Anytime I am on the west coast I make it a point to find a In-N-Out."}
{"text":"WOOOT WOOOOTTTTTTTTT!!!!! This is the first time I can easily say that this is 5 stars and far exceeded my expectations. I 've heard about this place from several others that live on the west coast and HAD to try it. It was by far the most AMAZING burger I have ever had (and I have tried many GREAT burger places). It was the best meal (and cheapest) that I came across in VEGAS and I even ate at Bobby Flay's. Burger tasted fresh, the cheese was THICK and tasty...Lettuce was so CRISP like they just picked it. It was just ONE of a KIND! Added bonus that the people are EXTRA friendly and if you like cheese fries.....they take a thick slice of cheddar cheese place it on top and put it in this melter for a min....YUM. I'd drive from CHicago to get one RIGHT now!!!!! SO if youre in VEGAS its only a 5 dollar cab ride from MGM hotel. WELL worth it. Even with the cost of a cab ride it was the cheapest meal and BEST meal I had in Vegas."}
{"text":"It's not fair to brand In and Out burger with the \"chain\" tag because the burgers are just so bloody beautiful.  The meat is fresh, I believe the rule is that it can never be frozen and so they only source their burgers from a farm close enough to each restaurant so that it doesn't have to be frozen.  Most people will get the animal style and be adventurous however I am a real plain Jane and stick to double meat and double cheese in a lovely slightly toasted bun, perfection!  One of the most painful things about moving back home to England is not being able to have In and Out burgers as a staple part of my diet. I miss you meat heaven!"}
{"text":"Tonight, along with studying for finals and finishing a few projects my boyfriend & I had a hunger for our favorite fast food, so we headed to in n out. I wasn't expecting much, especially because it was pretty late, around 12:30am when we pulled up, and I know you guys close at 1am. I was expecting average service and a great meal- but instead I had the most amazing service I've ever been provided, via alyssa tonight, monday 12/4/17. She was astounding, answering all of our questions and offering any way to keep us happy and contented under her service, I hope you guys appreciate her, as she could easily work in any restaurant as a server."}
{"text":"Best burgers anywhere!  I moved to Oregon a month ago and I can only pray that In-N-Out comes to Oregon soon!!"}
{"text":"Love the food and Love the service!  I will admit that I wasn't too big of a fan of In-N-Out because of the french fries. They were always kind of soggy and lacked flavor but then I found out you can order them well done!  Hip Hip Hooray! Just the way I like them ~ Crispy and fresh!  It's kinda fun just to watch them press cut the potatoes for their french fries.  Added bonus is to order them 'Animal Style'.  Yum O Yum! Grilled onions, cheese and their special sauce really tops an already great well done french fry.  I'd highly recommend it.  Burgers are always good here which you can also order 'Animal style'.  Yay!  Service here is fantastic.   They are so friendly.  It was also nice to see someone always cleaning the tables in the dining area ~  even clearing some of the trash if you'd finished but still sitting there.    I feel it's much better than many of the other fast food hamburger places.  You'll be In- N -Out but I bet you'll be back In before you know it!"}
{"text":"Yum yum gimme some!! This place is always busy... and that's cause it's delicious!! Staff is sweet and friendly and burgers never disappoint."}
{"text":"First time at an In and Out Burger.  We don't have them on the east coast. Held up to the hype, got the Double Double combo.  Lots of busy employees bustling around but still had to wait on the food. This location was rocking inside and drive thru. Good stuff."}
{"text":"I was at your location on dean Martin about 1 am I ordered a double double with cheese combo and a cheeseburger. When I got To the pick up window the employee at the window checked the bag read our order correctly back to us and asked if we wanted ketchup spread or anything else I asked for ketchup spread n peppers he placed them all in the bag and gave us the bag. When we got home which we live far from this in n out to be exact in summerlin north. The bag only had three trays of fries no burger. We went specifically to this in n out because it's the only one open around this time and I told my husband I was craving in n out."}
{"text":"Great burger! It's incredibly busy but the wait isn't too long. You will have to wait if you want to dine in otherwise very enjoyable. My first time on the west coast and I loved the burger. I'll return when I make my next trip here.  I probably take the burger and fries to go next time."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a little of the old IN N' Out. Since that wasn't happenin I went to this place for some west coast burgers.  HOLY CRAP  my friends. We are getting screwd by our east coast fast food purveyors.  This is a real burger. It was delicious and piled high with onion, lettuce, tomato, sauce. and drum roll puleeeez:  The people who worked there a.) provided excellent customer service b.) got the order right.(wow) and 3.) spoke ENGLISH. This was like a throwback to the fifties. I loved it. ps. I saw Elvis there."}
{"text":"What is ever bad about In N Out? Typical spot, same decor as any other. Quick, friendly service with delicious burgers and frys. Milkshakes are outstanding and you have to get extra spread for the fries (it's free just ask). Parking gets a little crazy and the bathrooms are always to small, but I can easily overlook that once I get my food."}
{"text":"Fresh burgers, friendly courteous staff, fast service, animal style all day erryday. No matter which location you go to, you can count on In-N-Out for friendly staff and fresh ingredients, neat burgers, never sloppy. Fave fast food chain, always my go-to in AZ/CA - really wish it was out east!"}
{"text":"Exactly as expected from an In-N-Out!  Fresh and friendly faces and always busy!  Gotta get your food animal style (kinda like Mac sauce). Neapolitan shakes are the bomb!"}
{"text":"I'm from MN and was visiting my parents over Christmas who spend winters here. One of my Christmas wishes was to make a stop at In-N-Out.  I was so impressed with the staff and cleanliness of this location. I love to see a group of hard working, polite young people - just awesome! They even gave us a signed Christmas card from the whole staff which was very thoughtful. We had really yummy burgers and fries (a hamburger for me fully loaded with onions and double singles lettuce wraps for mom & dad). I'll definitely be back and might try for one more trip before I head home."}
{"text":"Om nom-nom-nom-nom... In-N-Out Burger is so freaking good! If you go to Vegas and you live somewhere where there isn't an In-N-Out Burger YOU MUST GO!!!"}
{"text":"Quick service at the register, food was great. I went to order two chocolate shakes after we are and it took 12 minutes :/ only downside."}
{"text":"I'm from Southern California and it was nice to go to this location.. No crowd and the 2 guys I talked to were very nice and polite.. I was In and Out in no time at all"}
{"text":"BUSY BUSY BUSY! Did I say that they were busy yet? Lines wrapped through the restraunt and out the front door. Even at that the food was ready quickly and the quality was great as expected from In-N-Out. Something had to be wrong with the Soda machine because every one we tried was flat. maybe a 10 minute walk from Excalibur."}
{"text":"All I can say is I LOVE In & Out Burger!!!  Way better than McDonalds, Burger King, and Jack in the box. I love the fact they are inexpensive as well. I always get a double cheeseburger with fries combo. You can never go wrong with this burger joint.   Only downfall about this particular in & out is the drive through lines can be VERY long (to the point were cars are lined up almost half way into the street)  If you go inside it gets packed as well (but the workers are really fast) and of course its in the Tempe area by ASU. So of course it will be beyond packed during the week and especially the weekends.   I still make my journey from south phoenix to get my favorite burger, keep it up guys :)"}
{"text":"How can you really go wrong with In-N-Out?! Despite the fact that they're a chain, food is always consistent and very reasonably priced. I also love that their menu hasn't changed since they opened. My order has not changed since I've been a kid, #2 with cheeseburger made animal style. In-N-Out will always win the burger debate in my heart!"}
{"text":"Dont be afraid Not to animalize your burger or fries they are still delish! Yes the \"secret menu\" is fun but eat what makes you happy!"}
{"text":"Never been here during the day, maybe that's when the employees who actually care are working. I usually come at night and have never had good service. By that, I mean that every time I come here it's NOT busy but still takes forever to get my food There are generally only 1-2 cars in front of us at a time, so you would expect maybe a 5 minute wait? The past few times I've went, was 20 minutes of waiting. Don't know about you, but that's a long time to be waiting on a burger! By the time I get to the window, and this has happened every time, the people at the window don't really seem to give a shit whether I waited forever or not. No \"hey sorry about the wait\" or even a \"hi how's it going\". Even an attempt at guest recovery would be noble, but no.   The Lake Mead location is faster than this place and they usually have at least 10 cars wrapped around the building."}
{"text":"Pros: Best burger I've ever had. Potatoes peeled and machine cut right on premises...Best Fries I've ever had. Google their secret menu and then order your burger \"animal style\" etc.  Cons: Long lines....plus they don't have any locations in Boston :("}
{"text":"Why is it that everyone that works here is so friggin' nice? Oh yeah, the burgers are awesome."}
{"text":"Great service could maybe get a faster drive threw. Also could knock down the mac Donald's across the street and make another in n out. Other than that 5 stars"}
{"text":"It's In-N-Out, fast fresh burger and great service. We come to this location to avoid the mobs across from the strip. Sorry Shake Shack In-N-Out is the winner of this head to head."}
{"text":"Rock solid burger, great service and as usual clean facility. Thank you!"}
{"text":"How do you review In-N-Out Burger? I've been eating at this chain since the mid - 80s when I was stationed in California. Fresh cut fries, only two types of burgers... unless you know the \"secret\" menu. If you don't know what the secret menu is, please google it. It will enhance your In-n-out experience to the next level and beyond. This review may be for the one location, but I have never had a bad experience at any of their restaurants.   Try one. And make it Animal style!"}
{"text":"Not much different than their other locations except this one isn't as busy which is great.  Nice outdoor seating area with a great northern view of the valley.  Wish their burgers where a bit larger in size."}
{"text":"the food is always good as well as their service. It can be hard to get a seat inside sometimes otherwise I would have rated it 5 starts. I have had better shakes but the burgers are very good"}
{"text":"In-N-Out Burger is located fairly close to the Las Vegas Strip. To get there you would want to to to the New York New York resort and walk down the street. It is best to be on the Ex Caliber resort side as there are no crosswalks or sidewalks on the New York side. It is about a 15 min walk each way (From the NY NY property). You do have to walk under a bridge on a walking path that is a little shady (homeless living there- but still felt safe). Once there you walk to the first stop light with a crosswalk to cross the street and you are at In-N-Out. Food is the typical great quality- served fresh and full of flavor. This was a nice experience to get In-N-Out again. The staff here is very organized and knows how to handle crowds."}
{"text":"Honestly what can I say about in n out that hasn't been said before? People keep telling me things like... \"you know I think I like five guys better\". Five guys is great, but it's burgers are soggy and fall apart if you take them out of the foil wrapper. In n out has stood the test of time, when I lived out east during college I used to crave these burgers, and the first thing I wanted off the plane was always in n out. That is true burger love my friends."}
{"text":"Well, I think the burgers are okay. The staff was super nice and clean. So, I would definitely go back.   However, I do think they need more meat on the burger. The taste was good but it was like I was being tricked and teased. If I wanted more I would have to order another burger. I was not crazy about the fries after they got cold from the AC. I certainly wasn't planning to ask to use their microwave. LOL  I think this place is worth a try. But, this will not go in my top 5 of burger places, sorry.   ~Cheers"}
{"text":"Honestly came to see what all the west coast hype was about lol  In-N-Out is your typical fast food burger joint. Prices are ridiculously cheap though. I had the cheeseburger meal and an order of fries. I wasn't really a fan of the bun. It tasted like the default-store brand buns you buy for a cookout at home. Ya know what I mean? White bread, falls apart, softish?   Also, the fries are not salted (at least mine weren't) and I mean, I don't know.. they're nothing really to write home about. I will say, this is not a negative a review about this establishment at all. I did enjoy my meal, it served its purpose in satisfying my craving for a burger after a night of drinking haha  I think In-N-Out is okay-- just definitely not the burger mecca that everyone hypes it up to be."}
{"text":"Due to being a Vegetarian, the pure thought of In-N-Out used to make me feel a little unsettled and queasy. I mean that's a LOT of meat being pumped out of one chain. I digress. Anyhow, I got dragged there and boy oh boy am I glad I gave it a chance! I had a grilled cheese that has now become my Valley favorite. It's delicious! Has lettuce, tomato, house dressing and perfectly melted cheese. They even cook it in on a \"meat free\" surface... (I watched). The fries are also tasty as can be. I used to think they were too floppy and soggy, but they have crispied them up a bit.  There is always a massive line of cars at this location, so be prepared to wait a little while. The people work incredibly fast, though, so it always amazes me how fast the line moves. They have a smile and are friendly. Keep an eye out for tips or search their website for non-listed menu items and styles."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!I love this food,it's cheap and tastes good this is my first stop in Vegas!The food is really good.I wish they had some in Colorado.This is like heaven.I really recommend this if you haven't tried it."}
{"text":"Today was our first visit and we were not disappointed. The simplified menu is a welcomed feature, 3 hamburger options, fries, shakes, and soft drinks. Makes ordering simple, and it surely streamlines the preparation.  The hamburgers were great; prepared with lettuce, tomatoe, and onion. The Thousand Island sauce was a nice addition. Fries were nice and crispy. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"This specific location irks my brain. I feel like 15 of my little brothers are running this spot. It's embarrassing to watch. I get the idea of hiring young kids for fast food...I TOTALLY DO. But they're young, some with no experience ever. It would be nice to see an actual adult being involved & correcting the countless amount of mistakes going on in this place. Sometimes the drive thru line is faster than the inside. Sometimes the inside is faster than the drive thru. I'm just confused on how this place is ran & who it's being ran by. Every time I go in to grab my food I literally feel like I'm NOT @ an In N Out establishment. So strange."}
{"text":"you really can't go wrong for a fast food burger here!! always get the double-double and never been dissapointed. nothing else just burgers...no shakes...no fries...nothing but the burger... this is where i go when i don't want to spend $13-21 for a gourmet burger. best \"first tier\" burger...\"second tier\" 5 guys...after that its ted's homemade...really an $18++ burger...ok i'll try one...eventually."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and this place gets packed but well worth the wait. Make sure to get animal style cheese burger and animal style fries. And I washed it all down with a strawberry shake. If you're gonna eat unhealthy, you might as well go all the way in my book. Afterward, I walked back to the strip (30 minutes) to walk off my fullness. Why not 5 stars? I prefer a medium to thick patty. In n Out looks like a skinny McDonald patty. I like a decent chunk of meat and see the juice spew out just a little. A burger is not a burger if its not at least bit greasy.   But I admit these are the best fries I ever had. Not greasy but crisp and no salt needed. You can actually see them make the fries fresh from the potato.   I asked for In n Out sauce packets, so I'm gonna experiment on my own burgers/sandwiches at home :)"}
{"text":"Being from the east coast In-N-Out Burger is like a delicacy. We do not have it here so whenever I make my way to the west coast, In-N-Out is on my list of places to go. Unfortunately, I have only been once in California but never all the times I have been to Vegas. On my last trip to Vegas I made sure that this was on the list of places to eat. Silly enough, I googled \"How to walk to In-N-Out from the Vegas strip\" and low and behold a blog came up with step by step directions, along with pictures, on how to walk from The Excalibur (the hotel I was staying at) right to In-N-Out. It was a short 15 min walk, I could see the sign from the strip! We arrive at the restaurant and the smell of burgers is like a drug and I basically run inside. The restaurant is packed with a decent size line. Fear not, they are a well oiled machine and not even 10 minutes later I am sitting down eating my delicious cheeseburger (animal style) fries and a coke. The burger is perfect. The patty is the perfect size, the toppings are all fresh and the fries are good as well. If you are from the east coast and are in Las Vegas and are staying at The Excalibur, MGM, Tropicana, NY NY, Luxor or Mandalay Bay, this location is super easy to walk to. If anywhere else on the strip, fear not, I saw many cabs dropping people off here. In-N-Out is a must when on the west coast and it must make it's way to the east coast, it just has to!"}
{"text":"No matter which location you end up at, you can always expect good service and consistently good food :)  No mater how complicated I make my order, they always repeat it back to make sure it was taken correctly.   And yes, people do make mistakes, but for the occasional time it does happen, they are quick to fix my order.  If you love the spread, you can ask for some packets for your fries!   I love ordering my fries without salt so they a fresh batch for you (you're welcome)  And if you love crispy fries, try ordering them well done.   I love INO, if you know someone visiting or who has yet to try it, be that good change in their lives"}
{"text":"Mm love In-N-Out. A must stop for our trip to the west coast. Get your burgers animal style, it's the best way. I like the fries just as it is. They are fresh and not overly salted. Burgers have always been fresh to order.   This location is not far from the airport/The Strip which makes it that much more convenient for a quick trip. Plenty of parking and tables. The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"It's a good place for a burger but I do feel their are better places. Don't get me wrong, I like the food but it's not in my top 5. The burgers are good but the fries are always like warm. The place is always spotless which is important to me. It says they care about quality but could use better fries. I'm from Texas and WHATABURGER is really better"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a double-double and animal fries.  Good quick tasty burger for a reasonable price.  This specific location was clean, with polite staff and in what seemed to be a relatively central location in Scottsdale.  First class."}
{"text":"This is just the best burger chain. Nothing compares. This location is clean and the employees nice and friendly. It can probably be crowded when UNLV is in session. Come often and come happy."}
{"text":"Finally got to try In-N-Out Burger!  I've seen people post pictures of their burgers and \"Animal Style\" fries, I just had to try it for myself.  My friend and I came here around 5:00pm.  The lines weren't too long and go by quickly, the place was packed with people waiting for their food and seats and tables were filled.  I ordered the Cheeseburger Combo (protein style), which came with fries and a medium drink.  I ordered my fries \"Animal Style,\" which is fries topped with melted cheese, sautéed chopped onions and Thousand Island Dressing.  The burger was delicious; the protein/bunless version makes it feel light and the Thousand Island Dressing adds some sweetness but complements the burger really well.  The \"Animal Style\" fries was just okay for me.  I would order the fries as is.  It's quite messy, so my friend and I asked for utensils.  Customer service was friendly and quick, despite the busyness.  I'll come back here if I'm ever craving for a burger. I have yet to try their milkshakes!  Some tips and notes:  - They do protein/bunless burgers; it's not on the menu, you just have to ask - \"Animal Style\" fries is on their secret menu, as my friend has told me; mention it to the cashier and they'll know what you're talking about - They do not have utensils in the back with the condiments and napkins; you will need to ask - Eating the \"Animal Style\" fries can be messy, make sure to ask for utensils!"}
{"text":"you'd think this place should be open 24/7!!! NV should be thankful that CA was willing to share this delicacy with them! :)  No matter what state I visit, I always crave this when I get back home. Of course, no matter what in n out you go to its going 2 have long lines. Its totally worth the wait! My gfs and my first meal b4 we leave NV after a \"whatever happends in Vegas stays in Vegas\" type of trip.  2 cheeseburgers with grilled onions, 1 hambuger with grilled onions and one without lettuce but with grilled onions! and a couple sides of spread 4 our fries! The animal style fries r super yummy also!  Can't ever go wrong with in n out! I'm proud 2 b a californian. Thanks in n out 4 being dear 2 my heart!  u NEVER seem 2 fail me."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years.  Took my wife, she's NEVER been here.  Same great burgers!!  Would give 5 stars but the fries aren't my favorite.  Service kicks ass though!!!!  Good to be back!"}
{"text":"Your typical In-N-Out. I live in the Midwest so whenever I come to the West Coast I try to get my fix in. I saw last October when I was in Vegas that they were opening one on the Strip, in the Linq/High Roller area, so I was very excited about that.  I was looking for more of a snack today, so the only thing I got was a hamburger, animal style. I love that they marinate it in extra sauce when you ask for that and they also add chopped onions on top. The hamburger was delicious and I wish we had this chain closer to me.  This location does lose one star for me because it didn't have any bathrooms, as far as I could tell. I had to backtrack to the Linq and find a bathroom to use after my meal, instead. Also, they need more seating, I was lucky to get a booth but a lot of people were eating outside due to the lack of seating inside.  That being said, In-N-Out is delicious and my burger was very good."}
{"text":"Newly opened In & Out on the strip!  Small joint but the customer service was outstanding.  Came in three times in four days and each time the food came out quick, hott & the staff was pleasant and quick to wipe down tables for other patrons to sit.  I have been to a few different locations in various states & this location was my favorite!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out doesn't need much more praise than they probably already received, but here's my two cents about it:  They make your burgers just the way you want it. But they even do it for your fries. You want them animal style? No salt? You got it. How many fast food burger places do that for you with no complaints?   Their patties and potatoes are never frozen. And they're delicious.   And they're cheaper than most burger stops. Can't ask for more than that..."}
{"text":"We landed, grabbed our luggage, picked up our rental car, checked in our hotel quickly and headed straight to In N Out.  That's how much we love this place.  When In N Out makes the list of \"things I gotta do in Vegas list\"..you know it's worth trying.  The line for drive thru wrapped around the store and so we opted to dine in.  Even though it looks like a madhouse inside, surprisingly...service is quick, your order is up before you know it, and it's not that hard to snag a table inside or outside.    I really need to cut this review short since my stomach is starting to growl at the thought of a burger and their fries. All I know is that In N Out is a must visit for me every time I'm near one."}
{"text":"Never seen so many kids work so hard at a fast food restaurant. This place was crazy and they are getting them in and out. Great job manager"}
{"text":"So, what is it about In-N-Out Burger lettuce? I don't even like iceberg lettuce. In-N-Out iceberg actually has a delicious flavor. Is it organic? Is it a new variety? WTG In-N-Out! Thanks for being so selective."}
{"text":"Burgers are fresh and delicious, cheese is melted and gooey. Meat tastes great and not dry at all. Buns are fresh and soft but don't fall apart from the juicy burgers or condiments. Was disappointed with the fries, the texture was completely off. They were not crispy but yet the potato inside was brittle. Maybe that batch was cooked at too high a temperature and taken out before they could get crispy or burn. I'm from Texas so I'll be happy with Whataburger when I go home but try this too while you're in town."}
{"text":"It all started on a Wednesday night. I was having a night. Not a good night. Just a night. So what should I do? Pick up a buddy and drive through the local In-N-Out. We were sitting there jamming to the home boy Chris Cornell Spoon Man and then right after that the theme song to Little Einsteins. So climb aboard and get ready to explore the awesome service these two homies had. We pull up to the window to be blessed by Corey the Cashier. (That's his new nickname). He asks about our night at which point I'm telling him I'm having a night. We've already covered that. He reminds us that our night is about to get better because we have delicious burgers coming our way. We cheer. We laugh. We have a grand ole time talking about the heaven sent classics that you find at this eating establishment. We say our goodbyes, shed a tear, and pull forward to be met with destiny. And by Destiny I mean the nice lady who gave us our food. They accidentally handed us the carside boxes when they said they would bag it up, BUT THATS OKAY. That just means we had to consume it sooner than expected. She asked if we wanted ketchup, yes please give me all of that red gold sent from Zeus himself to grace my tongue with those lightly salted golden potato spears creating the perfect combination of sauce to fry. All in all. 10 out of 10 would do again."}
{"text":"Very good food. Their double double is amazing. Usually crowded as any other In&out. Very good prices for the quality of the food. Friendly and helpful staff.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a burger! I love their animal fries. The only thing is that their food is do heavy you often feel sick after eating there. You have to have a big appetite."}
{"text":"Omg omg omg!  I live 2000 miles away from the closest In and Out Burger. What a treat it is when I get to indulge at this place. They were super friendly here and got my food right away.  I didn't have to ask for anything they packaged up my food to go with condiments and proper utensils.  This place gets the importance of good customer service. Plus the food is just so damn good!"}
{"text":"Well can't go wrong with the ole American  classic!  Ask for no salt on fries or beef patty if interested.  Nice spicy peppers on the side. It can get busy so be patient"}
{"text":"As far as In-N-Outs go, this one was just A-OK.  We were so excited to have in n out burgers animal style and took a cab specially just to get here. But this is definitely not the most orgasmic.  They were totally lacking on the animal style sauce in the burger so it was a bit dry."}
{"text":"Mediocre burger at best and the worst fries. Don't fall for the hype. Smashburger and Five Guys crush this place."}
{"text":"Fresh and solid..   Been to other In and Out locations about 10-15 times..   This location is on par with the others.. friendly customer service and they don't hesitate to explain the off menu options..   For example i wanted 4 patties with cheese on one burger so i tried to order it as \"two double doubles on one burger\" thankfully the cashier simplified it for me as a 4x4.. this makes it easier for me as next time i go in i will be ordering a 5x5 or possibly a 6x6.. cause really the only times i go here are when i'm not thinking rationally..  Also i get everything here animal style as the fries by themselves are probably the most boring or worst fast food fries ever."}
{"text":"I love the service for the type of joint it is, and I'll give them credit for keeping it simple and being great at what they do in the process. The sauce, the cheese, the patties, the buns...YUM! They need to teach McDonald's how to make burgers and the definition of special sauce. No pictures, I am not ashamed to say I ate 2 double doubles...LOL! Please open up a spot in Charlotte, NC!"}
{"text":"First time experience of the West Coast burger place. The burger wasn't bad at all. The plain fries I could of done without. Was a overall good experience and great price as well."}
{"text":"I'll never get tired of INO!!  Ordered with Drive thru and Sanja was in top of it.i know my order can be a mouthful to say, but she got it perfectly without asking me to repeat myself.  Just like the name, you can always expect to be in n out of this place (minus the lunch rush) and that's exactly what happened.  Only reason why this wasn't a 5/5: - Fries were soggy.  I always ask for fries no salt so they make it fresh, but this was a bit disappointing....  - no chopped chilies  Asked for them and Sanja punched it in correctly but literally didn't find any chillies till the LAST BITE.  C' mon, that's just trying to ruin someone's day :(  Regardless, I'll give location another shot. Since it is closest to where I live. Till next time!"}
{"text":"They are amazing as everyone raves about it. We got the animal burgers and animal fries. Both were good."}
{"text":"First time coming to one of these and when I walked in and saw the line up I thought it would be a long wait.  Well happy to say they live up to their name.  With a limited menu they are fast in getting your order and getting you on your way. I had the double combo.  The burger was awesome but the fries were meh.  Both me and my buddy didn't end up finishing our fries.  Otherwise the burger hit the spot and was a great deal for under $9."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly. Drive-thru was 10 cars deep, but I had my order in the passenger seat within 10 minutes of placing the order. Convenient location off the highway and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Best possible meal when you are craving for carbs ... This location is clean and not very crowded."}
{"text":"REALLY GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICR!!!! after a long trip me and my wife were Hungry as a Lion. we are glad we dicided to eat at the In &Out restaurant. Really frenly service and fast.   The bathrooms were clean and had all in order.  If any of you dicide to Come To Las Vegas dont forget to stop by for a double double and some animal style fries......"}
{"text":"Location/Service - Along the Las Vegas Strip, there's a big sign pointing towards it - so not hard to miss - Restaurant is relatively big, but it is super packed since it's in the heart of the city - Line ups go out the door, but they have a pretty good logistic system that makes it go pretty quick - Staff are nice and friendly when taking orders. Also, they don't panic, remain calm despite being it very busy and heavy with traffic  Food - Ordered a regular hamburger and french fries (classic item) as it was my first time - Overall, it's a pretty plain, simple burger - Patty was done well, a little dry, but it didn't give me any 'wow' factor at all - Cheese and lettuce compliment well - Burger size standard size (around a hand palm) - Fries are pretty regular as well, not much with a 'wow' factor as well  I'm not entirely sure what's the overall hype is for In-n-Out. Price value wise it's very cheap (~$6). I guess for a quick snack or late night food, it might be quite comforting. But I would prefer Shake Shack more than this."}
{"text":"Okay, so hands down. Best In N Out.  The service was so friendly, restaurant was clean, burger and cheese fries were delicious, and I will define you come back here and totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"So this was my first time trying In n Out. And, I'll have to admit, there was quite a lot of hype from a ton of friends over the years. But, after finally trying it, I now know what's up. Everything was cheap, fresh and tasty--just like everyone was saying. The line can be pretty long at this location, but it moved relatively quickly. Must have it again the next time I'm on the west coast. Looking forward to my next Animal Style!"}
{"text":"Probably the best burger joint in the USA. And if you select the regular hamburger, it's one of the lowest fat fast food burgers you can get.  Regardless of time of day it typically takes 9 minutes to get your meal ready.   Personally I think their fries are poor, so I don't buy them anymore.  Always clean, ample parking, difficult to get in and out of Desert Ridge Mall.  And for the record, I quit going to McDonalds in the 1970's and quit Burger King and Arby's in the 90's.  UPDATE: I re-checked the claimed fat content of a typical 1/4lb burger without cheese and standard toppings, and I&O is still the lowest. If memory serves, next best was Wendy's and then the Whopper. I don't eat at McDonald's no matter what."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times but the last time I went was about 11pm on a Friday night. The place was packed with oddly dressed people, looked like they came from a wedding reception.  As a gift I ordered 20 burgers for the Mountain Vista ER since they treated me so well, I went back a week later to show my appreciation and fed the staff.  I placed my order just before the wedding reception crowd arrived.   20 single patty burgers, no cheese, nothing else (they have drinks etc at the hospital). Good enough, paid in cash and then the manager who was working the burger assembly line sees the order on his screen and walks over to argue with me over ordering fries after I already had that discussion with the girl at the register.  No I don't want anything more than what I clearly ordered already (besides that your fries suck anyway). All he was trying to do was deal with his 'numbers' for that shift, not selling enough add-ons per burger. And due to his business interests he walks over to argue with me over not ordering anything except burgers.  What a jerk! I couldn't care less about your business peformance, I'm here to reward the ER staff, not improve your sales numbers. And like I said, I think your fries are lousy anyway. But the burgers went over and were gobbled up by the ER staff in about 15 minutes! Not a single person mentioned the missing fries."}
{"text":"Love in-n-out burger... wish they had one in Michigan where we will be moving to!"}
{"text":"Mmmm! Number 2 with extra onions and a root beer...yes please!! In-N-Out known for their incredibly delicious burgers and outstanding customer service. Walk in or drive thru the service is fast and efficient. I don't think I've ever waited longer than 5 minutes for my food. Even on a busy night. Try the secret menu which isn't such a secret anymore. ; )"}
{"text":"I recently lost much of my vision.  I came to this location with my neighbor.  One of the nice associates (Thomas) helped me out tremendously by bringing our order to the table, and even getting us some cat sup (my guess is he could see my white cane).  That is, in my opinion, service above and beyond, and is one of the reasons I love this location + the food is wonderful!"}
{"text":"This location was super busy, although I'm sure they all are! This was my first In-N-Out Burger experience and I really enjoyed it. We waited about 20/30 minutes for our food but there were no seats inside. We tried to sit outside but there was no shade and the seats were too hot from the sun. I recommend trying to find a table when you first get in. We ended up just walking around with our food, but it was still good!"}
{"text":"I am extremely glad that I live 5 hours away from an In-N-Out burger because more than likely I would be there every single day!  I live in Oregon so I needed to stop and have a bite when I was in Vegas.  There is not one bad thing I can say about this specific In-N-Out.  I went in approximately 15 minutes after they opened and even though there were quite a few people they were very fast and efficient.  The food is always fresh and made the exact same.  The menu is very simple and makes figuring out what you want very quick and easy. The workers are very friendly and patient with every customer. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love the fresh burgers and fries, simple menu, clean restaurant, friendly staff and consistent overall great experience I get every time I come in."}
{"text":"Every time I go there there's a very long line but normally gets through pretty quick They've got great food and the customer service is always excellent I don't like that it's on the corner and there's only one entry point but all in all good"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon.. it was packed...the food was good, but... There were flys everywhere! I had to keep swatting them away! And the chairs and tables were kinda dirty like they didn't really wipe them down. I really love in-n-out but this experience was okay.. I really hope they can improve."}
{"text":"Not sure what the love affair is, but people say that to me about Chicfila, so....  I do like it when I eat here, but just never do.   Fries are great, you can tell the buns are quality.  Otherwise, it is a fast food burger joint."}
{"text":"Overall - 3 stars...burgers are okay - fries are fresh cut and pretty good.....  Two words - ANIMAL STYLE!! Now that's a burger! 5-Stars for the animal style double double!! that's the only burger I will order here!   Everything else is good to fair for the price..."}
{"text":"Best fast food burger by far!!! Never have to pull to the side and wait. The order is always complete and not missing items. Thick and creamy shakes"}
{"text":"Usually like in-and-out burger. Not the one near the airport in Vegas. Under done meat, cold fries."}
{"text":"What more is there to say??? The burgers are worth thet weight in line. The fry's leave a little to be desired but they are ok. First rate service by the staff."}
{"text":"I just dont get it.  I dont understand how or why people brag about how great the food is here.  Sometimes I wonder if people really know what good food is.  I think people in general have come to accept truly average food as being spectacular in their eyes.    This place is no where near the hype it gets.  Truly the most over rated burger joint on the planet.  To each his own I guess? WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying."}
{"text":"Staff is really kind and cheerful.  They do get very busy but move through the line quickly.  I would have given them 5 stars, but it took quite awhile to get my food order.  God is always hot and fresh."}
{"text":"It saddens me to the core that they don't open until 10:30am. So, so not Vegas of them. Weak. I need beef"}
{"text":"I was excited to try In-N-Out as I've never been before, so I ventured off the strip and came here with the girlfriend. Ordered two cheeseburgers (animal style) and fries (also animal style). There was a lot of people but our order was cooked relatively quickly and we were able to find a spot.  Honestly, the burger was average at best. The patty was small and I've had much better fast food burgers from other places (Shake Shack, Five Guys). I'm glad I tried it, but won't go out of my way for it in the future. However, I was told later that I should have gotten the double double, and that would make the burger much better. So maybe one more shot when I'm near an In-N-Out in the future."}
{"text":"Burgers are obviously amazing! The cashiers are just boring. Talk a little bit. There's some Mexican guy that doesn't even speak good English and he's my cashier? Makes a lot of sense.. With all the money they make. Put some people that can talk."}
{"text":"Simply perfect!! Animal style fries is the way to go. Drive through time was short. The employees were very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is very delicious but there are only 3 things on the menu. The food is fresh and has some tomatoes and lettuce. It takes a long time to cook but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Another In-N-Out with delicious fast food burger and fries. It's located very close to the strip, so expect this place to be busier then other locations.  The food is same as other in-n-outs, but if you are really craving an In-n-Out burger, you might have to wait 15-30 minutes."}
{"text":"This is my go to location! Employees are always friendly and the food is always great.  This location is always pretty busy. Tables are hard to come by during their peak hours. The drive thru can also get a little cray cray during those peak times so beware of the craziness that is the parking lot.   There is plenty of seating inside and outside!  Get your fries \"well done,\" thank me later!"}
{"text":"This location always gets cray. (Is the word cray still in use, hmm?)  We went on a Tuesday around 10pm and the parking lot was full. The drive thru was LIT (Hehe, LIT) and the tables outside were all occupied. We made it inside and surprisingly there were a few empty tables.   Ordered the usual. A double double with no lettuce or tomato and with my fries well done! My friend ordered a double double with grilled onions! The tables were all pretty dirty and they looked as they hadn't been cleaned in probably a while, yuck.   In n out is great no matter what location you go too. The menu is simple. There are three different combos to choose from, and they also have a secret menu you can look up online, to be able to customize your order. Check it out!!  Cashier was super friendly (Tammy) and looked happy to be there, thank you!"}
{"text":"Please.  Can you spell OVERRATED crap?  What is all the hype about?  I swear, if memory serves me, In-n-Out was ok, definitely NOT great and that they served actual meaty burgers, not tiny McDs type, back in the 90s.  People rave and others have driven hundreds of miles to eat at In N Out. Seriously, they must be high. EZ Take Out Burger is far superior.  I last ordered a meal from In N Out in 2002 maybe, and it was trash.  I regrettably brought a group with me and was so embarassed that I subjected them to this lousy meal.  The service was rushed, the burger consisted of a PLAIN bun, with a tiny, flat, COLD pattie. The fries were mushy PLUS the price was outrageous for what was served.  Anybody that raves about that IN-N-Out junk MUST be smokin'!!  BORRRing..."}
{"text":"Came here to get my In-N-Out fix. The food was great as usual. Consistent as can be.  I went through the drive thrust around 10:15pm  and I was told by the female attendant on foot that In-N-Out does not have diet Lemonade.  I asked what do you call Light Lemonade then?  She did not say a word and just put in the order. No apology or anything. This is the first time I ever got misinformation at this establishment.  Otherwise everything else was great."}
{"text":"Never again! My elderly folks have been fans  of In and Out Burger for years and from time to time when I was with them I would partake since I had no choice other than go hungry... which I usually later regretted not taking that choice due to the extremely unremarkable food. So now I've gotten addicted to Five Guys burgers. But today with a carload of grandkids and no other quick burger choices anywhere near on our way to the park, we rolled through the In and Out Burger at Desert Ridge. What a waste of money. The burgers were completely over cooked, dry, tasteless, less than a quarter inch thick in the middle and hard, flat and crispy on the edges. No such thing as a kid's meal so per grands' requests I ordered four singles with just ketchup. Only one child ate theirs, 4 year old took one bite and said \"I don't like it.\" Three year old took lid off the bun, looked at hard thin patty and said, \"What is this?\" And started crying. I broke off a small piece for 15 month old and he spit it out. They weren't interested in the hard tasteless fries that were mysteriously hard and dry on the ends and soggy and limp in the middle...with dry, mealy centers. My double meat burger was choked down with the assistance of lettuce and tomato and their sauce. They forgot straws for the milk (which rather disconcertingly had today's date as the expiration date)... they did give us LOTS of extra napkins as requested and got my \"Arnold Palmer\" right. Next time I'll drive to just about anywhere than another In and Out Burger. I will give them this: reason elderly folks always give for wanting to go there is \"oh the burgers are always well done and never greasy and the fries don't have a lick of grease on them!\"  That's for damn sure!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed If you are from anywhere on the West Coast, you probably already know about In-N-Out. If you don't, come see what all the fuss is about. You will not be disappointed. You cannot find fresher fast food and for very reasonable prices. Food just arrived. Got to go...  Okay I'm back, and that was incredible. As I sit here fully content, basking in the afterglow of a wonderful meal, I thank God that I live in Arizona and I can experience this wonderfulness whenever I want.   Woe to you states without an In-N-Out. I truly hope your day will come. But for now,  consider planning your next vacation in CA, AZ, NV, TX, or UT."}
{"text":"Double Double animal style with grilled onions and a chocolate milk shake. Done Burp! excuse me. I truly dig this place. I can just sit in here for an hour and smash my burger slowly sip my rich thick milk shake and watch the staff jam out in a little fast food kitchen. Real cool ya. This place get real busy so if your in a hurry or actually believe that your the only person that exist in the world then go else where. Now if you want one of the tastiest fast food burger around, the heart stopper with fries. In and Out is the call. Prices are right in line with Jack and Ronald. But quality execution of this little menu is tip top. I  just 2ish they had mushrooms hence the four. Secret If you push on the table you can use the chair to crack your back when your stomach is massively over bulging."}
{"text":"You already know in n out is the best burger  for your buck . This location is always fast, and they always make sure you have the right order. Food always taste great!"}
{"text":"Asked for burger well done as usual....halfway through burger encountered large bright red zone. Too many teenagers make our food in this world. One adult burger chef should be hired at each in and out, otherwise this will keep happening. What are teenagers really good for anyway?  After complaining to corporate, will receive replacement burgers. They are very nice on the customer service phone line."}
{"text":"I FINALLY made it to In-N-Out Burger after seeing it off-strip for a decade of Vegas vacations.  I know this is In-N-Out blasphemy, but I don't see the appeal.  I like that the fries are hand-cut and the buns are preservative free, but everything else?  McDonald's with a fancy sauce.  Maybe I needed to get the not-so-secret animal style burger and fries to have this mind-blowing experience everyone seems to have here, but the regular old burger?  Meh.  Needless to say, I was not impressed, I don't get it, and I won't be back."}
{"text":"I knew my order would be wrong even after confirming it with both order windows, not well done, no pickles and the fries were hard as a rock, usually when their is a long line in the drive-thru that person takes the order and it is never wrong. Today I waited a long time no one was outside assisting with orders, not a great experience today"}
{"text":"I went here last night, and it was a great experience.  I ordered 3by3 with grilled onions, fries, and a drink.  My mouth almost dropped when the dude told me the total: $7.80!  I'm gonna eat here more often.  The staff was nice, the girl callin out the orders didn't hump your leg, but was still attentive.  Fries weren't oversalted, burger was cooked well, and the Dr. Pepper tasted gooood.  5 stars.  Keep up the good work in-n-out."}
{"text":"I love this place! Living in the East coast makes eating here a must when I'm in the proximity of an In-n-out burger place! I made it a point to find the closest one to where I was staying. We had the 3x3, protein burger,fries and vanilla shake. Heaven. Staff is always friendly no matter what location you go to! I hope that the next time I get another taste isn't 4 years from now."}
{"text":"I've almost always had good service at OTHER in n out locations, but good god, Desert Ridge's quality control and service standards are fucking garbage  In ONE month alone this In N Out location has served me:  1. a raw/pink burger, no thanks, I don't want to die. 2. the wrong burger, had cheese, I'm lactose intolerant 3. charge me for double double, give me single cheeseburger  Today has been strike 3, so I'm posting a complaint on all of INO's social media websites. I also messaged the Director of Marketing at In N Out, because for all the service pride that In N Out is usually good at, the Desert Ridge location puts the company to shame."}
{"text":"Goodness i LOVE In-N-Out Burger. Not only is it cheap, it is so YUM! My family of four was able to eat a filling meal for less than $25 - almost unheard of in Vegas!!  I went to In-N-Out for a late lunch after visiting the Hoover Dam. The burger was delicious and made just like I asked (mustard grilled with extra veggies), the fries were perfect and my Neapolitan milkshake was To-Die-For!!!! I love that everything tastes so fresh - and you can even see them making the fries from fresh potatoes.   Word to the wise - this is NOT on the strip - it looks like you can walk to it's glowing sign, but you will be fooled. Also, some cab drivers downright REFUSE to go there since they end up just waiting for you when they could be out making more money. The restaurant is also just average size - we were lucky enough to get a table, but as soon as we were done we saw several families standing around with their food not knowing what to do since there was no more seating :(. If you're visiting Las Vegas and are lucky enough to have a ride to this delicious restaurant, please go! You and your wallet will love it! P.S. Families - ask for In-N-Out hats for your kids! They will love it!  I wish they had an In-N-Out in San Antonio!! In-N-Out Burger please come to my city!"}
{"text":"Best hamburger place in Queen Creek/San Tan Valley area!!!!"}
{"text":"The panda made it over 29 years without having In-n-Out Burger. Really only because I've lived in states that don't have this place. People say, \"You gotta try this place!\" or \"I swear by this holy spot like some loyal worshiper!\" Um, sure.  I met up with some friends in Vegas for the Panda In-n-Out Initiation.  I pretty much stuck with the basic burger menu this time: Double-double, cheeseburger, and hamburger. I upgraded for an order of animal fries because I've always been intrigued by that. Total came to around $11.50 with tax.  Fresh vegetables are key to a burger. Check. Juicy patty? Check. Oh look, they toasted the bun! Win. The fries, as far as appearance goes, reminded me of McDonald's fries, but at least I saw the people actually placing the potatoes in the potato slicing machine. Can't beat that. All four of us still believe that there must be some type of drug in the animal sauce, because it left me wanting more burgers and fries.  A couple of my friends also got the well-done fries. That and a couple of protein burgers might be in order next time. With more animal sauce, of course.  There's a video of me eating the food. You know, just to document my initiation. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWuBDFVgK1w)  Unfortunately, I passed on the shakes this time. The panda can't handle excess dairy. The cheese in the burgers was enough. I do hear the shakes are good, though.  I'm a fan and I'll definitely return. Gotta tackle more of the secret menu next time!"}
{"text":"Where do I start?  You pull up to the drive thru, and there will be at least, and yes, I repeat, AT LEAST 3 cars in front of you.  Okay, their menu consists of 3 things, a double, a cheeseburger and a single. and french fries.. but who counts that? BORING.  By the time we got our food home (about 6 minutes away), it was ice cold. The cheeseburger I got, with grilled onions, really had no flavor. The spread took over the entire burger. For a company that emphasizes how \"fresh\" everything is, they really aren't playing it up to their advantage... So much potential.  Their fries, maybe \"fresh cut\". But are also lacking. Soggy, not crispy. They should take a lesson from McD's on their fries.  Overall, the paper wrapped burgers were greasy, and I am starting to feel the effects of it.......if you know what I mean (i know, I know, T-M-I).   But I am not impressed. Make your own fries and burgers at home, slap some Thousand Island on it, and you have In N out.... possibly tastier too.  so, meh. We've experienced better."}
{"text":"First time patron; loved it. We were expertly served by Wesley. If I lived in Scottsdale, it wouldn't be so bad because I could at least come here for delicious food and great service."}
{"text":"Your food will be made wrong every. Single. Time. You're better off going to smash burger across the street."}
{"text":"Delish, the fastest way to become obese if that's what you're after. Drive through lines are kind of long sometimes, but then they'll get the staff outside to take your order so that things are already in progress by the time you get up to the pay-window."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is always a good idea.   Their burgers are fresh, the potatoes are sliced moments before they hit the oil, and the buns are made the old fashioned way. It's absolutely delicious -- and everyone knows it, which is why there's always a line. But man oh man, the line is worth it!   The food somehow manages to be fast and cheap, while also tasting amazing, being of quality ingredients, and looking gorgeous.   Love that secret menu! So fun! I like ordering my burger \"protein style\" (lettuce wrap) and my boyfriend likes \"animal style\" - which is just awesome.   Plus, I'm pretty sure that In-N-Out makes it their business to only hire the friendliest people in the whole world. As recent transplants from NYC, we were startled and delighted by the bubbly kindness of the staff.   As my boyfriend likes to say, in a world where there is In-N-Out, why on earth go anywhere else? It sure does kick McDonald's ass."}
{"text":"I can never complain about this location and the quality of their service and quality. Granted I wish it was quicker, but I'll wait at 9 pm to get some food the way I want it. I always try to stump them ordering off their secret menu, but the end result is always impeccable. You go in n out, 2 for you."}
{"text":"They managed to mess up all 3 of our orders. We took them back to the counter so they could fix it, were the told it would be taken care of right away. 15 minutes later, still nothing, so we ask about our order, not a single employee knows what we were talking about. Finally gave up and asked for our messed up order back, that took another 10 minutes. No apology, no offer for a discount or even a free order of fries. I love in n out, but this location sucks and their customer service is horrible. At least apologize for your mistake after royally f*cking up THREE orders!"}
{"text":"I love In and out burger! its like the best evaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. too bad they dont have these in the midwest it would be such a hit! staff is always nice here and always makes what ya like."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers and fries one will ever have. Just like others who have written reviews about this joint, whenever I get a craving for some great burgers, I got to In N Out burger. It's such a satisfaction guarantee for burger cravings at this place. The food is made fresh and the prices are very reasonable. You get a fun enthusiastic staff who serve you and their energy is contagious. I am a big fan of this franchise and the location at Sunset and Marks is by far my favorite location to visit. Two thumbs up for this joint!"}
{"text":"Always the best in freshness and massively long lines.  No wonder they can't open too far away from their warehouses.  A massive at least 20 employees to fulfill your every burger, fry, and shake needs.  Plus don't forget the secret menus- extra veggies, animal style etc.  Always affordable, delicious, and a super long wait but worth it."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is always good and I've been to about a dozen of them. Wish we had them on the East Coast. I stopped here three times on my recent trip. Employees were all exceptional- friendly, well-trained, and efficient.  Enjoyed every bite of my burgers (which are WAY better than darling Shack Shack at several dollars cheaper).  Only knock: Pedestrian french fries. But still five stars."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of In-n-Out. I can usually count on consistent, great food. It's the only \"fast food\" I will eat and really the only burger. I typically get the same thing.... cheeseburger (protein style due to my wheat allergy) with pickles & onions, hold the spread & cheese fries, well done, layered cheese. It's always great so I was super excited when this location near my home opened up. I've never had any problems until tonight...  Go through drive thru & one person takes my order then another girl walks up and says they can't layer the cheese and starts to give me an explanation but I just said that they always do that (also I visited this specific location yesterday and no issues...) I just said if they can't layer the cheese, leave out the fries and she said it would be layered. I asked again when I picked up the food to make sure it was layered... just got home, cheese on my fries not layered and my burger feels oddly cold.... yeah, cold like the cheese didn't even melt AT ALL (see photo- I added the spread after)... I thought it was maybe OK but just bit into it and it's pretty inedible. Not sure what the deal is but this was a TERRIBLE experience and now I am wondering what I will eat for dinner since every part of my meal was no good."}
{"text":"Ya' know, you just can't go wrong with the ole In and Out! This location is no different than others- Friendly, fast service. Yeah, the menu is limited, and I'm not to keen on the french fries (a tad soggy), but its probably the best burger for the price in the western United States. Stopped here on the way up I-17 (very convenient) to a camping trip in Sedona. Quick stop, easy on and off freeway ordeal, had a fine lunch with burgers and animal fries. This joint is a winner!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out has always had a special place in my food loving heart. These burgers are simple but the quality and the love that goes into making them definitely stands out and this is why they've been around since 1948.   You will not find a quality burger cheaper than In-N-Out. When you look at the menu, it's short and to the point. One of the defining traits of this burger is the perfectly sliced onions they add. When it comes to onions, gimme the whole thing and I'll eat it like an apple!   Nothing is frozen including the fries. The potatoes are sliced in front of you so you know you're getting fresh cut fries. Let's talk price...cheap cheap cheap! For $5 and some change, you get a combo meal. If you go for the basic single patty burger, you'll pay under $5 and that's hard to find when we're talking quality. Hopefully it won't be another 10 years before my next visit!"}
{"text":"First time ever eating here it was  good nothing over the top wow but it was good. My fries were a little stiff and wierd tasting i had a number 2 which is a cheeseburger and fries. My husband had a flying dutchman and fries animal style he enjoyed his food. Overall service was great and the wait time was about five mins which isnt bad seeing that it was pretty busy."}
{"text":"We now live in San Antonio and really miss In-N-Out Burger. Every time we take a trip to the west coast, we go out of our way to eat at an In-N-Out. The food is always good and the prices are terrific. Perhaps most amazing is the quality of service.   My typical meal order is a double-double with ketchup and cheese only. I order this basic burger to enjoy the quality of burger meat and flavor. Their fries are also the best in fast food. Fresh cut in the store and well seasoned.   There are not many negatives to say about any of my experiences at In-N-Out."}
{"text":"In-expensive and always good. Animal style! Well done fries!"}
{"text":"I love In-n-Out and I visit one every chance I get (living in Denver, this is not terribly often). This is a large, extremely busy, and clean location. Great customer service and as usual delicious burgers. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Been going to this location for many years now. Friendly service and good consistent food. The drive thru is usually always packed so it's better for you to come in and order."}
{"text":"Is there really anything bad to say about in n out? I mean come onnnnn! Probably the best fast food burger you can get. Animal style it all!! Please & thank you. While this location can be a bit crowded sometimes, they never fail to make it speedy. They obviously know how to work it cause they get you in n out in a jiffy! The food is always fresh, juicy, crisp, and animal styled just right! The scent just driving by this joint is hypnotic. I love in n out. As \"basic\" as it is, it's freaking delicious! I usually get my burger protein style and I don't even miss the bun cause it's honestly all about he burger and those fried onions! Seriously, my mouth is watering now. G2G! Make sure you swing by this location cause everyone is super nice and super efficient! P.s. the shakes are FAN FREAKING TASTIC TOO!!"}
{"text":"Like any other self-respecting Southern California native, I love In-N-Out. So this review could very well be for any of the locations.  But lately, and what prompts this particular review - is that it is pretty much my go-to spot when I'm actually following my low carb diet and need food fast!! Whether its a double-double protein style or two cheeseburgers protein style - I love it.  Even before I started low carbing, sometimes I'd eat a burger protein style just because the crisp lettuce wrap gives the burger a nice fresh taste."}
{"text":"You just can't go wrong here.  In N Out is just AMAZING. They're fast, but their speed does not take away their quality. Yum yum.. don't forget to ask for some spread.."}
{"text":"I want to give BIG kudos to Corey C. He was great! Everything was perfect, down to my lettuce request. Unlike the other young lady who argued with me for 5 mins about a cup for hot water.  She said they didn't have cups for \"HOT\" water, but had cups for coffee.  REALLY!? I requested to speak with a manager, she tells him the problem and he looks at her and says, \"Give her a cup.\"  Good call to the manager.    Do they not teach customer service anymore to the young people?"}
{"text":"This is one of the main reasons why I gained so much weight when I lived in Las Vegas, it's so close to UNLV campus!  I absolutely love In-N-Out. A lot of people would say this place is overrated but as someone who lives in Seattle and has no source to these awesome hamburgers and often dreams of double doubles with animal fries, I can tell you that this place is the real deal.    I can only fantasize until the day one of these places opens up in Washington, till then I still think of you secretly.  SO WANTY."}
{"text":"Super fast and delicious. We came here for dinner on Christmas eve and the place was packed but they still managed to get our order to us quickly. My mom and I split my favorite Neopolitan shake (they actually split it between two cups which is nice). We all enjoyed our hamburgers and fries. Only $20 for four of us to eat!! P.S. You can get extra vegetables on your burger at no extra charge and you can also ask them to cut your burger in half if you are sharing."}
{"text":"For me this is a more personal review than most. When I first arrived in Phoenix in 2013 on the I-10, this particular In-N-Out was a familiar sight for sore eyes. Three years later, and this same INO location still never ceases to deliver on their values through good food and good service.  Now, in 2016, I make this location a frequent re-visit as it is so close to Estrella Mountain Community College.   As far as food goes, try getting their burgers animal style. Google it if you're unfamiliar, there are \"secret menu\" options that every INO to the best of my knowledge delivers on."}
{"text":"I visit here quite often,  Great service, great food. The staff is always kind & they're always quick even if it is packed. Reasonable prices. Their shakes are pretty good."}
{"text":"Best experience ever! With most of the In N Out Burger locations expect to wait a little while in the drive thru but it is well worth the wait. The employees were very friendly as well as very efficient. Excellent customer service and the food was hot and delicious. If you haven't checked out In N Out of Surprise yet, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Love in n out ! So good ! There always so busy at this location whether drive thru or eating in. No matter what you wait anywhere from 15-30 mins."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite fast food place. Great fries, burgers, malts,  etc. cool tee shirts too!  Consistently excellent service, cleanliness, quality, price, and quantity. A \"must go to\" whenever I'm in Arizona, Texas and points west. My only complaint is they will not open out of Nevada, Utah, Arizona and Texas!"}
{"text":"They have a retail store yippee I was able to pick up some cool stuff. Good place to find a shirt and other items"}
{"text":"I love the burgers here , which keeps me coming back again , and again. The only down fall to this chain is the traffic congestion ! Don't care which one you go to , unless it is off the wall hours, parking and dinning in, can be a pain. Wish the fries stayed warm longer, certainly room for improvement. But of all the fast food places out there , this is one of my go-to's."}
{"text":"I can tell In-N-Out Burger has extremely high standards because the service is always amazing and the burgers are in a league of their own.  What really keeps me going back is the service chicks who operate the voice box/ window.  They're unusually friendly for  human beings who live in the 21st century.  I mean, it's like they have no stresses and simply love operating a burger window.  It's almost as if  it's their \"calling\".  All joking aside, In-N-Out has top-notch customer service.  Great job!!!"}
{"text":"Finally went for the first time. AMAZING, 4x2animal animalfries choco shake. YUM, will definitely be adding this to one of my post workout go tos. The employees are great, the food is fresh, and I love the fries."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Las Vegas I ALWAYS stop at this In-n-Out, no matter what! I don't think words can do this burger justice. It tastes so fresh, smells so good, I just love it! Cheeseburger, no onion, add pickle - just insanity on a bun! The best burger I have ever had! This location is always clean and service is fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"If Their was a 0 star I would give it to them. I came from New York to visit Vegas everyone keeps taking about in n out burger i was like let's try it out. Had the food after not even 10 minutes my stomach was killing me. Had food poisoning shake shack will always be the best. I am happy I try it in n out burger first and last time."}
{"text":"I rarely miss the chance to eat @  In-N-Out Burger when I'm in the West.  Stopped here and the employee helped us discover the \"hidden\" menu.  Double Double Protein style is the way to go.  2x meat, 2x cheese, fries and a diet Coke is my goto at In-N-Out"}
{"text":"It's ok, good for a quick bite. I don't understand the almost cult like following. Made a mistake and had the shake instead of pop and was sick for hours. Staff was very friendly, but they needed someone dedicated to keeping the place clean."}
{"text":"Best hamburgers around. We never miss I&O whenever we are out west, They are an inhale-able addiction without the legal ramifications of cocaine. yum yum yum They really have it down. Service is always great. And the fries, oh my."}
{"text":"We are from a land barren of I&O.  The LOML almost lost his mind when we discovered I&O across from the hotel we stayed out while visiting family. He has spent lots of time on the west coast and lived on these burgers, apparently. He ate there about 5 times over 3 days.  I hate burgers and I even ate there once and liked it very much. It was cool, burgers were great, we were happy.  That is all."}
{"text":"Perfect lunch and late, late night grub hub, it's  my daughter's first time to Arizona and she had to make a stop here right off here flight.  Burgers (Double, Double), fries animal style are the best. Food quality/quanity is best for your .  We've been to Dallas and had it there but it's different in Arizona for some reason. Love the atmosphere and staff they always have a smile when greeting/taking your order. The Tempe location is close to ASU so be patient as there will wait, but it's worth it. Yes for the quality of food that you received is worth the time as it's fresh.  So where every your travels take you and there's an \"In & Out\"  around go ahead and stop in grav some good food and enjoy. It's worth the wait and time."}
{"text":"In and Out it's okay bc that's what you guys have out here but the fries suck and if you have ever had five guys on the east coast you will understand their burgers are the greatest... Compared to 5 Guys!"}
{"text":"The first time we came here we didn't love it, but this is a great option for late night food.  Would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Being a So Cal native, I never saw what the big deal is with this place for out of tonwners! Its OK, its a big, sloppy burger. And, its fast food. OK... Big deal. Their french fries suck, they are mushy and crisp. They have a very limited menu, which I guess is sort of the appeal. There are much better burgers in town and I don't think this place is any good at all."}
{"text":"Typical In N Out. Quality ingredients, basic menu. The service at this location was pretty fast for In N Out standards."}
{"text":"Great fast food place!!  The prices can't be beat and their food is excellent compared to other fast food places.  I love the \"veggi\" burger (aka, grilled cheese and topping burger).  Also, love the secret menu online!"}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Just an average, forgettable burger. If there was a Five Guys in the area, I would pass on this place."}
{"text":"Love in & out but this restaurant has difficult access..I mean ridiculous!  There is literally one way in and out (pun intended).  Can't access the drive thru easily and trying to get out of the parking lot you've got this big median to contend with.  Forget about it if you have a trailer."}
{"text":"They're all awesome, all the time. Real fries from freshly cut real potatoes!"}
{"text":"They're all awesome, all the time! Real fries from freshly cut real potatoes!"}
{"text":"Never have had a less than great experience at any In-N-Out; this location is no exception. Honestly, I could probably eat it everyday, for the rest of my life. Reppin' the Fat Kid Crew! Nice & speedy staff. Great service & fresh food. I love how they always repeat your order back to you. Now that's \"quality control\"! Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I love this place. I come here every vegas trip.  Burgers are soo good, just fresh and moist and lots of cheese. you cant really compare then to gormet or resturaunt burgers (they are not thick) but if you compare them to other fast food places,  there is no comparison.  The buns are really good and i love it how they have chili on the side.  Staff is always nice.  I wish they had these in NY."}
{"text":"When we moved to Vegas, one of the best things was of course that access to In-N-Out Burger.  Even though the are always packed, it is never a horribly long wait to get our food.  My young daughter loves that she is always given stickers when we go.  Being able to actually see them making the fries is just a bonus!"}
{"text":"On this particular occasion, I was with some out of town, first timers :)   We got fries EVERY STYLE to feed a bunch of us. The server taking our order was extremely patient with the whole process.  Arrived at 12:30am on a Saturday. The place was clean and well staffed. Everything was stocked and the wait time was reasonable considering the number of customers. What more can you really expect from a fast food spot?? Still, the impressed by with little things, like polite recommendations and bringing food out to people when they don't hear their number called.  Well don't folks. Considering the crap location, they pull off a great presentation."}
{"text":"Very efficient staff and very clean lobby. No problems to report,very good experience! Wish they were available in MN!"}
{"text":"In-n-out is one of my favorite places in AZ and this one doesn't disappoint. The staff is always friendly and welcoming and the restaurant is always clean. The bathrooms are a little outdated but other than that it's a great experience. In-n-out typically taste the same across the board, although I've found that some locations are better than others. Overall, it's always a great and delicious visit!"}
{"text":"OMG I love this place!!! Im from Canada and this is \"continentally\" good"}
{"text":"Always a long line since they do not have very many of these out here. The burgers are always good quality and the grilled onion option is great. I wish they would put more sauce on the animal fries but everything was still great."}
{"text":"Animal style? Oh heck yes any day shoot make that a doubled double instead. This is the 3rd time that I've tried in and out ever sense I moved to the mainland. At first I was like WTH only 4 items on the menu, did not know that they had secret slangs. But I have to say they make some bomb burgers and the fries are fresh too! not frozen!."}
{"text":"Resident of Maryland and I'm here for an event. Had to try In N Out and the thing that shocked me most was price. I'm down with fast food price for fresh burgers. Had 2 double doubles protein style. Before I fly back going to get a 4X4 and animal fries"}
{"text":"I stopped eating most fast food a few years ago.  That basically means that I cut out McDonald's, Burger King, Carl's Jr., etc. and haven't been at any of those places since.  But I still head over to in n out sometimes.  The beef is never frozen and the burger simply taste better.  The only fast food I eat now are in n out and chik fil a.    Double double animal style protein style please!!!"}
{"text":"Great time here.  Had a blast and the food along with the service was fast. They knew exactly what they were doing at this restaurant"}
{"text":"There's a million different burger places in Vegas. They're around every corner. Which to choose from?! Sorry Gordon Ramsey, all we wanted was that good ol In-N-Out Burger! It's about a 15min walk from New York but just make sure you cross over the bridge on the Excalibur side, and never go under the bridge!   I had a regular cheeseburger and my guest had a Double Double. I wish I had gotten a Double Double because I felt like a regular needed more meat! That Double Double was delicious! Idk what they do but it's not like any other burger out there! Yum! Fries are OK.   This location is infested with people, 5 min wait to order, a beehive inside, and everyone is happy chowin down! Living in the Midwest this place is inaccessible so I savored every bite!"}
{"text":"Love in and out, make no mistake, but getting in and out ( ha,ha) of the parking lot is a bit of a hassle. So , I need a compelling reason to come to this location ."}
{"text":"This is one of my stops every time I visit Vegas. Living on the East coast I don't get this at home. I have also hit this chain in Phoenix. I am a burger junkie so when I walk in I ask what is the biggest burger you have. In Vegas and in Phoenix they told me about the four patty burger that isn't on the menu. I get it every time now. I will be staying at the Linq in two weeks and will definitely be stopping in for my burger while in town. Perfect location too considering the it's located behind the Linq on the promenade.."}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii and recently moved to Las Vegas and hearing all the hype of In and Out we went to Oceanside California and tried it and did not like it!  Now we moved to Las Vegas and gave this one on blue diamond its by the target and kohls off of Blue Diamond wow everyone is really nice , Clean and the food was Awesome.  So if you tried another in and out and didnt like it try this one!"}
{"text":"Burgers are good but not the best I've ever had. Fries are always soggy so if you like crisp fries don't bother here. Milkshakes are not ice cold ever!  I think shakes should be thick and freezing cold. So in & out is better than typical drive thrus but not enough to keep me coming back a lot."}
{"text":"I've tried this burger and fries plenty of times. Still not that exciting... Burger is good but you can have the fries. Service is always friendly."}
{"text":"Sorry I just don't get some of the hype here. The burgers are meh. I like a meaty juicy burger and not these well done drier patties. Fries especially suck. I get that they are all about freshness but taste and texture is important to me too. For a fresh concept fast food burger, I would rather go for Shake Shack or Five Guys, which is much juicier and flavorful.  Still, my preference for an awesome burger is one that uses some fattier cuts of well seasoned meat and can be cooked to a juicy medium rare."}
{"text":"The awesome taste of the burgers is still there as I remember it years later. Even though we went for lunch time and it was crazy busy, we only waited for 2 meals only about 15min. Place is clean, friendly staff. Also my favorite thing to ask for is ANIMAL style fries and burgers.   IN N OUT IT WAS GOOD HERE AS ALWAYS !"}
{"text":"The line was very long, which it usually is.  It was extra specially long because it was a Sunday night.  I'm sure all the travelers were getting their food for the ride home.  Despite that, I felt that the wait for my order was not unreasonable.  This store knew how to handle the rush, 3 cashiers and a billion people working in the kitchen and counter.  My only concern was that I was called to pick up my order, but they didn't give me my shake, I had to ask for it.  I've worked fast food before and I remember one cardinal rule is to make sure the order is complete.  But that's ok, I'll still come back."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've ever been here. The first time I was not impressed at all. This time I was starving and also on a special diet so I could not eat bread. I ordered protein style burger with cheese. It was surprisingly very tasty."}
{"text":"Speedy and friendly service.  I love that you can see them making your order through the large windows in the drive-thru.  Fresh cut french fries are the best!!!"}
{"text":"I'm glad I finally tried this place out, but I don't get the hype. Definitely impressed at their efficiency and friendliness, but their food - not so much. I got the cheeseburger combo with animal style fries and a strawberry shake. The cheeseburger was like a cheeseburger, but gotta give props to the really fresh lettuce and tomato that they used. The fries were like limp strings of potato with absolutely no crispiness to it. The animal style sauce was - salad dressing? And the strawberry shake was decent, but it would get warm so quickly even in the restaurant that I would have to go through some gross warm shake before I got to the good stuff. The food is so so so heavy though that I passed out when I got back to the hotel and probably gained a couple pounds. But hey! It's worth it for the experience."}
{"text":"Good service & clean place all the time. I like how the employees work as a team. However, I had to wait longer, even today when they're not that busy but any way the waiting time is worth it I guess.  They're all helpful. Thank you guys. (:"}
{"text":"Who does not like In-N-out \"animal style\" burgers huh?!  I love their burgers everytime I crave for one."}
{"text":"My husband drove to this In-N-Out Burger a few years before as part of an epic life-search journey (think Harold and Kumar go to White Castle--but driving from Minnesota to Arizona). Needless to say, when we realized we'd be close to the \"In-N-Out Burger that started it all\", we had to stop by.   Twice.   All in all, great service, good food, very clean, and relatively quick (they make everything as you order it). I had one of my Double-Doubles with raw onions and one with fried onions (do the latter of the two). Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out Burgers! They're burger taste so good. I love the Double-Double burgers. My favorite secret menu (not so secret menu really!) item is the Animal Fries without the sauce. The shakes are always great! Yummy!! It's very clean inside. The service is always friendly and fast! Lots of parking in the lot. Almost always a long line for the drive thru. I still have their song stuck in my head. In N Out, that's what a hamburger's all about!"}
{"text":"If hamburgers were art, In-N-Out knows how to create a masterpiece every time.  In-N-Out is a perfect example of a restaurant who does a few things extremely well and strives for perfection in the things they do.  We don't have these where I come from and we were first introduced in Dallas.  Traveling in the far West, this was our go-to favorite and first choice for a meal on the run.  In my experience, every burger I've ever had at In-N-Out has been perfect.   Don't know how they do it but I hope they don't change ANYTHING."}
{"text":"Being on the east coast, I don't get the pleasure of In-N-Out burgers. These burgers are absolutely delicious and I was notified of the secret menu beforehand, although I chose not to order from there. I got extra sauce with my burgers and it made for a messy delicious burger. I ended up going two times in one day and I don't regret a single calorie consumed."}
{"text":"This  place is always happy. Thanks again to miss Genesis Pa ( according to my receipt) . She is very sweet and patient. I can only eat gluten free food and I tried to order a burger with no bun and she didn't look at me like an alien, instead she said something like: \" you'd like it lettuce wrapped?\" . Me: Awww yes pls and thank you!!! Oh and bathrooms are always clean! Let's not forget that the food is delicious too"}
{"text":"I love IN-N-OUT!! This location is super busy our line is always way into the parking lot going down to the other stores. It would help them if they had two drive thru's  but they have no room for that either. We both got cheese burgers with animal style fries and cokes. Just over $10 for two people in which we get full is great. My only complaint is we live down the street and we went straight home and my animal fries were COLD!! I did pop them into the microwave for a few seconds and they were good. The staff that waited on us was very friendly and accurate to what we ordered. Always will go back."}
{"text":"Best fast food burgers and the menu is so  simple and easy. Always get my hamburger animal style. Did the unthinkable.  I tried the 4x4 for those who don't know that is a hamburger with four patties and I ate it all."}
{"text":"Do you want a good quality burger for cheap? Do you feel like places with unlimited toppings and multiple menu items require too much time? Do you like your fries under seasoned and just ok? Then In-N-Out is the place for you. Great burgers, few options, meh fries."}
{"text":"These guys are assholes. Straight up.  I respectfully made my order at the drive thru.  Asked for a double double plain with ketchup.  He continued to ask me if I wanted onions and cheese almost as if he were mocking me.  Then when I ordered a milkshake he pretended like all of the sudden he couldn't hear me.  Pulled up to the window to pay, he's trying to insult me and being disrespectful, however I had my dog in the car and just simply wanted some dinner..  When I pulled up to the next window, there were three different people who \"helped me\" to finally receive my order, and I say helped in that way because smiled at me in the ugliest and fakest way. They boxed my food up oddly so I wouldn't bother to go thru the trouble to sit right in the drive thru line and check my food.  Who else knows what they did to this food, honestly.  I'll never go back to this location and you can count on one thing, neither will my friends.  It's a shame y'all hate your job so much :( Poor things"}
{"text":"I love in n out. The consistency and the prices is what keeps us coming back. What I dislike is the long wait, inside or drive thru. Its quick compared to the demand but its still the drawback of coming here"}
{"text":"I know, I know. I should give it 5 stars because it's such an exclusive West coast experience. And I do love it whenever I'm able to have it. But this was sooo disappointing!   First, the fries were cold and hard. How do you expect me to spend calories on cold fries? That's a total waste. Only $7 for a burger, fries and a drink but animal style is $2 more. My burger was good but mostly bread. They serve coke products with DIY free refills but no club soda. What the hell?? Please put a button for just club soda (no syrup).  Also taking off a star because they don't have a bathroom on premise. But the cold, hard fries such a fast paced environment is inexcusable."}
{"text":"Coming to the west coast we had to stop here to see what all the rave is about. I got the double double with an animal fries and I can kinda see the hype. The burger tasted freshly made and the toppings on the animal fries were delicious. The sauce it was topped off with kind of tastes like a different version of the Big Mac sauce. I'm not really a big fan of the fries here though because they're a little soggy. Definitely a cheap meal in a very expensive city is always a plus."}
{"text":"I have never been to and In and Out Burger. Prices are decent. Menu seems very limited to me. It's very clean with plenty of seating indoor and outdoor. Bathrooms were cleaned. There were lots of staff on line working and communicating well together. While waiting for our food, I over heard the staff made up of young teens  encouraging each other on  jobs well done. They are were working well together to process orders efficiently. Great staff! My cheese burger was good. Fries could have better. Not crispy enough for me."}
{"text":"So excited I finally got to experience in-n-out burger! The burgers were absolutely amazing and super reasonable, especially considering Vegas prices! The fries are something I would say you could do without. They are not the best. Absolutely must give this burger a try !"}
{"text":"Love this place, HOT cheap yummy burgers ..what more could you want? Food is good, but it bothers me to see these poor people outside in the heat having to take people's orders.  This is a complaint in general for all in-n-out burgers so minus 1 star...otherwise great."}
{"text":"Great burgers, good prices, fast service what more could you ask for? How about a mean shake to go along with it.  Best burgers from a fast food chain."}
{"text":"Anthony Bourdain claims whenever he's in a city with an In-n-Out Burger it's the first place he stops after arriving and the last place he stops before leaving.  That said a LOT!  We couldn't believe how packed it was at 3PM. Further disbelief came from how quickly we got to order, even though I bet there was 50 people ahead of us in line. We also were blown away by how quickly we received our order. The seating is limited, but the 2 times we were there people were kind enough to budge up to free 2 seats for us, even if it meant a few parties had to mingle. All part of the fun!  And did it live up to its hype? Yeesh! We were instant fans! One nice thing about a simple menu is that a place gets really good at doing things right. We even saw them chopping up potatoes for their fries, right there at the restaurant! No bags of frozen spuds!  Restaurant was clean, service was cheerful and efficient, food was Uh-MAZING, and the prices were so low......it's now the first place we stop after arriving in town and the last place we stop before leaving!  P.S. If you're the tourist type (when in Rome!) visit the gift shop next door. Every t-shirt has something special in it. The tee I got has a roadster with the members of ZZ Top in it rolling through an In-N-Out Burger drive thru. Rob's tee has the original owners in his  drive thru. Kinda cool!"}
{"text":"Prob one of the best of the fast food type burger places but way overrated. They definitely have a cult following.  I have to say the burger is really good especially as animal style (one of the not so secret menu options). It is so small though you have to get at least a double or even a triple to be satisfied (3x3 good option). So once you have ordered a 3x3, animal style you got a nice sized burger that has all the right cheese gooeyness, grilled onion and sauce to boot. (prob is it hikes up the price).  I have to say the fries just suck (these are fighting words to the in-n-out lovers). They are cut fresh but they don't cook them right. They are soggy little suckers so i have to say Fry well (or well done) to get them in some sort of crispiness but then they are almost cooked to much. So i usually don't order anymore. They need to learn how to do the twice cook method (blanch then crisp)  Shakes are ok but nothing special what so ever. I do like how they have little hot yellow chiles if you want them."}
{"text":"I love in and out, it's the typical horrible parking , but it's all about the burger, and that's why I try to find off hours to go.....The staff has always been helpful and friendly to me ."}
{"text":"Man this place gets crowded, have waited in line to get a burger to go. But what a burger....it's like crack. Best fast food burger, hands down."}
{"text":"Good quality and basic = just right.    Very effieceint and hard working team behind the counter as well."}
{"text":"Best part of living on the West Coast is In-n-Out Burger, hands down. I had heard quite a bit about it prior to moving to Vegas, so I knew the second we got here I had to try it. Luckily this particular location is close by.   Cheeseburger animal style is truly heaven on Earth!   The Blue Diamond branch has never caused me any issues. They do tend to get busy around lunch and dinner times, but the employees do a great job of moving people along fairly quickly.   You can bet any time I have out of town guest from the East, we make a stop at In-n-Out!"}
{"text":"normally i would say 5 stars but an incident at this in n out yesterday makes me have to put 3. unfortunately, my chocolate shake and spread on the side, 2 integral parts of the meal, were left out of my drive through order. this fumble left me with too many questions. how would i achieve optimal spread levels? what would i dip my fries into to get that perfect salty-sweet flavor combo? i dont know, in n out. you tell me."}
{"text":"I like 5 guys burgers and fries better, but this place is still pretty good.  I just wish they had more options for toppings.  The fries here are pretty good.  I would love to have some ranch or fry sauce, but not sure if they have those available, I didn't see it.  This place is always pretty busy so you might have to deal with crowds and not many seating options."}
{"text":"I went to this In-N-Out for lunch after spending a long hot morning at the Autoplex looking at cars.  It was a welcome relief to step into the cool restaurant and get a double double, fries and a LARGE iced tea to quench our thirst.  The meal was very good, the counter help was nice and the restaurant was clean, including the restroom.  The place was packed but we were lucky to score a table without any trouble."}
{"text":"Great value right in the heart of the strip of Las Vegas. Seem to have regular prices in an area where even McDonald's is overpriced. As a result be patient...it's packed most of the time."}
{"text":"Whether I get an animal-style 4x4, a fry light or a tomato-wrapped, mustard-fried doublemeat, I thoroughly enjoy all aspects of In-N-Out Burger. I appreciate that every burger is made to order and that all of their ingredients are fresh and never frozen. No In-N-Out location owns a freezer, heat lamp or microwave like other fast food places. Whenever I have visited, I have noticed that the customer service is superb. The associates are always courteous, polite and helpful. I appreciate that they put their customers first."}
{"text":"Ok food for decent price ..  The Good: people behind the counter were nice to speak to. Food was ok  The Bad: wait time was 15 mins which seems to be not too bad.  The Ugly: none  Final thoughts: stop by if you crave cheap burger and can wait 15-30 mins, I personally think Wendy's  tastes better."}
{"text":"Had to try In-N-Out Burger before I leave back to Hawaii and my animal style burger & fries tasted better than I dreamed it would be. My family and I wanted to enjoy the atmosphere of In-N-Out so we ate inside but it was hella busy. Our table was dirty and it took one of the employees about 5 minutes just to wipe our table. That is why I had to remove 1 star. I will return here when I come back to Vegas. Aloha!"}
{"text":"Double double burger was extremely good and a decent price. Cheaper than a Big Mac which cannot compare at all, and cheaper than a lot of places I'm used to in Wisconsin. Visiting Arizona and we had to stop because we've heard good things. Definitely was not disappointed. Pink lemonade was good also. But could pass on the fries I've had better. But would come back in a heart beat for another cheap really good burger"}
{"text":"In-N-Out cooks up one mean burger, but I prefer Five Guys' burgers and fries over In-N-Out's so I'm not really upset that this chain is only on the west coast.  One person I went with ordered their burger \"animal style\" which is where they take the sacred formula of hamburgerdom and essentially rape it. They put your meat on almost inedible amounts of iceberg lettuce. Nice. Meat grease beading on top of cold, flavorless lettuce, dripping all over your crotch. It's just wrong."}
{"text":"Not horrific , not the transcendental experience I expected based on their press , the fries were dry and floury in texture and the burger looked like it came out of a frozen pack although it was tasty."}
{"text":"It's been over 10 months since I took a bite out a nice juicy In-N-Out Burger. Just happens to be I am in Phoenix this week and as soon as the plane touched down I was off to In-n-Out Burgers. It totally had nothing to do with a fellow Yelper checkin' in an In-N-Out in California. Nope! Not at all... ;)  In the world of burger franchises one can argue that success cannot be measured by the billions you have served or the number of locations you have worldwide alone. In-N-Out has been very successful in its own right. Burgers and fries cooked and prepared using fresh ingredients. Efficient, accurate and consistent every time. One look at their menu and you'll see why In-N-Out in my opinion blows any of its competition out of the water. You're not going to find chicken nuggets here or a side salad. No way! Their menu is simple. If you walk in here and you don't like meat, In-N-Out will accommodate you by not adding a patty. If you are into high protein diets, no worries, In-N-Out will be more than happy to serve you a burger minus the bun. You can have those burgers and fries any way you want. You may add as many pattys as you want to your burger or cook your fries crispy. With a menu so simple, people have yet to figure out that you can have your In-N-Out in dozens different ways.  So how does a Ninja have his in-N-Out burgers? (see attached photo) The ceremonial meal starts by placing the food in a sorta' feng shui for Ninjas. Important to keep the harmony between the Burger, fries and milk shake. Place the Double Double animal style at 3 o'clock, Fries well at 6 o'clock, dipping spread at 9, chocolate milk shake at 11 and a cup of water at 2. Bite into the Double Double and chew it 4 times, grab 3-4 fries, dip fries into dipping sauce, insert in mouth with half chewed burger and wash it down with a chocolate shake. Buurp!   No need to elaborate on my rating. 4 solid stars for In-N-Out Burger and the only way In-N-Out will get that coveted 5 Ninja stars is if Lynsi Torres decides to marry me and or give me my own In-N-Out franchise. I won't do both..."}
{"text":"Solid Fast Food Joint.  A little bit slow on the prep time, but the taste more than outweighs the wait.  Not as crowded as most In-N-Out burgers either.  Very nice, very clean.  I'm craving to go back now!  AWG!  I want another burger!"}
{"text":"The employees here are ALWAYS genuinely super friendly. Get the grilled cheese animal style and fries well done. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Always a great place for a late night burger when you don't want to spend time at a restaurant. I got the double double with grilled onion and it was pretty spectacular - cheesy and messy and just what I needed since I was starving. The sauce they put on the burger is tangy and delicious!"}

{"text":"I am sure I don't have to Hype this place up more than everyone on here already has, but if you have still not tried an In-N-Out burger in your lifetime... I will highly recommend making that a future goal(if you like burgers,aaaand your not a vegan ofcourse). I always come to this location at least once when im in Vegas, remembering how there was only one location years ago in this city and it was always packed!!(no matter what time of the day you went). Being from SoCal, growing up having In-N-Out frequently, I have to say that In-N-Out has been consistently THAT GOOD throughout the years. One of the Best Hamburger joints out there, if not THE BEST!!"}
{"text":"Went here last week with a couple friends and had quick service and tasty fries and burgers. The restaurant was very clean and I saw the staff frequently cleaning through our visit and I even got something off the secret menu that I can't talk about hush hush! But I was very pleased with how friendly the staff was and next time I have a few extra bucks I plan on going back!"}
{"text":"Nice simple burgers and fries.  Ask for extra crispy fries.  Yum!  And best of all...no MSG (monosodium glutemate).  Can't say the same for Windy's or Panda Express. Their food makes me physically sick."}
{"text":"Came here based on In-N-Out's reputation and it's a nice place that stays busy and with good reason. Located on the UNLV campus, it's on a corner that allows for drive-up and parking for in-store dining. The place is clean, inside and out and stayed busy the whole time I was there. The staff was friendly for a fast-food place with fresh, clean matching uniforms. They processed orders quickly and efficiently and while I waited a little longer than expected, it was worthwhile. Sat outside and ate at a built-in table area and thought \"This is the way to do fast-food\". It was good (fries a little too salty) and I was able to eat and keep things moving, which is what I was looking for."}
{"text":"I ordered a pair of double-doubles (is that double-double-double?) with onion only.  and my order took almost twice as long as my friends that I came with.  Not sure why mine took so long to make.  They arrived hot, cheese melted and the onion between the 2 patties.  The flavor was good.  The fries were not crispy rather wilted instead.  I'm not sure but it seems like they're not doing a blanch fry first before they do the deep fry.  I would give them a better rating if the fries were more crispy."}
{"text":"Locals, you should be thankful for In-N-Out!!! I travel back and forth from Philly and I always make this a mandatory stop.  It's just the best you can get and it's cheap.  Get your burger Animal Style!  It's the only way I go.  Ask for your fries well-done.  And you can even bring your vegetarian friends: they can order a grilled cheese off of the secret menu.  The grilled cheese is essentially the cheeseburger without the meat: special sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions (if you so choose).  It's what my girlfriend orders.  No other fast food chain can hold a candle to In-N-Out.  Only problem is that my cholesterol is off the charts now...  But me thinks that's a small price to pay for such good food.  :)"}
{"text":"The burgers are great but you guys should provide shade  or something to your poor employees standing outside in FULL SUN in 97 degree AZ weather.  I've seen some of these guys standing out there for a while...it's a bit inhumane in my opinion. Shame on the mgrs they should have to stand out there with no cover to see how they like it :("}
{"text":"I would say out of all the In-N-Out locations I've been to in vegas this would be the worst one. First I ordered animal style fries and wanted them crispy when they came out and ate some of the fries it didn't taste crispy at all. Second I understand they can't control how busy it is in there so I'm not going to fault them on that, but please make sure that there is someone wiping tables down because all of them were dirty. I also ordered a fountain drink which the pink lemonade tasted like it was watered down. I'm not asking a whole lot but I feel this location needs to be on the same level with customer satisfaction and with its food compared with the other locations in vegas."}
{"text":"I frequent this place waaaay too much, but I know it's better quality than any other fast food place so screw it. This is one of the fastest in n outs, compared to the one on Lake Mead, Centennial, Sahara, and the other Tropicana location. But still be prepared to wait 15 minutes or so for your food. Their food is delicious and it's cheap. I can get a whole meal here for around $7. It's basically the only fast food I eat anymore, and everyone always agrees on in n out."}
{"text":"Alana is amazing!!! She helped us with our pain in the butt order for our friend out in Washington who is in desperate need of In-N-Out! We might be taking it on a plane, but hey!! For someone addicted to the delights of this food, you don't care how it arrives! Thank you to all the staff here that helped us package this! You are truly the real heroes!   Also, In-N-Out, GO OPEN A RESTAURANT IN SEATTLE!! Love, your faithful desperate customers"}
{"text":"Obviously you can't go wrong with In-N-Out probably the greatest fast food burger. But it's doesn't deserve a five star because of the workers up front. Most of the time I always get the same Hispanic guy. He sits there with this face showing you he doesn't wanna work. Yeah in n out gets busy but they get paid good and everything is simple and ready to go and he works the cash register so I don't get why he's always mad. But he's mad and doesn't ask you how your day is or anything. If you're getting paid good just being a cash register at least speak up and see how your customers are doing."}
{"text":"This In-In-Out is awesome, their French Fries are as fresh as they say, as well as, their burgers. Drive thru was quick, easy, and great service."}
{"text":"This location of In N Out is definitely the mack daddy of them all in my experience. The wife and I have been here too many times to count it seems. It's always busy and I mean always busy, no matter the time of day. The only exception that I have seen is Thanksgiving day, because they are closed. Don't worry, I got over it and went the next day.  The wife is on a no meat kick, so she tried their grilled cheese. Basically it's a no meat burger prepared how you like with your favorite toppings. She also got a side of fries. I get my usual 2 double doubles animal style hold the tomato and lettuce. Don't get me wrong, I like lettuce and tomato, they just get in the way and make things messy. So no lettuce and tomato means problem solved. And the customary neopolitan shake was my drink to wash down my burger goodness.   It was a great way to end another great day in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"When it comes to fast food, it truly doesn't get any better than this!  Friendly, efficient employees, fresh ingredients, clean stores...and, oh yeah, the DELICIOUS food!  Go for an animal style burger and a chocolate shake--I promise you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So freaking good. Secret menu! Everything is made to order. I wish this amazing fast food restaurant existed back east."}
{"text":"Went to the Tropicana In&Out, havent been to this location in years. Order the #2 w/fries to take out n eat in my a/c car bcz I had my doggie w/me. The Hamburger was good but...the fries that are usually very good were cold, hard the bottom had over cooked petrified fries..they were disgusting.. The coke..yes the coke was horrible..too much syrup, it had a bit of carbonation it seem syrupy n flat. It was like drinking sugar..yuk! Went inside to let them no about my disgusting fries spoke to d manager (who was very nice) abt d state of my disgusting fries as a older spanish women standing behind him glared at me as if I was lying..I did get a fresh batch which were good..lik I'm use to getting, plump, soft fries..As for the syrupy coke I didn't mention it bcz I won't b going to this location ever again.."}
{"text":"Hate to give my once all time favorite burger place2stars .. When I moved here from NYC in '94 it's when I first got to enjoy In&Out burger n it was WOW! I cldnt believe how flavorful n yummy this burger was.. I kept going back through thru out d years. After not going a few month I went to this location recently.. Order my usual #2 w/grill onions sat dwn in a booth to enjoy my burger n fries after a few bites I notice d meat patty was almost paper thin.. Once done I said to my friend.. \"What's wrong with this burger beside that it's even thinner then before..the burger has no taste at all!\" Just a greasy taste n there's  no favor at all..the grill taste is gone also d fries had no taste either.. I never had d double, double always thought it wld b too much meat. But..after eating d paper thin #2 I wld need to order d #1..but..sadly that's it for me. My love affair w/In&OutBurger is over n done..it's not d sameplus d prices are up a bit.. which is fine bcz it's still cheap for a fresh burger&fries but.. I don't want to eat  just a greasy tasteless burger..nope!! Goodbye In&Out"}
{"text":"What do I even need to write. It's In-N-Out. The best west coast burger joint there is. Just got back from Texas on spring break and my brother said whataburger was way better, I was reassured by this that the west coast wins by far."}
{"text":"Animal style fries animal style double or 2 X 2 its such a wicked good place and a great example of focus...  they perfected their burgers and the line is always out the door.  perfect burger in my view and a taste like no other.  5.0"}
{"text":"double double with cheese animal style= food coma= 5 stars=heavenly=5 stars on yelp"}
{"text":"1.  Rent a car.  2.  Drive here.  3.  Eat for cheap.  4.  Go back to hotel.    Repeat steps 2 to 4 if you're a tourist, until you have to leave Vegas.  Otherwise, you're just lucky you can come to In-N-Out anytime!"}
{"text":"The enormously loud and garish sign at the highway will beckon me in my dreams from this day forward. My life has always been lived east of the Mississippi, and for whatever reason, my travels have never led me to an In-N-Out.   Everything they say is true. My personal home run was the Double Double Animal Style, and Well Done Fries Animal. Do not be afraid of the \"unwritten menu\" lingo thing. Step into this modern era and look it up on their company website or wikipedia...3x3, 4x4, Mucho Grande, Flying Dutchman, whatever, take charge of your life!    Next door is one of only two company stores in the nation, with t-shirts and other gear. Naturally, I now have a shirt and a set of fridge magnets, and a desire to petition the company daily to open an outpost here in Providence RI."}
{"text":"I've been an East Coast girl my whole life and never heard of In-N-Out Burger until I was in college.  I went here on a random Tuesday afternoon in March.  This location was packed worse than a NYC subway; however, I was able to place and get my order quickly.  Loved the Animal Style fries, even though that is probably one of the most unhealthy things there (cheese sauce, Thousand Island dressing mixture and diced grilled onions).  Please expand to the East Coast!"}
{"text":"Yes yes in-n-out burger is the best. I always love traveling to a location that has one.  A must stop. Double double fries and shake"}
{"text":"My first time here i was so excited to try it and it is definitely worth the try!! I'm not a fast food fan but i would say that among the fast food chains in n put is definitely a distinguished one."}
{"text":"Nice special sauce on the burgers.  Simple menu which we liked.  Did not like grilled bun (personal preference).  Loved that we could eat outside.  Great value we thought.  Busy place so everyone likes it!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best fast food burger in the west!  Everything is fresh fresh fresh, service is fast fast fast, and prices are cheap cheap cheap!   The fries actually taste like a potato was used in the process and they are to die for.  And the best damn burgers you can find without leaving your car. I've been an In-N-Out fan for almost 30 years and have yet to find a better burger deal or a better burger from my car.   Other reviewers have my interest piqued regarding their secret menu and animal style fries ... So I'm off to Google INO and delve further."}
{"text":"Fresh, reminds me of Johnny Rockets.  Nothing spectacular but definitely good food for low prices."}
{"text":"The hamburger is cheap and good, just a few options, and always a long line but it doesn't take long to get your burger! I came here sometimes for some burgers with my family and average $2.60 for single size of burger and $3.20 for double size, if for me sometimes stop by for a burger! I truly recommended!"}
{"text":"Somehow whenever I eat at In-N-Out it always feels special whether it's a quick bite during my lunch break or the first stop of an exciting road trip.  For me, In-N-Oout has nostalgia and brings me back to ordering it as a kid.  As a vegetarian, my go to is the Grilled Cheese ($2.30) off their not so secret menu and when I'm feeling healthy it is the Grilled Cheese, Protein Style.  The grilled cheese is not just cheese and buns but everything on a cheeseburger except the meat including secret sauce, tomatoes, lettuce, and fresh or grilled onions.  The cheese is melty with caramelized edges and the bun is soft and grilled to crisp on one side. The veggies are cool and fresh and together makes such a delicious meal.   My husband orders the Double Double with Fried Mustard and Chopped Chilies.  This is a double meat and double cheese burger with the mustard grilled into the meat and green chilis chopped and pressed into the bun.  $2-3 for a burger of this quality is one of the big reasons why the chain has created a cult following. It has become the gold standard of burger for my husband and I and commonly find ourselves asking each other how other burgers compare in taste and price to In-N-Out."}
{"text":"If you have the In and Out urge by Henderson, this is it! Stop by.  Got here early just before lunch. Just a great meal like always. Standard cheese burger with Animal style fries and Lemonade. Hits the spot.   Surprisingly short wait in line today. Cashier and everyone is more energetic than any other fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"I introduced my friend to the wonders of In-N-Out today and felt the need to Yelp about it.  Their hamburgers are works of art.  Would I love some more toppings like bacon or guacamole or fried onions?  Maybe, but there is so much taste happening in the simplicity of the In-N-Out Double Double.    The best part is you can wolf down a burger and fries and not feel like you just swallowed a rock, the feeling exhibited when you go to almost any other burger fast food joint.  And always, ask for it Animal Style."}
{"text":"How can u go wrong with an in n out burger! Besides the lines in the drive through I've never had a complaint. I'm trying to figure out where they get the young ppl that work for these stores from bc they are always super accommodating and polite which I find isn't very common for a fast food joint. We don't make a habit out of Eating here, 2-3 times max a year but when we do it is a treat. Vanilla shakes are amazing, pink lemonade is awesome(pretty tart though) and the classic simpleness of the burger and fries can't be beat!"}
{"text":"It's 1120 am, one car in front of me... 20+ minute wait? Handed me my food and didn't ask for money? They didn't even know if I got my soda? Talk about unorganized."}
{"text":"This place is always packed, but the service is quick and friendly. Well trained employees, always working hard, always get the order right... great food for a great price! This is how it's done!  Ask for the little chilis on the side, or on your burger if you like a little spice, very good! The fries are fresh, the only annoying thing is the slicer they use is pretty loud... but fresh fries, that's a small price to pay!  Well, if you haven't tried this place, what are you waiting for? Surely this review is just another 5 star review for In n Out Burger... go there now!"}
{"text":"Food good- always busy and no parking- plan to wait there is nothing fast about this food"}
{"text":"We have eaten at many In-N-Out Burgers and this one was exceptionally good!  We went in on a busy Friday night and our sandwiches were amazing.  I usually am not a huge fan of their fries but the fries we got here were actually really good! I would highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Sooooo I officially give up on this place. The food is always cold. Dine in or carry out, it doesn't matter. It's cold."}
{"text":"My first time having Animal Fries. They have melted cheese, thousand island dressing and grilled onions on top. #Amazing. I will be coming here all the time from now on. I am officially hooked. These fries are addicting! I can't wait to try something else on the menu. My first experience with In & Out is a great one. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Ahh, In n Out on campus is DANGEROUS!! Hahaha. I would be walking to class and be smelling In n Out in the air trying to tempt me to have that for my lunch/dinner. I've learned to resist (thankfully). ANYWAY, don't get me wrong it is awesome to have an In n Out here right by UNLV. It's a great option when you don't want any of the food offered in the Student Union. You can never go wrong with in in out. They are always consistent no matter how busy they can get, you can always count on great service and fresh yummy burgers & fries :-)"}
{"text":"So don't feel too sorry for me, but I'm 45 years old and today was my first ever experience at In-N-Out. I was craving a burger and am new to the area. I was very impressed by the staff - every single person was smiling and hustling. I ordered a #2 and had my first root beer in about 10 years. I'm pretty sure my eyes rolled back in my head when I took my first bite of the burger. Despite not being a big fan of \"white buns\", I didn't even care because the burger was so delicious. Next time I will try animal style. I read a lot of comments about the fries being bland or boring. I think they tasted like fries without any added \"food-like products.\" I think many palates are so accustomed to overly seasoned and salted foods, they've forgotten what real food actually tastes like. The fries are made of potatoes and that's what they taste like. Boom. In-N-Out is my new guilty pleasure for a fast, reasonable and delicious burger."}
{"text":"I haven't had In-n-out in months! Delishious. I'm still convinced that 1 guy here can kill 5 guys from that other place. It smashes the other competition too! Two words: Animal Style!"}
{"text":"This is consistently one of their best locations and I have been to many of them. Food and Service always rate above the rest. These are not gourmet burgers. Simple menu with fresh ingredients and quick service for a great value. There is a top secret menu that you can Google for some fun options.  There is one associate named LUZ who is my favorite and makes this a 5 STAR experience. When she is there she always greets you and helps you get seated while making sure everything is perfect in the dinning area. Her smile, grace and enthusiasm makes me want to come back again and again. Thumbs up!  I normally like to order the 3X3 or the 4X4 with everything then add pickle plus an order of fries with a couple sides of spread. Sometimes I bring some of my home grown Chiltepin Peppers to add some kick. Can get really busy during peak hours. Shares the same parking lot as Sprout's. Just smell for the aroma of grilled onions and beef in the air. Hard to resist."}
{"text":"My favorite hamburger. I can have a 4x4 in there and still want more the next day. Should there be one next to me I'd totally get fat.  Also, super BUSY location, but better than the one on Fort Apache in Summerlin - this one is DIRTY."}
{"text":"Love In-N-Out. This location was packed, but the food still can put pretty quick. Love the Animal Style Fries, pretty sure they are not on the menu but if you ask, they will deliver!"}
{"text":"I went to Vegas and wanted a quick burger before going back to my hotel. I honestly never heard of this place before and saw that it was close by. I am so glad I stumbled upon it. I loved the burger and the fries, they were so tasty. I wish we had one here in my hometown!"}
{"text":"I hate going with the flow of what is popular, but they are great. Service is quick, food delicious. The only thing there is not enough seating inside.  We sat outside in the blazing 115 degree weather. I have never scarfed down my animal style burger so fast. I guess it was a combo of the deliciousness and the heat."}
{"text":"This was one of the first things I made sure to do when getting off the plane and checking into my hotel when I realized this wasn't too far away from the Excalibur. That being said I've never been to Vegas so I walked there. Walking on the highway hilarity ensued. This was my first In-N-Out experience, and man was this a bang for the buck. Very tasty, very fairly priced, got the animal fries, a Neapolitan shake and a double burger. Why not the 5 stars? Well I'm sure that there is a shining star of a location out there that I haven't seen yet. Cleanliness wasn't too great but that's understandable due to the large crowds I guess."}
{"text":"What is it about In-N-Out that I'm not getting? I just don't get what the big deal is. This is the closest In-N-Out to my house and, thus, I've tried it a few times. And every time, I'm left almost totally unsatisfied.  The burger itself is just so unappealing to me. It's primarily all produce. The actual burger is no bigger than what you get at McDonald's. And my burger always seems to have a weird crunch to it. And personally, I don't like my burgers to crunch when I bite into them.  What I do like is the animal-style fries. But I can never quite finish them as the fries always seem to be too overdone at this location.  The ability to have a choco-vanilla milkshake, however, will always be appealing to me. In fact, I think it is the milkshakes that I like the best.  So yeah, I just don't get it. I guess I'm just not an In-N-Out gal."}
{"text":"I'm from the East Coast, so I make it a point to go to In-n-Out Burger when I'm out west. It's always as good as I remember. The Double-Double is clearly the way to go and get your fries Animal Style. Fresh veggies, good meat, good buns and sauce. I'd say my fries were a little sub-par tonight, but still good. The staff was completely hustling and working hard. I'd love to see In-n-Out on the East Coast, but I know it wouldn't be the same. Love In-N-Out!"}
{"text":"So I love in n out, who doesn't?  But this one seems to just take a really long time to get you through the drive thru!"}
{"text":"This location killed In-N-Out Burger for me. I don't know what it was, but the burgers and especially the fries were the worst I've had at one of these chains. Was sad, because I was bringing my boyfriend to In-N-Out for the first time and I had to admit that it wasn't very good.  To be specific.... the fries were limp and greasy and the burger was over-saturated and just not good eating overall."}
{"text":"The staff is extremely kind, hardworking and always make me feel welcome in the restaurant. The food has always fresh, made to order, hot and delicious. I come to this location pretty often and I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food. Service can be slow with the volume of customers they get."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the best hamburger on the planet.  I live for In-N-Out Burger when I head West and I was impressed by the friendliness of the staff and speed with which my order was processed during a busy Thursday evening.  I'd give this location 5 stars (and if I were rating the burger and service alone, it's no contest), but I was disappointed by the fries.  They didn't taste as fresh as usual.  That said, they weren't stale or frozen, so they beat every other fast food chain.  I'd certainly go back since my Double Double without, with pickles, sliced chilis, and extra spread was AMAZING.  Be aware: they do not accept American Express, but Visa and Mastercard are just fine."}
{"text":"I can see the appeal of this place, but honestly, I've had better. All my friends (from the west coast) have raved about this place, so I decided to give it a try. I come from Texas, the home of What-A-Burger. If you go to Texas and eat there, you'll understand why I say that the burgers at In N Out are small, and the fries are tasteless. In addition, I was starving and had to wait a long time for a small burger, and after ordering said burger, I was forced to fight for a table. Not. Worth.It.   I don't think anyone is wrong for liking this place, but I really don't think it's for me.   p.s. to the person who said he got sick from this location, I think I might have gotten ill too. I ate there on a friday, and I dealt with a sore throat and nausea for the next two days. However, I'm not sure if it was the In N Out that did that. Vegas is filled with tourists, some of them bringing all kinds of sicknesses. They don't clean the slot machines. Remember that."}
{"text":"A good idea, when you are looking for something quick and want to fill your stomach, but otherwise it's just a bad burger that will make you feel really bad when you finish it. I will Never ever going back there."}
{"text":"When I visited in and out in AZ I thought it will be terrible but it was really really really really really great I had a cheeseburger with fries and it was the best cheeseburger ever. All U Guys she go to In and and out"}
{"text":"The fact that I haven't eaten meat in a few weeks wasn't holding me back from having me some In-N-Out! The grilled cheese animal style is so good you will forget you didn't order the meat. Try it next time your there. I had to take a star off because it always takes forever to get your food."}
{"text":"Decent spot as there aren't any in New England but burger was bland and French fries weren't crispy. Small menu with only 3 burger options."}
{"text":"I normally don't do reviews of chains, but I felt this one deserved a review. One of the best burgers I've had from a fast food restaurant...hands down.  Very simple menu, order your burger, fries, and shake. I went with animal style on the burger which added some extra toppings and sauce. Highly recommend this.  This place is great for a quick lunch stop or when you're slumming for some food because you're drunk!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend had been waiting a long time to go here and he said the birders were just average. I had the fries and they were good."}
{"text":"The workers here are always so polite and always give great customer service. My order is always right and my food always tastes great! When other places mess up my order or give terrible service, I go here to basically guarantee my order will be right. I wish other places were as great as this in n out."}
{"text":"The people that work here have the worst sanitary habits ever. This is not my first visit but I'm freaking tired of it! I've let the manager know, I've called corporate, and the bags and boxes given at this location are DISGUSTING! Maybe this will get someone's attention and do something about it."}
{"text":"When I crave for a hamburger this is the joint!  You can get hamburger protein style if you don't want all the carbs.  I love it when they grill the onions but you have to specify it.  This place is way better than 5 guys (no offense, but true).  The strawberry milkshake is very delicious as well and it's at great loc by the freeway!"}
{"text":"***TIPS***  - This is the closest location to the main vegas strip - Don't come between 10pm to midnight, you might have to wait 30 minutes for your food. Its faster to do drive through during these hours. - Go after midnight if eating there."}
{"text":"In-N-Out. IN through my mouth and OUT through \"making toilet\" as Borat Sagdiyev would say. It's the 2nd best In-N-Out I've ever been to, second to the one in Atascadero, CA off of Route 101. Ordering off the secret menu is key and I had the 3x3 done Animal Style with fries and a strawberry shake. Nice job guys - the patties, meat and toppings were perfectly placed, the cheese was perfectly melted and oozing and it was put together perfectly. The wax paper allowed for the burger to maintain its integrity and because of this, you are a solid 4.5 Yelps although Yelp will not allow me to do this. You get 5 Yelps for being the 2nd best rounded up.  THIS has been a review by Gaurav"}
{"text":"While living up in the PNW of Washington I would see these tee-shirts and bumper stickers for the In n Out Burger joints and wonder what I was missing. So I come to AZ and I see them all over. One day (months ago) I try one. Hmmm I haven't missed a darn thing is my conclusion. It hasn't grown on me. I've not been tempted to return. I've been repelled to avoid it is more like what happened. All desire to experience it again was removed by one visit to this lame enterprise. Nothing is cool about it, fun about it, or great. I love burgers and fries, can eat them three or more times a week if I allowed myself, however this place doesn't do the great American meal any justice, sorry they could fold up and close their doors without making a blip on any radar screen of dining experience."}
{"text":"Food is excellent like ALWAYS, however this is a busy location and sometimes the waiting can be a little overbearing."}
{"text":"Love the fact that you can get filled up at one of these Burger joints and not let it break the bank. The food is always freshly made and the service is very friendly.  This particular location is in the Fiesta Mall parking lot and it can get pretty busy during peak hours. Usually get here before the lunch rush and eat quickly so I can get back to work in a hurry.  3X3 with Onions, add Pickles and Chili Peppers, please. Sometime I'll treat myself to an order of their tasty and freshly sliced French Fries. Definitely can't resist a giant pile of the spicy complementary Chili Peppers. Oh Yeah!  They have several ways that you can order your burger here. Just do a quick google for their Top Secret ordering instruction and you will be amazed. Animal style is a typical favorite and you will probably see a few during your visit.  See ya there next time and remember to enjoy the moment. Life is Good. SAY CHEESE!  3.75 STARS"}
{"text":"Went grocery shopping and naturally didn't feel like going home to cook. Saw this place for probably the hundredth time finally decided to give it a try. It was pretty good actually, the fries were fresh burger was juicy. Just got the regular cheeseburger, some fries, and a coke. It's all about the sauce at this place. There was definitely an old school diner vibe, the atmosphere around the place was definitely classic. They were quick for the drive thru and the attendants were cheery. I look forward to going inside next time."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to In-N-Out Burger and it was great.  My wife and I arrived at a time where there was a gap in the rush on this place. Good thing, too, because it filled up in a  matter of 5 minutes after we parked. We were fortunate to snag a seat inside.  The young lady at the register was incredibly nice. I really liked her. I was even more fond of her because she helped to facilitate my first transaction with this icon of bovine via bun-deliverance system.  My wife wasn't aware of the secret menu when we ordered, but it was irrelevant. We both ordered a Double Double w/ Onion, fries, me a drink from the poison fountain (soda) and she had a vanilla shake. Everything was to our liking and hit the spot.   Well played, In-N-Out Burger. You won us over. Please come to the 4 corners area soon."}
{"text":"A must stop (or drive thru) whenever we hit LV! Best burger around!"}
{"text":"I can't say this one is any better than the other 100 they have on this side of the world, but they just don't have them on the east coast.  In-N-Out Burger is great.  Amazing burgers and fries.  Make sure you ask for animal style and they put all kinds of wackiness on it."}
{"text":"As an Oregonian, I had yet to experience the wonder of In-N-Out Burger until 2 weeks ago, when I went down there for the classic car auctions. Let me tell you, the food was worthy of the hype it gets. Now I know I might get killed for saying this, but I got mine without the sauce. I'm not a big mayo or secret sauce fan, so there. But, I did get one animal style, and it was amazing. One key to the great taste is they grill their buns. Another is that their menu is simple, and they don't deviate from the best tasting menu items.   The only problem I have with this place is their T-Shirts. They have a Barracuda on it with a 389 emblem on it. WTF is that about!? That made me mad, because no Barracuda has a 389 in it, let alone an emblem on the side. Minor gripe, and not enough to take it down a point. Definitely check this place out if you are in AZ. It is everything it was built up to be."}
{"text":"I was actually nervous about eating at the In and Out burger 'cause I felt as though I was cheating on our LA tradition. I really wanted something good and cheap as I knew that it was going to be a long time before dinner. It was well worth the hour wait from in line, paying and getting the food. Of course with any other location finding a seat is a challenge. I would have more luck winning money at the slots than actually finding a seat the first time. Eventually we realized that this wasn't anti social Vancouver and that most people given the seating circumstance would be happy to share a seat with us. We found a seat with this lovely couple. Again seat sharing isn't a thing in Vancouver so we were shocked as someone actually welcomed us to their seat. I didn't do animal style this time. I just got two basic burgers and fries to share. I am happy to report that the taste is just like the location in LA. I ate that burger slowly with my eyes closed. I didn't even talk to my best friend. I just wanted the moment to myself. I picked up a pair of In and Out Milk Shake socks on the way out since I collect cool socks."}
{"text":"What can you say... it's in n out burger  .. it's the bomb. Get your fries animal style. Don't get anything less than a double double. If you do you will be disappointed. Also, at this location you will wait a lil but but it's so worth it."}
{"text":"Had it years ago but not as good as I use to remember... had the double patty animal style and a order of cheese fries.  It was another good experience but hey still looking for that great burger."}
{"text":"I have been a long time customer since my childhood days, the service is always friendly and upbeat. Not to mention the delicious burgers and fries. They are open until 1am which makes it fantastic when you're awake at night and feel the need to grab and a double double to go. Every experience I've had is satisfying, I always bring my family to eat here, especially my aunt from Texas who is bewitched by their animal fries. In N Out has a special place in my heart, to remind me of the good times and the great tasty food. Will never get enough of it."}
{"text":"This is great fast food......it is a must try when out in this area.....simple menu....excellent burgers and fries.....there is only three registers where you place your order I was #67.....they were only on #35.......the lines get even crazier.....it was worth it...people are eating all over the place chowing down......a must try for the nit so quick fast food.  De lic ous........"}
{"text":"Holy balls. In N Out does NOT disappoint! This was my first time at In N Out and it was so good we came here twice on our 4-day trip in Arizona.  Double Double Animal style is the way to go. It is the perfect mix of a study yet not too hard bun, tons of crunch lettuce/tomato/pickles, grilled onions are so tasty and the mix of the cheese and spread are SO GOOD.  Definitely a must try!!"}
{"text":"After a day at the Grand Canyon, we wanted something quick and easy so we could just go back to our hotel room and chill (bath/wine/TV). We had seen the sign for In-N-Out on the way in to our hotel and my GF had never had before so we decided to try and make the trek by foot, which turned out to be an adventure on its own. This location is not exactly easy to get to from the Strip, especially if you don't know how to go. We started out on the North side of Tropicana Ave. only to get jammed up in the NY, NY/ Monte Carlo parking garage area. We headed back up and started down the North side of the freeway underpass only to get blocked again by more highways. Crossed under the freeway and lo and behold found the path which would lead us back up over the freeway and across to Dean Martin Blvd.. 5 more crosswalks and we made it! That desert oasis in a sea of overpriced mediocrity. Our reward?: a double-double (animal-style), a single cheeseburger, fries and two X-Large sodas. And the girl even got herself a paper hat. Winning!"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch to check out the hype and following of this place.   The place has a constant flow of customers and they served two hundred orders the thirty minutes I was there.   The burgers are good for a fast food burger, I got double double animal style burger with fries. The burger is great for fast food, but I wouldn't try eating that in a car.   The fries were just OK.   The chocolate shake was excellent, thick and delicious.   I like the fact that it is family owned and that they pay the workers more than minimum wage makes this a great choice."}
{"text":"\"In and out ..,,in and out ...,that's what I hamburgers all about\" And out has the best hamburgers. Animal style is delicious. my kids love it because they give them fun hats and stickers. I love the prices and the fact that they don't go up over the years. I definitely give this place two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I'm a Cali girl, so In N Out will always have a place in my heart. But when you come to a city like Las Vegas, you just have certain expectations. Like that if you want In N Out at 5am in the morning, is it too much to ask that you be open in the city that never sleeps? Oh wait, is that New York? Well, you know what I mean.  Anyway, this place still closes at 1am, to all of our disappointment. So we decided to eat here for brunch the next morning before our drive back home.   The ginormous neon sign off the freeway isn't hard to miss. However, I am confused that the size of this location is just like any other In N Out I've been to. The line was almost literally out the door. They are obviously busy, why not make the place bigger? It was interesting to hear people in line talk about the secret menu to their friends. Being a Californian, it's funny to think we know things others don't, like we're special or something. People ordering quadruple-stacks and animal-style fries - it gave me a new appreciation for the joint.   It's not the best burger I've had in my lifetime, but I would have to say it is pretty darn tasty. I myself enjoy the toasted bun and the grilled onions. There was one point in my life where I would solely eat the animal-style fries for lunch for quite a few months (that's french fries with the 1000-island-like spread, melted cheese and grilled onions). And let me tell you, I was concerned for my health and had to eventually quit.   So although I do not frequent this place too often nowadays, I realize now that I'm not sure I would like to live without it. I have heard too many a story of people who move to different states and miss the taste of an In N Out burger...and now I truly understand.   Just be open 24 hours a day in Vegas. You are missing out on profit from post-party patrons. It just makes sense, don't you think?"}
{"text":"Tasty burgers.  Fries were not hot but still worth it.  There were plenty of folks in line when we got there yet you didn't feel \"forgotten\" since the line moved well.  Tables were clean and they had several staff members picking up in the dining room so all hands were literally on deck both behind the counter and amongst the customers.  Just before we left a tour bus pulled up and rushed the entryway.  Despite obviously seeing the parking lot virtually full upon arrival and the dining room packed they decided to line up at the counter anyway.  So, looks like the In-N-Out Burger franchise is humming along just fine.  Have been at other In-N-Outs in NV and CA so my 4 star rating is quite accurate.  P.S.  I believe they cut potatoes for the fires fresh in the back area...cool."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a Celiac friendly spot and In 'N' Out is a Go-To. They provide the alternatives my son and I need without sacrificing flavor and my cravings! Can you say Protein - style Double Double with Animal style fries? Hello! Thank you. Consistently great customer service and quality food."}
{"text":"Just a classic burger joint done right."}
{"text":"I secretly moved back to this area of the country strictly for the In-N-Out Burger factor.. Nothing anywhere compares to it. In fact, after my last visit I was reminded how perfectly delicious it is and I am changing my last meal on earth to an animal style burger, well done fries and a Neapolitan milkshake. It really is the American dream.  I am always fascinated when I walk into any on of their establishments. Always clean yet so disorderly.. The lines are always retarded long, and there are always people standing everywhere, but somehow they never fail to deliver every meal hot, fresh, delicious and FAST. I have NEVER encountered a broken ATM inside either.  Not everyone is aware of their \"secret menu\", with items such as the 2x4, flying Dutchman, the protein style burger and my fave, animal style... In fact, the secret items actually outnumber the items legitimately on the menu which only consists of a Hamburger, Cheeseburger, Double-Double, French Fries, Coca-Cola products and three shakes: chocolate, vanilla and strawberry, of course. I'm pretty sure you can download a PDF of their menu somewhere online, but even if you don't know the terms, the employees at In-N-Out will pretty much do anything to a burger if you ask them.. I also recommend the fries well done.. otherwise they are kind of soggy.   Now I am hungry, I think I've decided whats for lunch!"}
{"text":"DOUBLE DOUBLE ANIMAL STYLE!!! The store is really clean, service was friendly, and food delicious. Parking lot is a bit confusing, but who cares it is so worth it.  One thing though, the fries animal style were a bit too over-cheesed for me and I felt gross after having the already rich burger, although that didn't stop me from finishing everything.  Can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"We drove through this In-n-Out burger for tonight's dinner. They got our order right for the most part, but my wife asked for extra lemons on the side for her iced tea. We got the lemons on the side all right, but we also found three lemons in the tea as well. If we had wanted the lemon in the tea, we would have asked for it in the tea and not on the side. Also, my daughter's Coca-Cola didn't taste like Coke, it tasted like three or four different soft drinks put together. They are often good and we are glad there is somewhere that is open as late as it is. But they make a lot of mistakes they ought to avoid."}
{"text":"Oh, I love thee In-N-Out. Unfortunately, long distance isn't working very well for us. I'm head over heels smitten, but you refuse to make the move for me. I need you in the Midwest. Need. Yet, while we are apart, our passion only grows. . Double Double with Cheese, Animal Style. Animal Style Fries. Vanilla shake. Be still my heart. Fin."}
{"text":"I'm such an In-and-Out fan. Anytime I'm in a city with In-and-Out I have to get my fix on animal style fries. The only bad thing I would say about this location is that it is quite small to be so close to the strip. I would think the dinning room should be larger and the outdoor patio area could use more than three tables. I knew it would be hard to find a seat for 5 women but we had to split the group up on completly different sides of the restaurant to eat our meal. Did I mention we went at 9pm and the place was still super busy?"}
{"text":"Great customer service here EVERY time! I'll take the #1 with animal fries, yum!"}
{"text":"Should not be a 15 minute ordeal to go through drive thru. Takes them forever to get the food out!"}
{"text":"Super easy menu, great staff and amazing food. Great prices, speedy service; super busy but very much worth the wait."}
{"text":"All I have to say is awesome burgers and staff but they need to update their plans for the drive threw. Lines are always too long."}
{"text":"As good as I remembered, very busy,fast service, friendly staff. The only thing, and his minor I wish they had malts instead of shakes."}
{"text":"My 21 year old grandson who lives with my wife & I along with My 14 year old grandson who spent the night while my wife is in the hospital for a knee replacement. After leaving the hospital around 7pm we stopped at In-N-Out Burger for a quick dinner. I normally detest fast food, but I don't even think In-N-Out truly belongs in that category.  A lot of people would say In-N-Out is overrated but they are good. They have a very limited menu of get a load of this, all they have is burgers, fries and a few beverages to wash them down.    FOOD: Cooked fresh, our burgers came out hot. They weren't sitting under a heat lamp like some places. It's fast food that's WAY better than any other options out there. For a fast food burger the flavor can't be beat. FYI: I'm NOT a fan of their fries. PRICE: reasonable price. SERVICE: The service was fast and they were really nice. CONCLUSION: I don't know what the secret  is.  Chances are you can make a better burger at home, but at the same time there is just something about In-N-Out burgers that makes them  delicious. Everything was cooked to perfection! This In N Out is on it! They're at the top of their game to handle soooooooooooo many people and still produce such top notch food!"}
{"text":"What can you say - IT IS In-N-Out!  This place has always had great customer service and food.  The lines can get long at this location, but it is because of the busy area.    Double, double protein style please!"}
{"text":"Best burger we've had in a while at craigs road. We had animal style double-doubles and animal style mmm"}
{"text":"http://www.in-n-out.com/secretmenu.asp http://www.badmouth.net/in-n-outs-secret-menu/  Double Double Animal Style.  It is worth the trip cross country.  Well maybe not, but I do enjoy them while I am visiting.  I cannot get enough of them.  If you are really hungry: http://www.texasburgerguy.com/2005/01/16-x-tra-patties-and-x-tra-cheeses.html  The private stalled restrooms are always spotless and stocked.  4 Flushes."}
{"text":"Double Double Animal Style.  Love it.  4 things ons the menu, it is not about selection, it is about quality, and I really appreciate it.  And generally house my meal.  As usual the place is clean everywhere, people working here like working here, and the food is cooked and served quickly.  Everything is fresh.  The restrooms are ridiculously clean for a fast food joint, private stalls, stocked and checked regularly.  4.25 Flushes.  p.s. The combo menus do not save you any money, they just make it easier to order."}
{"text":"I love me some In N Out Burger!!!!  This is a must every time I hit the west coast because we lack this food chain in Illinois.  You can't go wrong with this place...it's simple, burgers, fries, drinks, & shakes.  I absolutely LOVE the fries from this place!!!  Skip McDonalds and those other food chains... this is higher quality fast food that you won't regret.  Oh, if you're skipping out on the carbs/bread - you can get your burger wrapped in lettuce tooo!"}
{"text":"It's been years.. really.  Double-double animal style is a classic and to deviate from such is a sin to the burger gods.  Animal style fries just seems over the top.. But we ordered that too.  Wash it down with a strawberry shake and life is good after 18 holes at Wolf Creek.  Til next time."}
{"text":"Every location rocks! The only dislike with this one is the drive thru is kind of cattywompus and hard to navigate. Plus, when you go back to the street, people hold up traffic making prohibited left turns!! Frustrating based on location and ignorance of Las Vegas drivers."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their burgers and fries. I was first introduced to In-N-Out in Los Angeles, and am glad to be able to indulge in their food in Las Vegas. This is one of my favorite drive through meals."}
{"text":"One yuppie somehow got the notion that In N Out Burger was cool. He/she convinced two more yuppies this was true. Now every yuppie in town believes it is cool to say In N Out Burger is good.   Truth be told , it is average."}
{"text":"I really don't understand what the big deal is about this place. The burgers are decent for a fast food restaurant, but nothing to write home about.   Perhaps In-N-Out Burger is better in other states or something.   To me it was a step up from McDonald's and a step down from 5 & Diner."}
{"text":"Great experience here, as usual. I'm a huge fan of the company and love their emphasis on employee efficiency and appreciation. This location is no exception.  Went on a Sunday afternoon and as expected, it was crowded- outside parking looked like it would be a hassle but someone backed out right in front of us and we got to take their spot. Inside, lines were organized and not too long and it was easy to snag one of the few available tables. Order came out pretty quick, and once we finished there weren't so many people waiting around that we felt rushed out.   Food was hot, fresh, and delicious, as usual. Got the #2, animal style burger and fries, and made a hot mess of myself. Maybe it's because this place is such a rare treat for me, but I didn't really see the appeal of their regular plain fries- I've heard a couple of people rave about them, but aside from the animal style extras, they're just fries, guys."}
{"text":"In n out was my first hs job and even after working there for a year, I never got sick of their food nor was I disgusted because I was actually part of the process of making the food. Lettuce, tomatoes, onions are cut fresh daily. Cleanliness is always on point with checks and protocols. And food is cooked from raw to cooked on a grill fresh, no microwaves or heat lamps. I grew up eating this burger. I moved up to this side of town 2 years ago and was actually disappointed with this store, lettuce was skimpy, fries were soggy, buns weren't really toasted had a few wrong orders, BUT they have stepped up their game this year and back to the standard I expect. Yes, the drive thru can be a little long, but this isn't McDonald's yall!"}
{"text":"Affordable, tasty food with great customer service! My first time at In-N-Out Burger was aiight. *sniff*  Cheeseburger, animal style fries, and a pink lemonade are a great combo for $8!"}
{"text":"This particular In-N-Out location is a decent one. Clean on the inside. Orders are always correct. Never too busy or too crowded.  Now, I'm not all that into the burgers at In-N-Out. I know, blasphemy! But whatever. I personally do not care for them. They're not bad by any means, but I don't think they're all that good either.  What I do LOVE and crave here are the animal-style fries. Say what? Just say yes. Get your fries animal-style. They are delicious and oh-so-craveworthy.  Yum yum yum! I'm craving them just writing this."}
{"text":"if I can rate this no stars I would. me and a couple friends were going to grab some lunch before we head to Vegas. we order our usual that we normally get at a California in-n-out burger, but me and a friend got terrible food poisoning from eating here. we haven't been able to keep anything down for the last two days. do not eat here!!"}
{"text":"I didn't know they had an In-n-out in Arizona! I'm from Cali so I was surprised lol. This place like all in-n-outs was pretty crowded, but the employees were quick and very nice.   Secret Menu: -animal style fries -well done fries -neapolitan milkshake -whole grilled onions -can ask for no salt on burger patty -add chopped chilies to burger -more patties/more cheese -protein style burger  -grilled cheese sandwich -cheese fries"}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge #55/100  Whenever I visit the 9th Island I head on down to this In-N-Out Burger.  It is pretty busy as it's close to the strip, but if you go during off hour times such as before lunch or late afternoon, then it's not so bad.  Usually there is a wait at any In-N-Out I've been to but YMMV.  What I love to order here is the 4 X 4, anything animal style like the burgers and fries, and the neapolitan shake.  Can't forget that handmade milkshakes.  Just a bunch of yummy goodness.  Also, the fries are always freshly cut and made fresh to order.  Also, there is special sauce for the fries as well if requested.    I wish there was a In-N-Out in Hawaii, but knowing that won't happen (at least not any time soon), I'm going to make this a regular stop on the 9th island."}
{"text":"What can you say about a classic?  I like the cold crisp bite of lettuce & pickle with the warm tasty beef. No wonder the drive thru line wraps around the building. This location is quite fast though , around 1:30 I was in & out!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out, I never could find the charm or a real love for this place. I mean it's the \"classic\" twist on the burger and fries scene but at the end of the day, they really lack a flavor profile. It's very bland but on the plus side, is super cheap.   I've been at in and out multiple time but always find it to be a little bit of a let down due to lack of any real flavorful taste. The only good thing are the Animal style fries! They are delicious! The saving grace of this place, at least for me!"}
{"text":"Always a favorite spot! My parents from Missouri always make sure we go here when they visit!"}
{"text":"This is a love/hate relation inducing location. It is one of the busiest joints in town, so you can expect fresh, hot food done  quickly. However, if you go during the lunch rush or on a Soccer Saturday, you can often get the results of that rushing in the form of wrong items or overly crowded spaces.  I'm a fan, and like this location. I just smack my forehead in frustration when I time my visits poorly. Maybe it's a me problem, but there has to be some ease on the parking and traffic congestion. Regardless, because of location and consistency (at the right times) I will continue going here."}
{"text":"You haven't truly lived if you haven't tried In-N-Out!! This is only the best AND one of the cheapest fast food chains in the West Coast (in my opinion); much better than Five Guys."}
{"text":"YAS GAWD! I finally get to eat at In-N-Out and become a believer. It's fast, inexpensive, and deliciously made burgers and fries. You're literally In and Out!"}
{"text":"Drive thru lane is always packed. They go pretty quick. Like that you can see into the kitchen from the drive thru. Burgers are always good. Like the animal style fries."}
{"text":"Hard to believe this was my first time EVER at In n out. I'm not a huge burger guy, I usually order the chicken at fast food places. Right after I walked in, I knew there was something special about this burger place... The menu board was simple and focused... kinda like Five Guys. I ordered the single cheeseburger animal style with fries. OMG! With my first bite, I was in heaven! The perfectly toasted buns to the grilled onions and secret sauce, I had to slow down to make sure I enjoyed every bite! I washed it down with some strawberry lemonade! I cant wait to come back here more often and try other secret menu items! Think I'll try animal style fries and mustard grilled burgers, or maybe hot peppers added. The possibilities are endless!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly staff! Get the double double with only cheese. Just like a grilled cheese with some tasty patties. Trust me, it's better than a traditional cheese burger!"}
{"text":"Yes. In N Out is always honest and never duplicated.  Quality = Yum."}
{"text":"Always a good burger. No one else compares. Don't take my word for it. Look at the line to get in this place and look at all the happy faces eating out front by the fountain. The line moved quickly and the grilled onions always smell soooo good."}
{"text":"In and out is just In and Out.  It is not good it is not bad, it's just what it is. They are efficient,  friendly,  and serve a decent product.  You go expecting to have no variation in the simple and easy menu, and that is what you get and why you go."}
{"text":"This In-N-Out made me appreciate the ones back home so much. After long nights of pure partying, my friends and I came to this place two days in a row and it tasted better each time. The silent battles for a table in this madhouse made the experience even better. It was like a game within a challenge (to eat before you pass out). Damn, I love this place."}
{"text":"Best burger place for fast food. The employees are great and always friendly. Little known fact all of the employees are honor students."}
{"text":"I'm going to get so much hate for this review- but I simply do not see the hype over In-N-Out Burger. Their fries taste stale and their buns aren't too great either. I'll never understand the type of people who \"Have\" to have In-N-Out first thing when they step foot in the west coast.   That aside, I do acknowledge that they are consistent and serve quality ingredients. It's also nice that they have very fair priced meals - maybe even more affordable than McDonalds! It's not a bad burger by any means, just not the best as some people make them out to be.   It's also a convenient stop when you've been driving from restaurant to restaurant throughout Phoenix at 11 PM and everyone's kitchens are closed; like my experience tonight."}
{"text":"I would have eaten here more often, but long lines, long wait times, and nowhere to sit just really makes it absurd. I wonder how long it'll be before this place is so busy that nobody goes here anymore, but hey, it's vegas, people are used to being treated like the cattle they are in line to eat. ;-)"}
{"text":"No words needed ..... Simply the best burger for my tastebuds in the whole wide world :D"}
{"text":"I get a double double every time I come through this city."}
{"text":"Sooo busy. Glad America loves good burgers  and fries .  Expected more!  Burger seemed a little dry. Would of liked more sauce. Fries were good. Still like my Good Times in CO!"}
{"text":"I've been to other In-N-Out Burgers before; always had a great experience. This location is clean, fresh and the service is stellar. The prices are cheap but it seems like the hamburger patties are thinner. Perhaps they've always been this thin I don't know.  The fries were great and everyone was friendly."}
{"text":"What you have heard about In-N-Out is true.  It really is that good.  Now please take into consideration that I had been drinking vodka sodas for 3 hours prior to consumption, but it's Vegas so it just elevates the experience!    There was a line but it went quickly.  I ordered what my west coast friends recommended fries \"animal style\" and a burger \"protein style\" aka no bun.  All the ingredients tasted fresh and the burger was really all about the meat.  The sauce was delicious!  Now if there was a Steak and Shake right next door, it might a coin toss between the two."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Especially work personal, every one was very nice , absolutely everyone and their uniform looked cool too. Food was good. The only minus is that there is not enough tables for all people to sit down, so you have to wait."}
{"text":"I travel to Scottsdale once or twice a year, and whenever I'm there, a burger (or two) at In-N-Out is a MUST!  In the car ride over I can honestly feel the butterflies in my stomach. A nervous-excitedness comes over me like I'm seeing my boyfriend for the first time after a long vacation or something. Will the burger still have the same greasy burger perfected deliciousness with just the right amount of sauce, lettuce, tomato, cheese and buttery toasted bun? Yes and yes.  (insert When Harry Met Sally scene...you know the one)  Shame on me for being an out-of-towner though, as I have just discovered their 'secret menu'! Animal style, protein style - don't know what that means? Just order it anyways because it's going to be amazing! OH and they have 7-UP as a fountain soda choice! Where else is that possible?!  In-N-Out always manages to knock my socks off. Everything is fresh, and the service surpasses that of fast food.  They have perfected the classic burger and fries combo.   So...when's the next flight out?"}
{"text":"This is our second visit to In n Out.  The first was ok - nothing too special - food was hot and order correct.  Not so for the second visit.  The order was wrong - after repeating it 3 TIMES, and the fries were COLD.  Yuk.  I won't be back as it wasn't fantastic in the first place."}
{"text":"I'm kind of torn writing this review. My first time in Vegas and I knew I had to try out the famous In n Out burger. I liked all the food and the price was unbelievable. Everything came out fast and fresh. My only gripe is I expected more. It was good don't get me wrong but nothing super hype as everyone puts out. I also heard they have a secret menu so I would definitely go back and give it another try."}
{"text":"OK, so we don't have this chain in the Southeast US but man do I wish that we did!!! I heard about how great the burgers are, but all of the stories were underrated. The cheeseburger are made fresh, fries are crispy, and the sauce is divine. They give you a place mat and box to eat out of when you get your food to go.... You'll need it. The burger is quite messy, but it tastes wonderful. If you're a neat freak, stay away.... leave this to those of us appreciate a great burger. As I filled out the questions regarding price for this review, my wife said \" I don't really remember how much it costs, and I don't care...\""}
{"text":"As I sat in the back of my taxi, head reeling from last night's lack of sleep and numerous free casino drinks, pocket full of cash I won at Mandalay's blackjack tables, I thought to myself \"the only thing that will make this day better is In-n-Out for breakfast. Fortunately I had just leaned out the back window to order two grilled cheese animal-style sandwiches and a large coke from the drive-thru at this burger mecca. The cab driver admitted that no, this was not the first, nor would it be the last, time that he had been hired to drive someone off the strip to score some 10:30am in-n-out. I was confident that this was the right decision.   Twenty minutes later, as I sat across from the check-in counters at McCarran making a mess out of myself with delicious fast-food saucy cheese sandwiches, I thanked myself for making such a glorious call.   In-n-Out truly is special. It's fast food that's WAY better than any other options out there. Fast, fresh, delicious, clean, cheap, and damn good.   And this one has a big flashy light-up sign."}
{"text":"I think it's easier to state this way to understand better: If there is a shake shack burger in East coast then here in West, we have the In and Out!  I hope continuously consistently serve the way they have been. Two thumbs up!  Oh, and good parking spaces! (You might not understand how seriously important this is, but people who are from New York, Seoul, Shanghai, Beijing, or any major cities, you will understand lol)"}
{"text":"Delicious! As an east coaster, I was delighted to have the opportunity to grab some grub while I was in town for work. The burgers are the best part for me. It's like the ideal balance of grease, toasted bun and quality beef - cooked to perfection. The fries were not crunchy enough for me, but I read online afterwards I could have requested a crispy batch. So next time I will. All and all a great heart attack, take a nap, fat and happy experience."}
{"text":"Ryan was the best counter service person I've ever experienced. Appears the culture here is to provide awesome service. Kudos to Ryan and this In and Out Burgers."}
{"text":"I am still craving another In n Out burger as I write this.  We don't have the chain in Colorado which makes it a real treat when we visit.  The burgers are tasty but what I really love is all the fresh toppings from lettuce, tomato, freshly sliced onion, extra pickle, mustard, special sauce, ketchup, cheese....I'm lucky I could taste my burger with all the goodies I requested on my double cheese burger!  Somehow I managed to get my mouth around all that deliciousness and I enjoyed every single sinful bite!  Mmmmmmm!  The kids had the creamy milk shakes to accompany their meals and I went for the diet coke....yes diet....it's not funny!  We tried the freshly cut french fries and reveled in all the flavor.  I can't wait to return to that crazy busy and incredibly delicious burger joint!"}
{"text":"Great burgers. Get the fries \"crispy style\"."}
{"text":"i really developed an addiction living so close to an in and out burger.....Oh it was so easy to swing by and get my burger fix in.  I cannot say enough about them....they blow away any other fast-good burger---i think five guys strives to be as good.....but they are not.....If you ever want me to shut up---give me a cheeseburger..."}
{"text":"The food has always been high quality here! Get a double double animal style and you won't be disappointed. As much as I love fries these are probably my least favorite, as they aren't very crispy. The chocolate shake was pretty good!"}
{"text":"CRAVE!  I CRAVE! I really CRAVE.  Grabbed a DBL/DBL Animal style and was not disappointed. Also tried some animal style fries. Once was enough here.  Any chance I can visit a location, I have the locator app, I always stop in.  Must be a SoCal native thing."}
{"text":"I always wondered what's so awesome with In And Out.. Finally here on the other side of the country! Certainly, hopping and lively..  The menu isn't that long and apparently there's some sort of secret menu that I couldn't quite understand. It's fast food, so what's the deal? My coworker said this ain't fast food; but I beg to differ!  I ordered a hamburg and fries. It's suppose to be cooked to order so which explained why it took some time for our order to be ready.   My first impression from the first bite - wow, this bun is soft and moist! Second bite - yes, this bun is amazing. Third bite - the best fast food bun ever!"}
{"text":"at looong last tried the oft mentioned in n out burger. results: super cheap that's terrific. taste better than macDs for sure. compliments end there. not great .at.all. fries were below average for sure. if price is important this is your spot for value hence 3 stars. top of the chain is like smashburger and shake shack but those are total rips as everything is ala cart and oh boy overpriced. hey I know eat less hamburgers LOL   Rabid fan base reminds me of white castle. actually like that better as least the gimmick is more upfront.   Emperor is butt naked here folks!  smh big time!"}
{"text":"Everyone in vegas will tell you you should go to In and Out and ONLY this one. It's one of my stops when I vist and it never disappoints. They are ALWAYS slammed but the lines go fast and the food is great."}
{"text":"Every In-n-Out is expected to be some what the same. At this location I give a four star not because they are but because the service is great.   The food is a hit or miss at this location and that's not a good thing. It so isn't that bad. I mean some times it's like OH MY GOD this is why I love In-n-Out and sometimes it's like ummmm, it's just not all that great.   Tonight never the less was a good night. The Resturant is pretty much always busy by the way but food always seem to come out at a decent time. Tonight the buns were toasted perfectly where the edge is buttery and crunchy and the burger is juicy. The fries are the fries but this time it was not too hard and not too soft and with just the right amount of salting.  There was a good size line in the drive thru lane (not too big to where there had to be a live person outside taking curb side orders) but a size. With that said food was fresh and line moved quick. It is also nice that the drive thru is all glass and you can see them cooking inside which is entertaining and makes you forget that you are waiting when you are killing time in line.   Anyhow I haven't yet had a bad experience with service every time have been extremely pleasant but food needs to be consistence.   I give them  2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"If you grow up in California, In N Out is a staple amongst the fast food burgers. In N Out just IS. It has a specific taste that sometimes we west coasters just crave. I know there are indigenous cuisine from the East Coast that we may not understand, but a burger and fries from here simply cannot be substituted by anything else.  I'm a fan of the fries because they taste like potatoes, sometimes I think people don't want their french fries to taste like real potato's and in that case, go somewhere else ha ha!!! Nothing can replace the goodness of an In N Out burger, one must experience it!"}
{"text":"Unlike the competitors, these places are on their game. James Ku took my order and without any problems, got it right, hats off to you. The place is spotlessly clean. The have one associate going around dining room making sure everybody is good and the most fascinating thing I noticed, not one employee on a cell phone or texting. Smashburger could learn a thing or two."}
{"text":"Long lines but amazing burger and fries as always.   I always get the double double and the fries animal style. You cannot go wrong with that.  Manager was super sweet and nice"}
{"text":"Best burgers I have ever tasted for fast food. I prefer to go to In-N-Out than Five guys or smash burger. In-N-Out is cheap and a very very simple menu. perfection"}
{"text":"It was super busy. But didn't take long to get food. Sometimes it's hard to find seats because it's so packed. Our cashier was very friendly and deserves a raise. Customer service is exceptional here. Food was good as always"}
{"text":"you just cant go wrong with In-N-Out Burger. This place is the best for a late night snack. I love the protein style burger."}
{"text":"Come on what do you expect it's In and Out seven dollar number one animal style with fries well."}
{"text":"Maybe the novelty of In-n-Out has worn off on me. I didn't find this location to be any different than the ones I used to eat at in California, but I guess my tastes have matured. For all the hype and history, in the end it's just a fast food burger (although a decent one)."}
{"text":"I had to at least try it. I'm usually not on to visit chains during vacations or conferences for food, but I wanted to try the burger alot of the locals rave about.  I have the #1 - Double Cheeseburger combo with fries, without onions. Over, you could taste the freshness of the items, especially the bread. However, the burger was good, not as great as the locals rave. Personally, outside the bun, it tast d like Rally's/Checkers stores.  It's was good, but not good where to the point would make a special trip out of it me."}
{"text":"Honestly, how can you go wrong with In-N-Out? It's a quality fast food chain that delivers consistent quality for an attractive price. Plus, everyone who works here always seems cheerful and in a good mood. Definitely not the healthiest food in the world, but why not treat yourself every once in a while?!"}
{"text":"we went there today and asked if they had a military discount and the cashiers said no but they have one for the police. ummm that is fine but if it weren't for the military to protect the country they have their restaurants in they wouldn't have a restaurant business. just sayin. nothing against the police discount but seriously why not for the military. ?????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I admit it, I would sit in a drive through for an hour to get my double double and chocolate milkshake.  No guilt, no shame.  If you haven't eaten at In-N-Out, you need to.    I hear that they are coming through as far east as Texas--I'm just waiting for them to get to Indy so I can remind my taste buds what a burger should taste like."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly and always good food. Only downside is they can be packed and you sometimes you can't find a seat."}
{"text":"So I heard from the world that In N Out is the best burger.....I knew it wasn't before I ever went. That honor belongs to Aussie Burger in Greenville, SC. Anyway it is a good burger for fast food style burgers. It is not a great gourmet burger. I have never been a fan of soft French fries so I will not go there. The burgers are decent I can see how they could be addictive. I am not one of those people who are nuts about them. In my case they fill a craving once in a while."}
{"text":"My first In-N-Out Burger experience, and I was not disappointed. Yeah, it's fast food, but it's at a higher level than your typical McD's or Burger King. This is more along the lines of a Steak-n-Shake. I can't imagine getting less than the double-double here, as the patties are pretty thin. I ordered my burger \"animal style,\" and was so glad I did. Apparently this means that mustard is grilled into the patty, and grilled onions and pickles are included in your toppings. Additional toppings that came on the burger were lettuce, tomato, and thousand island. The combination of flavors was fantastic. A juicy, delicious burger. I will say, I thought the fries sucked, but the burger was so good I didn't really care. I'm glad I finally got to try the famous In-N-Out Burger. I wouldn't hesitate to stop at another when out West in the future."}
{"text":"I don't get it.  Everyone from the west coast is always raving about the burgers at this place. Why?? We came by here last night...had the animal fries and the double-double and the flavor was blah. Fries were cold...sauce was eh. The burger itself just had nothing memorable about it. At all. Except for the fact that it made me sick. I've been up all night with horrific gas pains. I will NOT be coming back here. Maybe it's just this location. If I'm ever in Cali, I'll take a bite out of someone else's burger before I decide it's worth it to order my own."}
{"text":"Ah in-n-out. Now that we live in Denver, when we have the opportunity to get some animal style burgers we do it.    This little place is more of a local location - since it is off the strip and across the highway!  It's a normal in-n-out, staff is friendly, no so hidden menu is available and food is great!  The fries i can't say i've ever been a fan, but they were hot and fried!   A good amount of outside seating and which delivery of the food!"}
{"text":"Coming from Miami, this cheeseburger loved up to expectations! All my Miami friends post pics of in N out and the last time I was able to eat it was 2008. Def lived up to the hype. The buns really made this burg - crunchy on the out soft and sweet on the in. And can't forget the fresh icebrrgs. Highly recommend esp if youre from the east coast!"}
{"text":"It is always so busy here, but the drive thru is extremely fast & get your order correct, very friendly staff & the food was yummy!! Make sure to try there special sauce to dip your fries in!!! My husband and I also got chocolate shakes from here... They are so delicious! If you want a quick and good burger place I highly recommend this location. Beautiful landscape in the drive thru as well as it's kept very clean!! We ordered our burgers special ways and they did them perfect! Thank you for a yummy dinner.."}
{"text":"I love them too much. Try to limit my visits to once a month because they are just so darn good. Fresh! I have never gotten bad food here. I have always had friendly, fast efficient service. The prices are right, the food is fresh non nonsense straight forward good. I know there's probably 5000 calories in the meal, but plan for the occasion and splurge once in awhile. It's better than McDonalds with a bunch of frozen chemicals."}
{"text":"Tonight the kid at the first window erroneously charged my card for the vehicle behind me (a much higher charge.) Before telling me anything, he called for help from a person named Joey. Before actually telling me what was going on (I overheard the situation through the open drive-thru window) Joey quickly reversed the charges for the first swipe and then charged me for my order. So now I have a false charge that ties up money/funds that I can't use for other things until my bank authorizes the reversal in 5-7 WORKING days.   When I brought this to Joey's attention he acted stunned and as if he wasn't aware of this process that anyone who has ever returned an item or cancelled an order very well knows. Joey apparently thought that I would instantly get my money back. This has never and probably will never be a possibility with the world's banking institutions as they currently are. I asked him if he was the manager, he stated he was. So then I asked for his district manager's card to contact them about this experience since no attempt to either inform me of the situation or make it right was attempted.   Joey seemed to cop a bit of an attitude at this point (as his demeanor and tone seemed that he is the type of person who always has to be right in situations) but still offered me the card at the next window. When he handed me the card it was for a different person with the title store manager of that location, so Joey also lied to me about his position. I'm assuming he was the shift lead, but that is not the same as a manager for being trained in these types of situations. It was obvious that the first window worker and Joey were not trained very well in customer service which is what I had always heard IN-N-Out were known for.   Had I been someone on a much more limited budget my account could now be charged multiple overdraft fee's, but these untrained children who work at this location didn't and don't seem to care one bit. This is the first time I've ever had a bad experience at any IN-N-Out restaurant but I've got to say that I dont trust them with my debit card anymore. They cavalierly spent a customer's finances for them without acknowledging any wrongdoing.   This is not the way we are trained in customer-facing retail. I can't believe the incompetence I experienced tonight. Also, when I went to call the number on the card to leave my information, it's a dead loop recording that never allowed me to leave my information for a manager call back, so hopefully this review gets my displeasure across and costs this store at least some business, as I'm sure I can't be the only one.   Make sure to ask the person working the first window the amount you are being charged prior to them swiping your card. He read my order to me right, but then charged me for an order more than twice the amount I was supposed to be charged, and then my correct charge on top of that, all before mentioning an issue and how he was planning on \"fixing\" it. He obviously should have more training and experience before being placed in that position again.   As for Joey, he got called into help a bad situation that he didn't cause, but as the \"manager\" you have to always take care of the customer first and worry about your store's bottom line last. No attempt to make it right for me or the funds lost until my bank gets around to my refund were made. That's just poor training for anyone considering themselves to be a retail manager."}
{"text":"Finally got to In N Out Burger, went double double Animal Style and just pure awesomeness.  Loved it.  The fries were ok, burger def highlight. Also tried vanilla milkshake which was legit. Met/exceeded expectations so we good"}
{"text":"Israel took our order outside while it was humid and muggy but he still had an awesome upbeat attitude! And as always in n out is my favorite \"fast\" food restaurant! Although I use that term loosely. This location is perry u new so it's really clean and in a good shopping center. Even if ur trying to be healthy I would get protein style which has no buns and is just wrapped in lettuce but still tastes amazing. And get a Neapolitan shake it's all the flavors (strawberry vanilla chocolate) mixed together. Yum quick and probably the best and healthiest fast food you can get on the run."}
{"text":"This in n out is always clean, from the outside, to the inside & even the bathrooms. The staff are quick, helpful and never skip a beat. My favorite In n Out location for sure!"}
{"text":"This was our first In-N-Out burger experience, and it was a good one. It is definitely one of the better fast food burgers out there. This location gets excellent marks for allowing us to walk in 5 minutes prior to close and actually seem happy that we were there.  We had the Double Double and an order of fries. The double double was flavorful without being greasy. The fries were good, obviously very fresh. This place rates pretty high for me among fast food joints, a close second to Wendy's in the flavorful burger department. It actually gets a bump above Wendy's for their fries, since In-N-Out Burger has much better fries.  All in all, a solid choice for fast food with great employees that care."}
{"text":"Consistently a GREAT experience here. This In N Out carries what I call the element of success for any restaurant. Great food, service, and prices. The food is always delicious and the people who work here are the friendliest employees I have ever seen at any restaurant. They seem to truly enjoy their job and it's nice to see that considering at other fast food places the employees seem miserable. The managers are also very nice and seem to treat everyone great which may be what keeps the morale up. These little things just seem to make my visit that much more enjoyable. Keep up the amazing service In N Out."}
{"text":"The best bang for your buck close to the Vegas strip. The place is always packed (for that reason) but they are very efficient in churning out orders. You will probably have to wait a bit to get a table but turnover is high because people don't hang out there for too long.   The burgers will definitely hit the spot after a night out. I would recommend doing animal style on the fries and not the burger if you get the combo. However, the fries in general were really disappointing (friend described it best as cardboard). The animal style with cheese and onions made the fries more tolerable."}
{"text":"In our recent visit to Las Vegas, my sister and I were craving In-N-Out and decided to get some from this location. We were both a little bit disappointed to be honest with you. Being California natives, we go to In-N-Out in our location every now and then, so we knew what to expect. The beef patties that we received in our burgers were dry and wasn't seasoned, so they ended up tasting bland; however, it was still edible (especially since we were hella hungry)."}
{"text":"Perfect every time with great service! The burgers and animal fries are to die for! Nothing to complain about except for there always being a long line of cars in the drive thru! Which is honestly a good sign, rather than there being no cars. It says the food is good and popular!"}
{"text":"Best little cheeseburger around! Plain & simple, tasty meat, delicious sauce! Fast & cheap, couldn't be any happier! Great place to eat at if you're in a hurry & you'd like something tasty & yummy to eat! They have a secret menu so make sure you google it so you can order from it when at one of their few locations. They aren't all over so to try one, you're quite lucky. I ordered a root bear float, animal fries, & the animal burger which was all off the secret menu."}
{"text":"I was afraid the myth and the legend of In N Out Burger would be hard to live up to, but I am pleased to say that it did live up to the hype.   I've heard people proselytize In N Out, I've seen the long lines of cars waiting for a chance to revel in its sanctity, and I've wonder why there is so much praise for an inglorious bun and and meat patty? The answer is that they keep things simple and fresh. Nothing fancy, nothing over the top. Just a bun, a good sized patty of ground beef, cheese, lettuce and a slice of tomato. That's it. No fussy, no trying to redefine the hamburger, and no feeling like you just ate a bun full of grease. And, the french fries?! I guess I never knew what real french fries, straight from potato to oil to basket, tasted like.  They are fantastic!  I wish it hadn't taken me so long to discover In N Out. But I am glad I finally got to see what the fuss was all about. I'm definitely a convert now!"}
{"text":"Simply the best. It was first time ever eating In-N-Out and I was not upset one bit! I had the double cheeseburger with fries animal style. The animal style fries were out of this world and lived up to all of my expectations. Even though this place was packed the customer service was still amazing and I'll be back next year for my annual visit!"}
{"text":"Drive Thru Experiences:  1st asked for no onions on all burgers..... got onions on all burgers. 2nd asked for no spread, no ketchup, and no mustard.... got spread and extra pickles for some reason 3rd I just wanted 2 normal double doubles.... got home... bit into one... and had my mouth on fire because it had peppers. I didn't even know they had peppers. Today (4th) I think they are messing with me on purpose. I asked for no onions. Some how that translated to extra onions and peppers again.  Sucks that this is the closest in n out to my house....  I live in n out but this one doesn't love me back. I think they might have seen me drive over to the Wendy's across the street and got jealous or something.   Burger joints be Cray Cray"}
{"text":"Loooove In-N-Out burger! If you haven't tried it, your missing out. Truely my favorite burger I've ever eaten. If you stop in, there will prob be a long line, but don't get discouraged, it moves very quickly as the staff is above par here. They only have a few things listed on the menu, but there is a secret menu for this restaurant  chain and you can check that out @ http://www.badmouth.net/in-n-outs-secret-menu/ or just ask any local, lol. If your looking for a melt in your mouth burger experience, this is it!"}
{"text":"I only  go here out of convenience and it's better than going to another fast food chain.... ie (burger king or Jack in the crack)  I usually order the secret menu stuff like, Animal style fries and Lemon up.  Sometimes the fries leave a bad taste in my mouth afterwards. Sometimes they also give me stomaches.... :-\  Fulfilling, but not craving?"}
{"text":"This In-N-Out Burger is located conveniently off of the HWY17 and the Carefree Highway (223A) and is hidden in the large plaza to the left after directly turning right when getting off the highway.   This location is a lot like the other In-N-Out Burger locations in terms of friendly service, clean tables, and nicely air-conditioned. The woman at the register was very attentive and friendly, the food tasted especially fresh at this establishment, and the food was out within about 5 minutes of ordering it."}
{"text":"This place gets packed both inside and through the drive thru, which is pretty typical of most In-N-Out locations. You'll just want to be super careful where you park because you might having trouble getting out because of the line of cars behind you.  The burgers have always been tasty and their prices are super cheap. When I'm trying to eat low carb, the double-doubles protein style are definitely a great option. Their fries are pretty decent if you're going to eat them right away (they get cold fast), and their shakes are pretty tasty."}
{"text":"The burger was okay, and the fries weren't that warm. I would rather go to Five Guys than go here again."}
{"text":"I am just a fan, regular visitor when it's anywhere in reach. I am not much for big burgers, but the Double Double Animal style has won me over, it's just so delicious. You can wake me up for it! But if you do, make sure the fries are there too and a vanilla milkshake, it completes my fun fest!"}
{"text":"As a native Californian, I have a weird superiority complex about In N Out (most of us do). I think it's the best fast food burger chain and is miles ahead of Five Guys and Shake Shack, etc.   This location is kind of situated in a weird place. It's not actually in the target shopping center, even though it's at the corner of it. You have to enter separately through the entrance closest to the store. Weird, I know.   Aside from the odd entryway, this location serves consistently quality food. My go-to order: hamburger protein style w/ no onions, fries, and a small Dr. Pepper. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"i love in n out! Animal style anything, burger or fries. Neapolitan shakes are amazing, as are the root beer floats. Gotta love the secret menu! :D"}
{"text":"Whenever I travel out west, I always remember the possibility of In-N-Out Burger halfway through my trip.  Fast food is not often on my mind but as soon as I remember that I have possible access to In-N-Out, its must-have-it-now stop for me.    Most recently, I was visiting a friend in Tempe and we were running errands.  I made her take me here.  This means I googled the location and then gave her turn-by-turn directions....there was no other option.  We arrived to a busy parking lot and an even busier interior.  I went for the gold.  That means I ordered the double-double animal style.  When in Rome...right?  Oh, it was all I hoped for and more.  Delish!  The freshness of the ingredients definitely makes a difference even if it just fast food.  Minus one star for the fries which were kinda gross.  I didn't even bother with them after like five fries.  Because everything is cooked fresh, the wait times are longer than your typical fast food joint.  Be prepared to wait a few minutes, but its worth it.  Service as this location was friendly, the place was clean.  When it comes to fast food burgers, this time it was a complete success!"}
{"text":"I order two double double burgers and the animal fries. It was way too much food. Two double double burgers were very tasty. I would go back for more. The fries weren't that good. The fried were not crispy and tasted cold. The fries dropped this place to four stars."}
{"text":"Don't know what the big deal is about In N Out burger. They're Just average. Fries are dry. Milk shake nothing to write home about. Five Guys is better. Smash Burger is better too. Maybe if you're comparing this to McDonald's yes it's a better burger-but really you can do much better. It's like Coors beer used to be when you couldn't get it west of the Rockies-everybody wanted it. But then when it had total distribution, nobody drank it. Same thing with in and out burger, because it's on the West Coast and you can only get it on vacation people kind of crave it, but really it's nothing special. If you have opposing views I'd love to hear it. For more foodie chat visit me on Facebook @FoodieGuido."}
{"text":"this location is always busy... actually all in-N-outs are! You can go wrong with the animal styled fries on the secret menu and a tasty shake to top it all off! Also the service is always great and they keep pretty clean considering how busy they constantly are."}
{"text":"Only good thing about it was it's open late. Burger was OK, french fries were awful. ate a couple and threw them away."}
{"text":"The fries are really good and the burgers are average. Don't get me wrong, it's better than McDonalds, but there is so much hype around it I guess I expected to much. It is above average for fast food and everybody should check it out once"}
{"text":"Overall an excellent In-N-Out location. They do a good job of keeping the dining area clean despite being busy what seems like every time I come in. Service remains lightning fast and I have yet to have an order messed up (this is big because my husband is super picky and doesn't like anything on his burgers other than cheese and ketchup). I have also taken my dog to sit with us on the patio here and not been told this wasn't allowed. Staff is also very friendly. Quality of the food is as good as any other location."}
{"text":"The burgers are the best...especially the toasted buns.  The fries are like potato sticks.  Love their hot peppers!"}
{"text":"What else can be said about the best burgers and fries on the planet.  Especially considering that it's only $6 for a full meal.  Always a pleasure."}
{"text":"How a bada$$ from Cali orders:  Number 1 (or 2) + light grilled onions + substitute the drink w/ a chocolate shake + tell em to cut the burger in half = now your a bada$$  Plus they have good parking!"}
{"text":"Not big on the location of this In-N-Out but the staff & quality of food makes up for it.   I love me some animal fries (cheesy fries with spread) to go along with my protein style 4x2 (4 beef patties with 2 slices of cheese)....I love how easy it is to switch up your order and staff always is always friendly in case you're new to the In-N-Out lingo."}
{"text":"What can you say about simple, basic, fresh and really tasty burger joint that hasn't been said before?  Honestly I love how simple and tasty it really is.  Reminds me of Dick's back in Seattle (but their fries are even better!) but I love the toasted bun of the burger as well!  While I don't use the \"secret menu\" it's there and many go Animal style!"}
{"text":"This location is really organized with its layout and service.  Will say on my visit the quality was Mmm good.. customer service was good and will gladly come back to this location."}
{"text":"I have always loved their burgers, maybe it is their fresh ingredients they use or just the taste of the burger compared to other fast food places."}
{"text":"Now let me tell you about an American classic. Straight forward menu with quality products.We can get our family of 4 dinner for under $20. Now thays a steal for the quality and good porportions. I've been here so many times drive thru and dine in. Perfect menu for a straight forward or a secret menu for those who desire for more from here. When you order drive thru, you LITERALLY get to see them prepare the food. My favorite thing to watch is how they make the French fries from the potatoes. They are always so busy so sometimes the drive thru line is way out on the main street. They are pretty good at moving the line along. There is someone outside taking orders way on advance. Makes me wonder if they ever stop working so hard. When I reach the moment of truth aka when I get my food, they are always great at asking what I need. If ONLY they actually listened sometimes. I always specify how many spreads,peppers I want. And they always seem to miss some. It's not a big deal for me but then I have to sacrifice my spread to the hubby.  Dine in, is always hectic. People everywhere sometimes no wear to sit even outside. Mainly why I've been going drive thru for awhile. Now let's talk about parking and leaving. Oh my sometimes the exit is blocked by the people in the drive thru waiting line. The main reason I would choose not to come to In-N-Out is because of how popular they are. And I know it sounds ridiculous. But the traffic the lines sometimes too much and not worth it."}
{"text":"I came through the drive through late at night after a long shift at work. I had the best customer service given to me! Every employee was smiling and seemed to actually be enjoying their jobs. I was greeted with a smile and the employees in the drive through were so kind and helpful. Also, my fries were fresh and hot which I greatly appreciate!"}
{"text":"I have been to LV 4 times this year and Im going again on Monday.  I never miss a trip to In N Out, just wish they were open 24hrs.  A Double double is a must.  Highly recommend the food here and the price is cheap.  If you take a cab through the drive thru don't forget to offer them something from In N Out too, they will thank you."}
{"text":"Place is always very busy and clean and my kids just love comming here.. go animal style fries and burger... and i just read about crispy fries gonna try that next time we go..."}
{"text":"They call this 'in-and-out' but the place is always packed to the max. And, while it seems like you might need to gird up for a 40 minute wait, it never happens. They keep the line moving. The food is always fresh, hot, well-prepared. The employees are mostly friendly given that they're badly overworked.  If you're looking for a big variety, keep moving. They don't have it."}
{"text":"It's nothing of any special sorts. But it does hit the spot when your on the west coast. Especially if your in Vegas and you don't want to spend and arm and leg just for lunch. This would definitely hit the spot. If your going for the beast mode. Get the animal style on anything! If you want to keep it carb free. Get the protein style! Since your there. You mine as well go for the 9 yards and get the shakes! mmmmm good!"}
{"text":"The food is great but to be honest you kinda have to be in the mood for it. The size of the patties seems a little too small but like I said the food is great. But I could eat their animal fries  all day every day."}
{"text":"I only wish we had these on the East Coast! This was my second visit to In-n-Out Burger. Both times I stopped on my way to the airport. This time, I heard about the infamous \"secret menu\" and asked for my fries and cheeseburger \"animal style\".  I gotta say it was really good but maybe since it was hyped so much I was a little underwhelmed. The sauce and onions were a little too much for my taste. I love their normal cheeseburger and fries and will probably either get that next time or try another item from their secret menu. Will try again next year when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"My first time trying in-n-out burgers and fries and they were AMAZING. I ordered it animal style of course, because as an Instagram foodie, I've always wanted to try it the right way!!! That sauce was SO GOOD. It honestly reminded me of Big Mac sauce, but it was so flavorful and the burgers were juicy and so perfect. Ugh wish I had this place in NYC!!!!"}
{"text":"Any time you can get In-N-Out outside of Cali it's always a good thing to me. I love In-N-Out so much my wife gets jealous sometimes. While this is a chain it's the fast food burger joint that all should be judged by. My only complaint is why isn't it on the strip?"}
{"text":"I mouth-gasmed all over my burger and fries. It was super crowded so the food took a while, but I sorta felt like I was in the footloose town at that snack place where all the youngsters went to play music and dance in secret. (Except the preacher dude didn't  show up and crash the party!) Good vibe, good food. Of course it's Vegas tho, and I may have had the beer goggles for my burger :/"}
{"text":"We stopped here for supper.  We didnt have to wait very long to order our food.  I ordered their number two meal which is a single cheeseburger, fries and a soda for $5.60 plus tax which isnt bad....  my food was fresh and hot.  My burger had their special sauce, cheese, lettuce, tomato and onions, raw or grilled... mine had grilled. It was very tasty!!"}
{"text":"2 days ago ate at a different location and food was excellent. At this location our food was not as good. I think our order must have gotten misplaced or overlooked because when we got it the fries weren't fresh and the sandwich wasn't hot and the shake was almost lukewarm. Flavors were there, freshness wasn't."}
{"text":"Times have changed. Unfortunately, I am no longer a Sun Devil. I am not in between classes and certainly don't look the age of a college student. Therefore, I feel like I stick out like a sore thumb at this particular location. Do I care? Nope. In-N-Out is good no matter what college campus it is on :) As with most of their locations, GREAT customer service and a fantastic product. Nothing like a grilled cheese (animal style) to make you feel a bit better about life."}
{"text":"Always busy, but alway dependable. Also, always my first stop after landing in Vegas from my early morning flight from the east coast.  Burgers are juicy, fries are golden, the shake is cold and thick.  Have your burger Animal Style or order from the hidden menu. Just Google it as its not on the posted menu."}
{"text":"I'd smoke out all of the employees with one giant blunt to say thank you for the dank meal they provided me with."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love in n out? I won't ever understand. I live close to this location, so it's my local joint. Sometimes during lunch a small dinner it's busy of course, but that's common for all locations. I love getting the grilled onions and pickles on my burger. They've never messed up my order and it's always been hot, fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Simple burger and a simple price.  If you want a hamburger, fries and a shake and nothing more then that it is a great place for a fresh home made taste of burger.   Kids dont always want a hamburger and this doesnt have any other options so if your in the mood for a burger I would choose this over McDonalds for sure but dont look for a variety they dont even carry Mayo for the burger."}
{"text":"I decided to have lunch here for the first time in quite a while. The burger was pretty good but the fries were not much warmer than room temperature and somewhat soggy. By far not the best fries in the industry. The place is always busy and it can be hard to find a place to sit. However, there was a young lady making sure that tables were cleaned as soon as someone left and as soon as I received my order I found a place to sit."}
{"text":"We arrived in Vegas from Ohio after a long day of traveling and just wanted something to eat that was fast and delicious. When I saw In-N-Out burger I had to try it. We do not have these in Ohio! The menu is very small- the focus is the burger. First off, this is Vegas, so there was an annoying guy in front of me yelling, picking up pennies, calling the cashiers \"cute and sexy\", and flamboyantly twirling around the restaurant. Not In-N-Out's fault but oh boy it was about to ruin my experience. Anyway, the service line was fast and efficient. I ordered the double double with fries and a drink. It was amazing! The burger was juicy and tasty. It had lettuce, tomatoes, onion (white), and a special sauce. Yum yum yum. The fries are \"hand cut\" and thin and I actually thought that I was going to like them more than I did. They were a bit bland. Not too bad though. I'm very critical when it comes to the taste and crispiness of my fries. This meal was much needed and so worth every calorie! If you need something fast, delicious, and cheap....come here!"}
{"text":"My first time ever at in and out burger...after hearing how Goood it is. I must admit, it was ok. The milkshake seem kinda warm.. I enjoy shake shack milkshakes a lot better. However the staff was super friendly. High five guys!"}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out and I truly am sad that a lot of other states don't get to experience this burger. This location was fast and accurate. Ordering may be as easy as 1-2-3, however, I like to make it a bit more complicated which can be a hit or miss depending on the teenager behind the register =/ So, usually my order is correct 3 out of 5 times so I give this location a 5 for being on top of their game.  My \"simple\" order: #1 (Double-Double), well done, no onions, fried ketchup, fried mustard NO PICKLES (that's where they go wrong sometimes and I HATE pickles), cheese fries well done/crispy, a lemon up, and a neopolitan shake. Oh, and extra spread for the fries...YUM!  They are pretty fast too...no matter how long the line is they keep a good pace going and rarely make the wait longer than 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Did i just step foot in Burger Heaven!??!?! Oh how i still crave for you ! If only you had locations in Toronto! Best burger EVER!!!"}
{"text":"In AZ for a couple of days visiting friends. I can't go back to Chicago w/o having a burger from this place...  I don't know what the big deal is with this place.  It was so many condiments on my burger that I couldn't find the patty! Or taste it either!!! I don't ever have to have another one. It is not better than a lot of chain places in Chicago.   I love my \"animal style fries\"...and...well...  \"That's life!\" (Frank Sinatra)  (That is also the end of this review)"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times.. There's always a huge line, no matter what time it is! But, that must speak to the quality of the food. Very reasonable prices, small menu -- really just burgers, fries and milkshakes. Burger is cooked to perfection and has a special sauce that is delicious. Potatoes are fresh and real! A nice chance from other fast food places. Milkshakes are refreshing, they can mix flavors if you ask."}
{"text":"I love in n out and this one is closest to my place.  I come here allllllll the time and they never disappoint.  Also, the people there are always nice as can be.  The only time they ever messed up my order was when they gave me a root beer instead of a Dr. Pepper.  It kind of ruined my day but I'll let it slide."}
{"text":"In-n-out is always amazing, but this location is a pro when it comes to fast service. Never wait in line for a ridiculously long period of time. Their food is always excellent."}
{"text":"Having heard a lot of good things about In-N-Out prior to visiting, I went in with high expectations; let's just say they met them and then some.  I had a cheeseburger, fries and a root beer float.  It's easy to tell that all the ingredients are fresh; the onions have bite to them and a little crunch, the lettuce is crisp and the tomato tastes fresh and isn't soggy at all. The buns are warm and fluffy and the patty tastes grilled, like a proper one should.  Their burgers overall are just fantastic and the fries are right up there with them, made on the spot, crispy and just amazing.  The service is also great, everyone is friendly, patient and helpful.  Can't recommend this place enough if you're on the road and looking for a great place to eat."}
{"text":"I love In-n-Out!! I miss the west coast life... It was cool to see an in-n-out in Vegas, I wasn't expecting it. This place was really packed when we went on Saturday night, but I was able to get a table in the outdoor seating area. Cheap, flavorful, fast, as always!"}
{"text":"Worst in n out ever.  I spent $25 bucks and got crap.  Not happy.  All four of our fries were half full.  My burger had tomato when I asked for no tomato.  I asked for spread and they gave me ketchup.  Since we went thru the drive thru we didn't see all this till we were well on our way down the road.  I don't mind getting crappy food but when I spend that much money I expect the fries to be full. My kids didn't even get full before our road trip Planning to call corporate. Go to the next one down the road."}
{"text":"Where to start.  Ugh.  Spent $30 to feed my family.  Asked for no tomatoes and they put two big fat hearty slices.  Nasty.  Pulled them out for of course it left that nasty seeded snail trail.  Yuck but I can deal.  Then my son.  Eating his 4x4 and get to almost the last bite and finds a bug in it.   It looked like possibly a large mosquito.  Not sure.   It was some large winged thing.  I took it in and pointed it out to the lady at the register and she thoroughly examined it like I was a liar trying to get out of it or something.   They replaced it about 15 minutes later.  Just an overall bad experience.  This is a very fast paced in n out so I try to look past the dirty tables and full trash.  But bugs? Can't let that slide."}
{"text":"Honestly what is bad about in and out?  Nothing, I think they are e everything you want in a fast food chain."}
{"text":"Pretty decent. Serves a good cheap burger. Animal style fries are delicious. Definitely a dozen steps up from burger king, mcdonalds, other chain restaurants but still pales in comparison to the shake shack. Sorry shake shack has superior meat, superior juiciness and flavor. Overall I find in and out extremely overrated and overhyped. I heard so much I was expecting my mind to be blown. I left really satisfied and happy but it's really not THAT special. Still it's a good burger and if there was one around me, I think I'd actually stop in once in a while."}
{"text":"In and out is the bee's knees!! I only started hitting this place in the past few years but people in England would freak if they had this. Excellent food(For fast food) made in front of you Sometimes you have to wait but well worth it.  Gives fat burger a run for the money Much  ALOHA there A.B."}
{"text":"I love this place milkshakes are great and the fries are good too, this is a really good cheeseburger when in the mood 4 one."}
{"text":"My last and first time I had InNout was in dallas last year. So i was beyond amped to know that there are plenty of InNout's in the Phoenix area. Of course my first stop for food was to InNout right after my flight landed. Please dnt judge me because i wasnt the only one making this trip from the airport lol. I actually seen a group of people, who i assume ubered to InNout because they wheeled their luggage into the store.   Now on to the food. For some reason I fancied this location more, than the one in Dallas. We all know Texas is the beef capital but for some reason the burger tasted better in phoenix. It was so delicious i could have cried tears of joy biting into that burger. The freshness of the meat and the lightly toasted bun with the animal style goodness is just pure bliss. The animal fries are just heavenly!!!!!! I just cant understand who wouldn't love this. Only bad part is that i thought it was a good idea to eat outside and the of course melted my milkshake with in 2 minutes. Thanks 95 degree weather .  Other than that if your in the tempe or ASU area stop at this location its worth the wait and the staff is always friendly giving great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy my visits to In-N-Out, usually get the cheese burger w/grilled onions, fries and drink... can't go wrong"}
{"text":"What else can you say about it, except it is absolutly mouth watering. The staff was overly friendly and fast, love coming here."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and absolutely amzing burgers. I absolutely love having there burgers!"}
{"text":"I was so pressed to make it here while on the west coast. We do not have any where I'm from. It was definitely worth the trip off the strip."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love In N Out? I love getting the grilled onions on my burger here. Have you tried their grilled onions on your burger? You need to. It's the best. This location is my new local In N Out. They're always jam packed busy. Or so it seems that way when I go on over there. The food tastes good and I'll be coming again for a fix."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. In and out is always good. I decided to do a review on this place because of the staff. The place was packed for lunch and I had both of my children with me. They actually came up to me and asked what my order number was and brought the food out to me. That was so awesome of them to do that!"}
{"text":"I love me some in n out. I guess today I was just bummed that my fries weren't as crispy and warm as they normally are. It happens. I got heir cheese burger with grilled onions. It was delicious. My son got a grilled cheese and he liked it. It's definitely not a place for grilled cheese tho. Burgers and fries tho, fo sho."}
{"text":"Went during lunch end of lunch rush. Extremely disappointed. Stopped in with two coworkers before a meeting. We all ordered together. All of our ordered were messed in up in some degree. We order a a number one plain with animal fries, a number one no onions, and a number two with onions. The cashier rung up our order as animal style burgers, and plain fries which you really could tell it was rung up incorrectly until the food arrived. My colleague went to the register to let them know we didn't our animal fries that we ordered. He quickly asked to see the receipt so she came back to get the receipt. He told her you didn't pay for it. And he didn't return the receipt.  She came back to the table saying that we didn't order it.  And I Told her I did. So I went to the register to tell the gentleman the situation and before I could open my mouth he tell me we didnt pay for it. So First I asked for my receipt back. And I told him are whole order was messes up. Then he shows me they the burgers were animal style which we did not order that way. And I told hime I did order animal fries. He asked me if I wanted them I said yes. So he had a different cashier ring me up for them. The nice lady did apologize for the error. So I paid for the order of animal fries and she said she would bring them to the table. The same guy who was a little combative came to the table and said he needed to take the plain fries and the would  the animal fries out. Animal fries were brought out and we began to eat our now Luke warm food. After reviewing the receipt in detail, I paid for 3 combos and an order of animal fries, so I don't understand why he took the fries back. The end experience is that I was treated rudely, overcharged, and had lukewarm messed up order. Not happy at all."}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service. Grilled cheese, animal style and well done fries. This place speaks for itself...yum!"}
{"text":"Say what! I love this place. After a long ass flight from NYC and a lack of unlimited snacks on an airline that shall remain nameless we grabbed our drop top car (yes drop top) and saw this from the highway. Being this was our third time to Vegas together we are really getting a feel for this place and baby this will be one of OUR spots from now on. My poor husband's blood sugar was dropping and needed food fast (me too I mean your girl loves to eat). Well it was fast. We even found a spot right outside to sit and savor our fare. I'd take InandOut over McD's anytime. I think we have a tradition now. Get off plane, get car, go to In and Out burger."}
{"text":"I just ordered cheeseburger and animal style fries to go. I live literally 3 min away. When i got home the burger was completely cold, meat felt like it was out for 20min and stiff and the cheese was already hard. I cant help bit to think it was premade burger. The fries were still warm. Just check your takeout burger before yoy leave. Burger was just cold and disgusting."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about In-N-Out Burger so I was quite eager to try it while we were in Vegas.  To be honest I was a bit skeptical as I've eaten at a lot of burger places in my life and I hear all the time about how great some shops like In-N-Out Burger are but they rarely live up to the hype.  A good burger is a pretty rare thing, a truly fantastic burger is almost unheard of in my opinion.  So one night after a night of fun in Vegas the wife and I decided to try In-N-Out Burger finally.  We arrived late in the night, after many a drinks, and stood in a pretty long line.  Thankfully the line moved very quickly so it wasn't long before it was our turn to order.  I ordered the animal style burger and some fries and the wife got the same.  After waiting about five minutes or so our order came out.  There was a lot of people in the restaurant but we were able to find a spot.    I was pretty impressed with just how truly tasty the burger looked in it's little container and the fries were very tasty looking as well.  It didn't take long before I ate a few of those and wow, they were really good!  Very crispy and not too oily. Very much like the king of fries: McDonalds.  I am not a \"fry guy\" so for me to like fries is almost unheard of.  Nearly everywhere aside from McDonalds I never get fries (Burger King=onion rings, Wendy's=chili, etc).  But finally it was time to actually taste the burger and I was blown away by the explosion of flavor.  The animal sauce wasn't quite like 1,000 Island or Big Mac Sauce or anything like I thought it'd taste.  It is really difficult to describe, but I will say it was delicious and I loved it.  Will definitely have to get that on the fries next time.    So to say I love In-N-Out Burger is an understatement.  The wife loved it as well.  We honestly were tempted to go back again the next night and came very close to doing so but ultimately our desire to try some new places won out.  I sort of hope they never get these in Ohio or I may end up gaining about 10 pounds a month from pigging out on their food.  A must try, I am definitely coming back here for a burger next time I'm in Vegas or any other place that has In-N-Out Burger!"}
{"text":"Finally, an In-N-Out has opened in my neck o' the woods. On the first visit I had the classic double-double with fries and a chocolate milkshake and it's pretty much what one would expect from this popular fast food chain: tasty, fast, and inexpensive. On another visit I had the double-double protein style and \"light\" (lightly fried, not crispy regular) fries - you need to specify if you want to order these, as these are from the  \"secret\" menu, meaning that they serve such variations which are not listed on the simple menu board. Very convenient location, lots of parking, and even when busy the staff remains cool, generous with smiles, and very efficient."}
{"text":"I'm not really understanding what is so special about In and Out burgers. You tell me?   For the most part their burgers and fries taste very bland without adding a lot of salt, ketchup, and that simple Thousand Island sauce they use on the burgers.   The beef is a very thin patty that is not all that juicy. The fries are dry and many times overcooked. The shakes taste artificial and from out of a machine.   The cooks pour way too much salt on the burgers and fries, drowning the burgers and fries in salt.  I see nothing special about In and Out at all.   Now...when you compare it to Shake Shack burgers, fries, and shakes, Shake Shack comes out way ahead in taste, service, quality overall...way better than In and Out."}
{"text":"I had to try this place because of the hype.  I am a five guys burger kind of guy. So I ordered just a cheeseburger.  I had mentality of the size of five guys. I wish I had ordered the double cheeseburger instead of a regular cheeseburger.  The patty was very thin and small.  I thought the burger had more fillers than the actual meat.  I have to admit that the tomato and lettuce is really fresh.  I have to give credit for that.  I just didn't taste much of the patty.  I didn't see the hype of this place.  The fries tasted like chopped card board.  For the on going debate, I give a nod to five guys."}
{"text":"Was expecting the best burger since the hype for this place is out of this world. So I got everything animal style and the meal was just okay. IMO way better than McDonalds but not near as good as FiveGuys. Glad I could say I've tried their food."}
{"text":"This place has definitely improved since my last visit seven years ago. The burgers are much better especially for the price. I still think the fries are terrible, however."}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out and I have been to quite a few ones all over the west. This is actually the first 5 star rating I could give them, because at that location they are awesome. The food is always spot on and they customize it anyway I like and always with a smile. I also like that it's not too busy there. Some places in California are insane. My daughter loves to go to this location. If you are near by and hungry, you really can't go wrong there."}
{"text":"This In-n-Out is awesome because when I was here there were a lot of coeds in bikinis.  That has not been my typical In-n-Out experience so that was definitely a bonus.  I'm a big In-n-Out fan so what else is there to say?    You can see all the In-n-Out Burgers I've eaten in 2010 in this blog entry: http://pulp.orangephotography.com/genex/?cat=174"}
{"text":"I couldn't believe it but I was the ONLY customer here on a Monday night around 11pm.  WTF?!  Well, the burger was good just as it always is.  This place just was too clinical.  I think maybe now that the woman who founded INO has passed away and the daughter or granddaughter who took control is now expanding it too fast.  oh well..."}
{"text":"OK this particular one isn't the one I think I'm talking about but hey In-n-Out is always good (i mean always fresh!)  Anyhow, if you are off strip - it's defnitely worth it.  I've been so desparate as to take a cab here through the drive through just for some decent sustenance that isn't going to cost me more than an Andrew Jackson!"}
{"text":"I really am not a fan of in and out burger. I cannot understand why it is so popular. I never feel like I am eating a hamburger only a BLT. The meat is only a sliver  and you could hardly taste it. I only like the french fries when they are hot and I must put salt on them. My favorite part is actually the pink lemonade. Yet this place is constantly crowded and you have to wait for a seat. We didn't go until 130 today and it was still busy. I get that there hamburger is never frozen but if you can't taste it what's the difference? No matter how many times I take my kids there I am never impressed."}
{"text":"I order a burger protein style and didn't realize how thin the patties are without the bun.  Next time I will order a double double or even a triple if possible.  There were more veggies than meat."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time, burgers and shakes were good but the fries had a different consistency then what I'm use too, maybe mine were old and re-heated. Also didn't like the cheese fries, the cheese was hard. Should have had been a cheesy sauce."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with In N Out. This is my favorite fast food burger joint. Burgers are bomb. This location is pretty busy but they are organized and efficient. If the drive thru starts to get long, youll see one of their friendly staff come out and start to take your order. Double double with onions and animal style fries please!! 1/6/18 This evening the drive thru had about 12 cars in front of me but the wait wasnt too long. Ohhhh and they have a new item this year.....their hot cocoa."}
{"text":"In N Out is always my go to for fast food. Everything is made right after I order so I know it's all fresh. Great customer service as well."}
{"text":"This burger is one of the best burger in America. Hamburg, tomato, onion and lettuce have a great combination and they serve well-organized burger quickly compared to other burger chains. We can enjoy eating the burger safely and beautifully. In addition the shop is cleaned up by the employees every day. I highly recommend to eat good burger in \" in'n out burger\" here."}
{"text":"Haven't had a problem with my orders yet....legit place to eat for a bargain. The menus are simple but the service is slow which is normal. I usually go into the location to place my order if the drive thru line is long."}
{"text":"Out of around 15 In-N-Out's I've been, this one has the best food and service.  In-N-Out consistently provides top service, prices, and food quality in the burger and fries fast food chain market.  In-N-Out seriously needs to review their parking/drive through development.  Half the locations I've been to have some kind of issue.  This In-N-Out is RIDICULOUSLY DIFFICULT TO ENTER/EXIT.  Once you're in the parking lot/drive though area it's ok.  If you're leaving In-N-Out, and planning to head west on Bell (or to the 101), it's almost impossible without a u-turn or separate lot turnaround in high volume traffic.    Despite the driving issues, THIS In-N-Out is SO GOOD I'VE BECOME A REGULAR (2-3 times a month).  I was not an In-N-Out regular before I visited this location."}
{"text":"My husband read there's a secret menu.  So we ordered our 1st 4×4 animal style cheeseburger! My hubby said it was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Oh, I wish there was In-N-Out on the east coast!  I have to get my fix every time I go to Vegas, and the location on Maryland on the edge of the UNLV campus is a great spot if you can get there.  It's not as crowded as the Trop location near the I-15, so you get your double-double and fries much faster.  I get it, In-N-Out won't build a franchise that is more than a day drive from their warehouse so their food stays fresh...or something like that.  But I wish they would break their rule just one time and put one in Boston, specifically across the street from my apartment.  Oh, how I miss you In-N-Out, and I will see you again when I'm back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Nothing taste better than classic hamburger and french fries made fresh at an incredible cheap price. A must stop if you see one."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of In-N-Out, but before coming to this location, I had only dined at the L.A. locations.  So when I was planning my very first trip to Las Vegas, this In-N-Out on the Strip was added to my to-do list.  And the hubs and I weren't going to eat there just once... we planned to go twice.  And we did!  Both times, everything was just as delicious as I remembered from L.A.  Our first visit was around 11:30 am on a Wednesday, and while the restaurant was busy, the line wasn't long yet.  Every table was occupied, but after ordering and paying, the hubs and I only had to stand around for a few minutes until a table opened up.  Most customers know not to linger after finishing their food since In-N-Outs, in general, tend to get busy and full.  As indicated by the restaurant's name, it is not the place to just sit and hang out.  If you are dining in, you don't have to \"rush,\" but please be considerate of those who are waiting for a table.  During our second visit, we got into a long line around 2 pm on a Saturday.  However, the line moved pretty quickly.  While my husband ordered and paid, I went to the dining room and waited patiently by a table that looked like they were finishing up soon.  I was delighted when the two ladies at the table asked if I'd like to use their table when they were done.  Score!  What I've had at this location:  * Cheeseburger ($3.25) - If you're not super hungry, the single patty cheeseburger is a good amount of food.  I always get my burgers with NO onions.  This simple, classic cheeseburger is seasoned perfectly with the right amount of \"spread\" (basically Thousand Island-style sauce) along with lettuce and tomato.  Every ingredient tasted fresh and delicious. * Double-Double ($4.50) - Pretty much ditto what I said about the regular (single patty) cheeseburger, but add an extra patty and an extra slice of cheese for more food and flavor! * Fries ($2.10) - The flavor of their not-so-greasy fries actually reminds me of potato chips!  They're somewhat light and even though they're not the best fast food fries (in my humble opinion), I still think they're tasty and pair perfectly with the amazing burgers!  I don't bother with animal-style (\"secret menu\" item... ask them), protein-style (lettuce instead of buns), or any of the milkshakes.  I've always enjoyed the simple, classic items as they have consistently been good.  Overall, this In-N-Out Burger on the Las Vegas strip gets 5 stars!  Thanks to the friendly and efficient employees, convenient location on the Strip (The LINQ Promenade), and of course - the BEST fast food burgers, the hubs and I thoroughly enjoyed both of our visits to this location.  We'll definitely return whenever we visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is soooo worth the detour when I travel from Phoenix to the East Valley. A very simple menu, delicious burgers, fresh-cut fries, great service. I hope to learn one day what the secret menu is, but until then I'm happy with the things I get from the regular menu."}
{"text":"This is not a review of the Tempe In-N-Out Burger but all of them.  I do not even begin to understand the craze over this place.  You begin with a line that no sane person would actually wait in for a really horrible burger.  Then you get through the line and get your burger.  The sauce they put on those burgers is so SOUR it affected how everything else tasted and ruined the whole meal.  I thought ok, maybe it was just this sandwich.  I tried it again, the lines were LONGER because they had been here about a month longer than the month before, and again the WORST meal on the planet.  The hamburger has just about enough meat to fill a whole in a cavity in your tooth and the sauce is AWFUL.  I will NEVER go here again, even if everyone else in my group is, I'll hie my butt over to Denny's and get a burger with some meat and flavor."}
{"text":"For the LONGEST time this place was getting my order perfect.  And I do order strangely, so that deserves bonus points.  Lately, though, when I go through the drive-thru they ask if I am going to eat it in the car.  Normal.  I say \"No,\" they say, \"OK\" and when I pull up to get my food it's in a box.  Ready to be eaten in a car.  Um.  I don't know what's going on.  Their food is always legit and other than this strange, recent pattern of boxing food (I don't like that because I usually take it home and it can get cold on the way) they still taste awesome.  Just please stop boxing my order when I want it bagged!  -:(  P.S. - Fries well-done, animal style, no cheese.  This is bliss."}
{"text":"If you've been to one In-N-Out Burger, you've been to them all right?  Not quite.  The food is pretty much the same at all of them but the staff at this place, regardless of how busy it gets, are always super friendly.  My coworker who went with me this last time commented on how the young lady at the counter had been working there since she was in high school which must've been about 6 or 7 years.  That is definitely saying something about the management there."}
{"text":"Fries!!!!!  I'm a huge french fries lover. Now adding what they call \"animal style\" on them is a bonus! Grilled onions, cheese, and spread. So delicious! Animal style fries is the only reason I go to in n out for. My fav!"}
{"text":"My husband grew up in Cali so it's definitely nostalgia to have In-N-Out while in Vegas since there's not one in Nashville or anywhere in the South. We had a rental so it made sense to venture off the strip to avoid those extra long lines. This location was perfect, and we got to enjoy a fresh burger and a fresh batch of perfectly fried fries! We had a double animal style, my husband had his with lettuce. It was good! Not the best burger I've had, but definitively tasty! And the cheapest meal we've had in Vegas, lol!"}
{"text":"So my friends and I spent half the day in Vegas walking in 108 degree desert weather only to end up at In-N-Out Burger for dinner before hitting the road back to Los Angeles.   I don't really eat meat anymore so this place would not my first choice but since I was voted out 4 to 1 I went with the majority. We arrive to an overflowing parking like of vagabonds all scurrying inside to get out of the heat to eat.   We barely found a place to park and once inside the scene was chaotic. All registers were opened, lines out the door and hot and irritable people all standing around waiting for their orders with no available tables to sit and enjoy their food.   The poor cashiers were really nice but seemed tired and fatigued. I ordered but feared they would get my very simple order of a classic hamburger w/o tomatoes and fries wrong.   Once my number was called, to my surprise my order was perfect but they have got to do something about the fries... don't like em!  K.J."}
{"text":"I love this In and Out Burger and always visit it when I'm in Vegas. There's no In and Out Burgers where I live and I like going to this one because it's a good excuse to get off the strip and not gamble for a little while."}
{"text":"Food taste like it had been setting a while. French fries are cold and old.  If fresh would have been better.   Place is noisy but it is lunch hour.  The buzzers keep going off.  Very irritating.   Prices are reasonable.  I will give them another try in the future."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Great friendly service. Crowded but the line moved quickly. We ordered the cheeseburger combo and I couldn't eat it all."}
{"text":"Thank you for having the best coffee and for serving Seven-Up!!! Not to mention food is yummy.  Love the Protein Style Hamburger and Well Done Fries"}
{"text":"Oh In-N-Out, what happened to your French fries?    Whenever I travel to AZ, In-N-Out is a must have for this displaced SoCal boy.  Double Double with raw onions, thick chocolate shake, and fries.....oh wait....what happened to the fries???  The freshly cut taters deep fried to a perfect golden brown used to be a symphony in your mouth.   The last two times the fries have tasted like a \"coagulated flavorless starch bi-product\", including animal fries.     BRING BACK THE DELICIOUS FRIES!  All in all, In-N-Out is a good place to strap on a great tasting feed bag at a reasonable price.    Go, enjoy, delight in this wonderful burger place, and maybe, just maybe, the fries will get better."}
{"text":"Cheap, hot, delicious, burgers....served up fast and friendly. Who DOESN'T like In-N-Out? Make mine mustard grilled and protein style with a rootbeer float and extra salt on the fries. And add an extra point for being open until 1am in the lobby!"}
{"text":"In n out.... how do other fast food hamburger joints even stay in business with in n out in town. They are so much better than any other place it isn't even funny. They have a very good \"secret menu\" for those who arnt frequent visitors, a quick google search will tell you all you need to know.   The staff is always very friendly and the service is fast! Did they mess something up? It's rare but it happens but they always make it up to you. I prefer just he standard double double meal with cheese fry's. If you are crazy enough to have never heard of in n out do yourself a favor and go in, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"This place is horrible the service is trash the manager is unprofessional I got to the drive thru at 1:30 am because ive been hearing my wife nagging me all day about animal fries all she wanted was one animal fry. We get to the speaker and get totally ignored now we're so far deep into it that we have to go to telhe window. well on the way to the window everybody was looking at us like we were some crazy people. Eventually we end up at the second window and get ignored like we never existed I talked to the manager explained everything and they couldnt even make us 1 animal fries its not like if they served us theyd have to serve the people behind us because THERE WAS NOBODY BEHIND US we were the last people in the drive thru! They were purely unprofessional and will never go again!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of fast food, but YUM!!!!!! Only problem you have to take that last bite."}
{"text":"yes 2 stars. Fries were cold and hard, and burger seemed EHH.  I dont have these where I live so I was excited to get one. They did give my dog a patty which I thought was cool. BUT the fries killed it for me and the burger just seemed off."}
{"text":"Simple but deliciously fresh burgers and fries made to order!  The patties are simple and thin, but then again they don't make you feel lethargic afterwards. The fries are so fresh and tasty, and you can put your own salt on them or not. They should cook them a little longer to be crispier to be even better. We forgot to order one burger without sauce for Grandma, and they graciously made her a new one at no charge. Friendly and efficient service."}
{"text":"Went into the drive thru at around 10:15 pm and there were no cars and no one in line in the store. It took them around 15 minutes to make us our food. There were plenty of workers messing around in there not doing anything. I only ordered one burger and fries, so it shouldn't have taken long at all. Disappointed with this service."}
{"text":"I honestly do not understand peoples infatuation with this place.  The fries are terrible and the burgers are barely edible.  I have tried several In-N-Out Burgers to make a fair assessment, and they're all nasty."}
{"text":"We LOVE In & Out Burger, and have NEVER had a problem with the service at ANY OTHER location...EVER! However, at this location, I have driven through the drive through just for a Dr. Pepper, and I have never gotten my order right yet! How hard is a Large Dr, Pepper???? I mean REALLY?!?! Both times, I drive up & am given a medium...when I politely inform the workers that I ordered a Large, I am asked, \"Oh, would you like to upgrade that?\" and then was asked for the $$$ difference!!! The last time I was there, I did, again politely, tell the employee that I ordered a Large Dr. Pepper, he disagreed and basically implied that I was not telling the truth, it is my mistake, and said that according to the receipt that I ordered a medium, and one again, asked if I wanted to upgrade for an extra charge. WOW, did he really think I didnt know what I ordered, like I just forgot? I really should not written this, no big deal right? I guess I am still just annoyed. That is ok, there are pleny of other In & Out  Burgers to go to! ;)"}
{"text":"Only giving it the stars because of how great other locations are but this is the worst In N Out in Vegas. They have messed up my order three times in a row. The girl who has worked the second window the last few evenings has made me not want to go back as well. I wish I knew her name. She's really pretty, mixed, but with the worst attitude. I used to love going to In N out cause everyone is so nice but service/food just keeps getting worse. Every other In N Out has the best people, food comes out perfect, and they never mess up orders. This location is slacking."}
{"text":"Food was good. Location was clean. Staff was nice. It's a little more expensive than the regular in n outs but it's in the middle of the strip so it makes sense. It's still super affordable."}
{"text":"I live in Southern California and go here about 6x a year. Stopped in the Vegas location with a family member while on a road trip to Utah. She got the protein burger and I got the double double. The protein burger looked like someone had sat on it, but my double double was good.  Both tasted good. The fries looked old and dry which is surprising with how busy it was. We threw most of them away. The SoCal locations are on point atleast in San Diego, I won't be back to the Vegas one."}
{"text":"This was the first location we tried In-N-Out and fell in love!!  We definitely have gone at least 2-3 times when we visit Vegas. Animal style everything is so amazing!! I wish there were 24 hour locations! I see now there is one on the strip, which I'm super stoked about. I never took any pictures because I devour the food as soon as it comes!"}
{"text":"In & Out burger is the best fast food burger joint ever. Love the \"spread\" or whatever it is they slab across the burger. I imagine this spread is similar to Kel's secret sauce from Good burger. I always order my onions chopped vs grilled so the onions soak up the spread."}
{"text":"Fast clean service rendered by fast clean employees in a fast clean restaurant. Most folks in American can't get this, but we can! Forget the \"secret menu\" and just go in for the kill with a double double and shake. Can't be beat for service price, taste or quality..."}
{"text":"Ate here a few days ago. I love the burgers here and never had a problem there until now. I even wrote a 5 star review of this place previously. After eating here the night of march 16th, I woke up the next morning and noticed some stomach cramps. by the mid afternoon the cramps got really bad. After a few hours I was puking my guts out and having extreme diarrhea. I am still not back to normal from this.  I remember when looking at the hamburger patty seeing a bit of pink, however at the time I thought it could of been a piece of tomato. Could be the patties are undercooked or who knows what could of gone wrong. Either way, after most of the puking had subsided,  I decided to stop by and tell the manager what happened so they could have a heads up in case there was a contamination or if someone was not frying the patties all the way. Talked to the manager and was totally blown off. Was told it was not possible for me to get food poisoning at In-N-Out, it was just not something that could happen there and that I must of gotten it somewhere else.   I was not very happy that I got food poisoning, but hey, people make mistakes, I thought I would at least give them a heads up so they could eliminate future problems. I can forgive for an honest mistake. But no, I was treated like a total idiot and was given a total BS response. Absolutely no concern or effort was put forth when it comes to food safety, not even a \"Sucks that happened, I'll talk to the cooks and make sure the patties are not getting undercooked\".   So yeah, I like their burgers, I am not so liking being food poisoned by them, I can forgive though. However I am MAD that when you bring a food safety issue to their attention they will not even admit to the possibility it could of been them or at the very least make a token effort to PREVENT possible future cases. If that is how their managers act, it has really lowered my opinion of that entire business."}
{"text":"Always pretty good. I waltzed in and tried to order a Big Mac, but Austin (the cashier) just stared at me. I settled for the cheeseburger with grilled onions instead--Austin was a good sport and offered me stickers and a hat to go with it.   It was just like a typical In-in-Out, cheap and only a few options. If you know the secrets though, you can make 6 choices become 60. No joke.   + Try the Neapolitan Shake (all three flavors mixed).  + Ask for a side of jalapeño peppers if you're feeling spicy. If you're feeling extra risqué, ask for them chopped up on your burger.  + Animal style (both burger and fries).  + Protein style (wrapped in lettuce instead of on a bun).  + Grilled cheese.  + Ask for pickles on your burger.  + Dip your fries in \"spread\"--ask for it when you pick up your meal at the counter.   Again, the employees were great, the restaurant was clean, and we beat the rush; so no one was hovering at my table waiting to snatch it as I finished licking my fingers clean.   TIPS & TRICKS:  * If it is busy (which it usually is) have someone scout out a place to sit while you're in line.  * It's hot here, so unless you feel like melting, sit inside.  * In-n-Out's root beer is definitely a force to be reckoned with. Try it."}
{"text":"I came to in and out for a burger and I normally get a lettuce wrap this time aside to treat myself and get a bun my surprise the bun was a little soggy highly disappointed would not recommend"}
{"text":"So this place is already the epitome of a great west coast burger and the consistent taste keeps me running back for more. I'm very happy that there are so much more locations in the valley compared when I was a kid back then. Almost there's most likely an in and out available nearby. I order what depends on my mood and it's either a protein style double double or grilled onions instead. I actually didn't really like In N Out as much as I do now and it's so addicting.  If you don't know the secret menu here, you're missing out. Reevaluate your life."}
{"text":"I hadn't had food from here in years since visiting CA but I was super happy to find one on the strip. Delicious food, it was super packed but I didn't mind waiting. Good prices compared to other places on the strip"}
{"text":"For fast food burgers, this is indeed quite good. This location is a welcome shot in the arm for Metro Square and the MetroCenter area. The burgers and fries were good, the service friendly and quite fast. Four and a half stars, but I'm bumping it up to 5 because the staff was able to manage the madness of opening day well - including the long queue of cars at the drive-thru."}
{"text":"What do you do right before embarking on a 5 hour drive back to California?? Go through the In-N-Out drive thru of course!  I was pleasantly surprised by how efficient the staff runs this location. The line was not abhorrently long and it went by quickly. Service was good. They made the BEST chocolate shake I've ever had at an In-N-Out location.   Only downside is the nasty taste of cold fries. And it doesn't take very long for them to get cold! Also didn't like how the lettuce disappeared halfway through my burger :/ It was alright for the price, but I'll be sticking with SoCal locations."}
{"text":"I'm an In-N-Out lover, but the reason I took the time to rate this location was because the service was stellar. Most locations are friendly but this loc the staff went above and beyond. Clean, too!"}
{"text":"I am from Miami so we don't have these in and out burgers in Florida  Anthony Bpurdaine made such a big deal about dying for an in and out burger when he is overseas traveling, I thought, wow, I need to try this place. The menu has 4-5 things listed but they don't tell you about the so called animal fries or mention any of the toppings that you can get besides lettuce tomato and mayonnaise. I'm not a big eater so I ordered the single and the thickness of the hamburger patty was microscopic. Now I understand why people order the double. But even the double is still very very thin. I will never go back there again. I'm sticking to Guy Fieri's  burger as the top burger on the planet. I refuse to pay five dollars for loaded fries so I went across  the street to Popeyes and got the $2 seasoned  fries and I was happy as a clam"}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, tasty burgers with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and onions.  What more do you want?  Well, I would like salt on the fries, but it's not that much of a pain to add the salt myself.  I guess.....  I've always had friendly service, even when dithering between menu options!"}
{"text":"Awesome food but if you get animal style on the burger/cheeseburger, it's free! If you get animal style on the fries, it is a $2.05 mark up for an upgrade... Wth? That's ridiculous! I could understand $.50 or $1 but $2.05???? Crazy!!  I just got my food and they got my order wrong... Jeez"}
{"text":"An older gentleman that works here named Andrew, is the model employee for any fast food. Energetic, polite, fast, and efficient. Always a pleasure dealing with him."}
{"text":"The most mediocre and disappointing burger experience in a restaurant ever. I suppose the hype about this place (especially after seeing The Big Lebowski) built it up to be a transcendental experience didn't help matters much. The long wait makes matters worse. Here it is: The burger; OK, not much to it, nothing flavorful or special. Big Boy in the old days was 10 times better. The fries were the most pitiful sight I've seen, the taste (or lack of ) was worse. I forced myself to consume them, but after several fries gave up. Not hot, not crispy, no substance, just awful.  Save your money and go to Culver's to experience a real greasy burger."}
{"text":"OK, so I've upgraded this experience to 2 stars, but it still probably only deserves a 1.5, which is better than last time.   The burger was actually pretty good this time, and the wait wasn't that bad. Again, this is not a great burger by any means and on any given day you could experience a whopper junior that has more flavor.  When the girl asked if I wanted fries, I responded \" Are they still the same thin, soggy, greasy, flavorless, nothing fries or have you changed your recipe to make decent fries? She just smiled and said they were the same, so I said, \"no thanks\".  In and Out is obviously a Southwest thing. Anyone who is from the Midwest or East Coast expects restaurants to rise above mediocrity, but mediocrity, unfortunately, is what passes for \"great food\" in Arizona."}
{"text":"Simply simple and tasty. Luckily the fast food chain is open late since we arrived later in the evening after our flight. Surprisingly, the drive thru line was still long at about 11 PM at night, but that still did not stop us.  I ordered the double double burger with fries and my friend ordered the same except with just lettuce, no buns. Just a classic burger with no frills. I just love how simple the menu is and the food is super affordable and may I say: cheap!  Totally wish Honolulu had an In & Out!"}
{"text":"Frequent this In-N-Out when I'm in AZ for work. Good location because it's off the freeway. Can get busy during the day, but late night is your best bet (after 10 PM, it's usually empty inside and sure beats room service). Service is always good and I love the customization/quality-driven mentality at In-N-Out. Always get a double/double animal style, animal fries, and a lemonade. If I feel like I'll actually go to the hotel gym that night, might even treat myself to a Neapolitan.   For some reason (maybe because I usually go at night), I've seen prom/tolo groups of high school students on several occasions. I always have a chuckle when I see dressed up students scarfing down double-doubles and animal fries."}
{"text":"No need to be coy. I love visiting you every time I'm in Vegas. I wish we could be closer. I love you!"}
{"text":"I mean, is In-N-Out Burger ever worthy of anything below 5 stars for what you get?! I think not. The prices are SO inexpensive and it is still one of the best tasting burgers ever. When this location opened about a year ago (or maybe a little more) I was SO excited because it is closer to my house than Tempe. For $5.95, you can get a cheeseburger, fries, and fountain drink. YOU GUYS, this is cheaper than McDonald's and WAY more fresh! Why would you go anywhere else!? Not only that, it is a mouth-watering burger and FRESH fries made from real potatoes and not scary ingredients like most fast food joints! :)   My go-to is the #2 single cheeseburger meal (ANIMAL STYLE: mustard-fried, extra pickles, and grilled onions) with fries! IT IS THE BOMB. I literally dream about it. When i'm feeling healthy, i'll get it protein-style which is wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun. It is worth noting that In-N-Out is the only burger chain that has successfully done protein-style where it is easy(ish) to eat. In my experience, at least. LOVE.   Anywho, this location is always quick and friendly. We'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Fast food fast service and at a competitive cost!  The place was clean and the location wasn't hard to find!"}
{"text":"Always friendly service, our order is always correct, and the food is always good. My only complaint is that the parking lot/drive thru is a pain. It's not set up very well."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru...I thought I was in luck because it was not busy and ordered a double double and a cheese burger.   I was excited and fat boy happy...it had been many months since I've had a delicious In and Out Burger!  I got home about 10 minutes later and both burgers were not even luke warm...it was so disappointing. I'm sure they would of both probably tasted great an hour earlier when they were first made, then left for me to foolishly order. The taste was Bleh.  *note to self* when ordering fast food Burgers add something unusual to make sure they make it fresh like extra sauce or pickles or cheese or grilled onions so they can't just hand you one that has been sitting around for a long time."}
{"text":"What is the hype! This place is madness, there's a line to order, tables are full, no place to wait for your food. We had the double double with animal sauce (think its pretty much thousand island with ketchup) and the burger was fine but no better than Five Guys. Fries were fresh cut but no different and if anything could've used another minute in the fryer. Milkshakes were super thick and impossible to drink with a straw. At least they don't take advantage of their popularity by raising prices."}
{"text":"in the immortal words of the Bangles:  If you want to find all the cops, They're hanging out in the In-N-Out. They sing and dance (Oh-Way-Oh) They spin their clock and cruise on down the block   at least I think that is how it goes now =P Seriously they had about 4-5 squad cars here when I swung through late at night with a friend to get something on the way back to SURPRISE where we were staying. It is awesome that they are always open late.   Pro Tip: Do not try and rob this location. You are likely to find more cops than in a doughnut shop grubben or chillaxen here!  The grub was pretty tasty. Exactly what you would expect from In-N-Out. The double double was tasty. I stole some fries from my friend since I didnt wanna eat a lot of them. Carb overload on the fries ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh... i can feel the fat growing even now from the carbs...   This place is tasty and worth a stop. Its everything you could want in a quick burger and is the only \"fast food\" joint just about that I will eat at on rare occasion. Enjoy it, it is tasty."}
{"text":"Ah In-N-Out Burger, my own little burger heaven that I miss so dearly from the cold East coast.  I had to go to In-N-Out Burger as my final meal in Vegas. I got into my cab and told him \"The closest In-N-Out Burger to the airport please.\" His reaction was less than enthusiastic but I am the customer and I get what I want (within reason of course).   I walked in with suitcase and carry-on in arm, went straight up to the cashier and ordered my college favorite:  Cheeseburger Animal Style WITH whole grilled onions, fries and a chocolate milkshake.  (Which is about... what, probably one million calories? To quote almost every rapper out there, \"I don't give a ____!\")  I don't care how long I've lived in NYC for, I still love my In-N-Out so much. The fries are just so fresh. Onions grilled and caramelized. Animal sauce dripping everywhere. Shake so thick that it's really hard to suck out through my straw.... uh hem. All of this quality I can taste and it only came out to $6.38... TAKE THAT SHAKE SHACK.  Fifteen minutes of foodgasms later and I was ready to leave for the airport.   Till next time In-N-Out, I love you and miss you already.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- My personal side story:   If you are a visiting out of towner, do not do what I did. I honestly thought I was going to miss my flight because I had a cab drop me off here so I could enjoy my burger in peace. Unbeknownst to me that unlike NYC, Vegas cabs are not allowed to be hailed on the side of the road... So here I  am waiting at an In-N-Out for a cab that I called in because I could not for the life of me get any of the cabs driving by to pull over on this random road.  15 minutes passes... nothing.  I call the cab company and they said they have NO record of my request so I resubmit it.  Then another 15 minutes...  Then another 30 minutes...  At this point I have been waiting for a cab for an hour, my flight is in an hour and I am freaking the f*** out!!!  Luckily one man dropping off someone else earlier saw me and actually came back to get me. Thank you taxi man!!! Ironically enough my flight ended up being delayed TWO HOURS because of the one thunderstorm that happens once a summer in Vegas... so everything was fine.  So there, that was my full In-N-Out Burger story from Vegas. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Last time I was at In-N-Out burger was a couple of years ago.  My nephew and niece really wanted to go to In-N-Out for dinner a couple of weeks ago.  So, we decided to go.  I'm glad we went, because I got my favorite burger, animal style with single meat."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and this time was a little disappointing. The Double-double was good but the fries felt undercooked and the waiting time was long at 13 minutes for my order. I will go back there again to hopefully better fries and shorter wait times next time."}
{"text":"Ehhhhhhh. Overhyped in my opinion. I've tried it a couple of times at a couple of different locations but came away with the same impression: burgers - nothing special, good but not great; shakes - same; fries - meh. I'll give it another shot the next time I'm in Scottsdale and try to remember to order off the \"secret\" menu. Maybe that's where the really good stuff is."}
{"text":"maybe its just me. I feel like I am about to jump into a fire here, but i didn't like it at all. the burger tasted cheap, and they just threw thousand island dressing on everything. I tasted beyond average. I mean I am glad they have a cult following and all, but once was just fine for me."}
{"text":"This is my favorite location. Not only bc it's close to our house, but bc it's NEVER packed and so you get your food quickly. The employees are always nice and friendly, just like at any other In N Out, but it's just so much better than say, the one off Dean Martin that's always packed with all the riff raff from the Strip!  Are these the best burgers in the world? Well, not really, but where else can you get two burgers and an order of fries for less than $8?  Way cheaper than McD's and your food is cooked fresh to order and you get it hot! Unlike McD's where the cheese isn't even melted 99% of the time.  I used to not be an In N Out fan, but compared to other fast food places, really how can you complain about it? You can't compare them to other $6-8 per burger joints. I mean Smashburger is right across the street, and it's good, but it's more than double the price."}
{"text":"I have been waiting so long for my In and Out burger. I have been hearing about this West coast chain for ages. Everyone talks about how GREAT it is - \"It's the best burger in the world\" - \"You will never have such as good burger in your life\" - \"I travel to the West coast just for this burger.\" So when I found out that there was one a couple of blocks away from the convention center I was working in, I was beyond ecstatic. I just had to get there. So I dragged two of my co-workers to In and Out to grab a \"burger and fries\". It was amazing. Out of this world. The best burger I ever had. Etc. Etc. Other than that, I really can't say much. If you never had it - You NEED/HAVE to experience it. If you had - you don't need any other explanation. It's just that good!"}
{"text":"This is the best fast food experience you can have. Period.  Having recently been to a bunch of burger places I felt I was ready to see where In-N-Out would rank. I ordered a double double animal style, fries, and a strawberry shake. Every one of those items was outstanding.  First off, the restaurant is very clean despite being completely packed. All the staff were nice and helpful, not a surly employee in sight. I was impressed at how quickly the line moved and that the wait for the food itself was short considering I was here at the height of the lunch rush.  My burger was fantastic. Extremely flavorful on its own, but in tandem with the cheese, sauce, veggies, and bun everything came alive. I think the meat patties at Shake Shack may be a *little* bit better, but the superior bun and sauce more than make up the gap for In-N-Out. The fries were perfectly cooked and the shake was the epitome of a strawberry shake.  Here's the real kicker though- the price. This is the location right by the Vegas strip. Having ordered basically the same thing at Shake Shack I was prepared for a $20 price tag. But no! It  came out to $8 and change! You simply cannot get a better deal for your money.  Is In-N-Out a reason to move out West on its own? No, but it's certainly a start."}
{"text":"Usually i love this location. They're accurate and quick. Yesterday i went through the drive through and ordered a Double Double and paid for it. When i arrived to pickup my order the cashier ready me back a single burger order. I let her know it was supposed to be a Double Double. She turned to a co-worker and let him know my burger was wrong. Instead of correcting it, they placed another box top over the box bottom hiding their mistake. It was very disspointing. Simple fix, but to go out of your way to hide it?? Just hope a manager reads this ans addresses it."}
{"text":"Animal style - grilled onions and sauce, yummy! Fries are always the best. This burger joint does it best, hands down, at almost every location. This one didn't disappoint and of course I ate there more than once on my short stay nearby.  Their short menu - just burgers, fries, drinks (shakes!), quick service even when 20 are before you, and tasty wholesome ingredients make this the best eatin in town, in their limited west coast locations.  If you are bored or need some inspiration, check out the psalms on paper goods.  This isn't just some heartless fast food chain!"}
{"text":"Always love In-N-Out. Although their burgers have shrunk over the years, it's still a great and quick place to grab a meal on the go. With Shake Shack and other yummy burger places competing, their lines are still long which means they have a great following. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Sorry but In-N-Out is over hyped! I know it's a west coast thing, so I get it, but I can't hype up the mediocre burgers and fries. I had tried them years ago in LA, but had forgotten how I liked them, so got the opportunity to try them again while in Vegas for a conference with coworkers.   It gets pretty busy but once we got our food I was excited to dig in. I got a cheeseburger animal style and cheese fries. I'm a big lover of fries and love some good cheese fries. Unfortunately these disappointed. I thought the cheese would be more of a liquid texture, like good cheese fries should be. Instead the cheese was melted hard on top of he fries so everything was stuck together and impossible to spread around. Even alone the fries just weren't good, which really sucks. The burger however was better but still nothing to write a great review about.   I really wanted to love everything but it just didn't do it for me. Maybe I should have went to Shake Shack instead..."}
{"text":"Totally typical In-N-Out burger location....  It was easy and fast to order and quick to get our meal.  The burger tasted just like it was supposed to.  So did the fries.  Service was friendly and fast.  Prices are inexpensive for what you get.  This location is a good representation of the chain."}
{"text":"Hey, an In-N-Out finally won me over. That's because this location solved the two major problems I have with the chain: ridiculous wait times and terrible fries. Both much better here than anywhere else I've ever been.   Being right next to UNLV I'm certain during the day and during semesters the place is slammed. But if you go during semester breaks, or later at night (the lobby is open until 1AM every night) crowds and wait times are actually surprisingly minimal. Usually no line and you get your food in only a few minutes.   And I don't know if this is just at this location, or the chain has stepped up their game, but the fries seem considerably less crappy and burnt. Still not among the best fries out there but good enough to round out the meal."}
{"text":"I really can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet. In-N-Out is near and dear to my heart. This is a five star burger joint for a few specific, simple reasons.  1. They are open til 1am inside, which is awesome, especially after getting out of a sporting event late at night with friends.  2. A Double-Double is an American Classic and one damn good cheeseburger, nothing beats it.  3. They have the simplest menu on earth, which means the food is incredibly fresh because all they make is burgers and french fries, which happen to be the most perfect combination ever.  Yeah, it's pretty straight forward here. There is nothing better than a Double Double with a handful of their fresh cut fries washed down with a shake or ice cold Dr Pepper or Coke. Theyre open late, the food is amazing, and incredibly affordable. You can easily get meals for two people for $10. There's a reason any location you go to is always busy. We all love In-N-Out, and luckily we live on the west coast so we can enjoy it whenever we feel!"}
{"text":"As a past employee of INO, I could be pretty in-depth with expectations. I absolutely love this location. Everyone is always friendly, it's always clean, service is as fast as they can...it's hard to not eat here every day!"}
{"text":"As a former INO employee, this location makes me a bit sad. Granted, they do have long lines that are taken care of as best as possible. I don't come here too often, but 2 times ago I had a hair wrapped in my DD, last time I had a ton of fry chips that made up about half of my fry boat & this time I only ordered a cheeseburger animal t p whgr instead & received a cheeseburger wo after waiting about 20 min in line. Also, the tables are always dirty when we eat inside. Maybe I've had bad luck, but seven years as an employee & visiting just about every store in town makes me think otherwise sometimes."}
{"text":"I graduated with a degree in Hotel Management, and one of my classes, Food and Beverage 101 had a case study on In-N-Out. Serious. And me, being a New Yorker, never had the pleasure of savoring one of these freshly made burgers... until a recent work trip to Vegas!   Fo'reals, didn't know one existed in Vegas (if I had known, I would've been there every day vs just a few hours before my flight out!).   Thanks Leah R. for the tip on the walk from Excalibur - it was literally only 15 minutes! And the walk made me work up my appetite. Good times! Leah R.'s directions: \"Tip: you CAN walk here from the strip. Just walk down the sidewalk on the Excalibur side of the street across the freeway bridge entrance area and under another little bridge and you're there. It's like a 15 minute walk.\"   Had my double-double animal style with a vanilla milkshake to wash it all down. Seriously, I have to say... it really was the best burger I've ever had. The melding of flavors was seriously awesome. And if I wasn't with a group of people... I could've thrown down another double-double, but didn't want to look too much like a pig!   Seriously - go. And my $6 dinner was the cheapest meal I had during my entire trip in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I love this places cheeseburgers drinks and fries. They have great service and overall great prices. Delicious food  and love to go there"}
{"text":"The chain needs no introduction but I was honestly slightly let down from this location. My double double today was served room temperature & they also forgot my coffee, which required an additional 5 minutes of waiting even after I got my burger. My friend's fries were also not quite hot. Not sure if it was the crazy rush but overall we were both disappointed which is highly unusual for the chain!! I don't get to enjoy in'n'out too often, had high hopes for my lunch, maybe too high!"}
{"text":"In-n-out is for sure one of my favorite burger joints! Their use of fresh ingredients is what makes this place so awesome! Not to mention great customer service :) If you haven't been to In-n-out make sure to get yourself a double double and fries animal style, it will change your life.   This location in particular is generally busy as it's right on Nellis and in a busy shopping plaza. Service moves pretty quickly but you should expect some sort of a wait since everything is scratch made and fresh. As always good food takes time!"}
{"text":"I recently visited your In N Out location at approximately 11:51pm on June 16th, 2017. I briefly spoke with Alyssa about what I would like to purchase. Specifically, I ordered milk (which was delicious), an extra large Root Beer float (for some reason they put it in a large cup, which doesn't make any sense), a double double plain which was meh to say the least, and a side of cheese which never arrived. So, the culprit of this letter is the side of loose cheese that I didn't receive. Now, I paid hard earned money on some loose cheese and never got to enjoy it's taste. I didn't want to cause a scene about my cheese, but I definitely feel lied to. If someone could please contact me about the great cheese heist of 2017, I'd like to talk about it. That, or I will contact my lawyer and demand more cheese. (Lawyers are on retainer so legal fees are not a problem for me)."}
{"text":"Nathan or nathia I cant remember his name. That was working the drive through this evening was amazing. Very friendly. It was a nice touch after my long commute home."}
{"text":"Always good burgers, what was preventing from a five star was my fries we're overdone! But in n out is always a go to spot for burgers...."}
{"text":"Yuck!!! If you only do burgers and fries, the fries should be delicious. These tasted like cardboard. I don't know how you make a potato taste that bad."}
{"text":"Great location. Can't really go wrong with in n out. Customer service is always top notch.  Place can be crowded and loud but always clean and you will get taken care of. Open late so great for after all day events to treat yourself."}
{"text":"Stopped for a milkshake. My son sees the logo and always asks for a milkshake. Nothing really bad to say about in n out. Originally from California so I've been accustomed and prefer in n out when it comes to my burgers and fries. Shakes are great also. Staff is ALWAYS super friendly and smiling."}
{"text":"Wonderful and simple burger with very good price! The place is clean. Good ice tea with lemon.. it's rare in fountain drinks :)"}
{"text":"It's always busy here for good reason but don't let the long lines scare you because it actually moves pretty quick! The food here is amazing as always but the efficient staff makes it 5 stars"}
{"text":"The best.  The food is on point t and the young kids working there really hustle.  There's always a wait but they work hard to get you \"in and out\"."}
{"text":"As I've sat back and watched a debate unfold before me -both online and in person-  in regards to the \"Which is better?\" Shake Shack vs. In-N-Out Burger fight, I was always a little miffed that I didn't really have a dog in the fight. I was also upset that I don't use the word \"miffed\" anywhere near as much as it deserves to be used. So imagine my surprise and happiness when I found out that In-N-Out has an outpost in Vegas.  In case you can't imagine it, it was kind of anticlimactic in that I didn't jump around or throw midgets in celebration. I was just really happy while sitting in a moving car.  So, which is better? Subjectively, I would still say Shake Shack. The girl, however, who does not like any hamburger ever created, ate 75% of my Animal Style burger in the time it took me to take a sip of my milkshake (Neopolitan, because you have to order off the menu anytime you're given the opportunity in life). She then spent the rest of the trip, and nearly every day up to the time I'm writing this review, complaining that she hasn't had another one, but what does she know?"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fast food fan -- but I spent some time in LA when I worked for Yahoo! and I fell in LOVE with In-n-Out burger.  THANK GOD there are none in Chicago or I'd be 7000 lbs.  I went twice when I was in Las Vegas -- once for dinner with my sister and then again on the way to the airport -- yes, we had a cabbie take us through the drive through.  I am not a fan of the fries at all -- so I skipped those, but the burgers are RIDICULOUS. Yummmmmmmmmmmmyyyyyyyyyyyyy.  It's not really even fast food -- everything is fresh and never frozen and just so damn good.    It was my sister's first time at In-n-Out and she is one hard to please cookie -- she LOVED it.    I can't wait to be back in Vegas -- I may have to stop right when I get off the plane.  Which makes me think .... why don't they put one in the airport??? GENIUS IDEA if I do say so myself."}
{"text":"First timer! I've been hearing the hype about this place for years, but rarely venture to West Coast. I can't believe it took so many years! The burgers and fries lived up to my expectations 100%! Animal Style is the way to go. Ultimate Vegas hangover food."}
{"text":"It is a great fast food restaurant.  the staff are always amazing and the food is really good.  Get the burger animal style and get the shakes.  They only do a few items but they do them well."}
{"text":"I don't know why but I regularly crave In-N-Out fries late on a Saturday night.  They are always packed so prepare to spend some time getting your order whether you go inside or take advantage of the drive-through.    But regardless of how busy they are I have never not seen an employee without a smile on their face.  So I wait patiently for my tasty late night treat."}
{"text":"Love this In 'n Out. I live in the DC area where Five Guys started and they aren't even in the same league as In 'n Out. Five guys is so greasy from the burgers to the fries. The only thing Five Guys has going for it is the peanuts. This location is a little slow, but they do an excellent job and the people working there are really nice. I get the triple animal style with no bun and extra cooked fries. The shakes are great too. I got strawberry, but read another review where you can get it Neopolitan style which I will definitely get next time. I so wish we had this place back east because I would eat here at least once a week. I had the little peppers too, but they were a little too hot for me, but I ate them anyway because I like peppers. Will probably hit this place on the way to the airport on my way home. Yes, it's that damn good!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with. Double double animal style. Love eating here. We can't get these up in Oregon. Not sure how much a review helps this place they stand on their own. Got a love them"}
{"text":"in-N-out will always serve the greatest burger the only complaint i have is with the fries at times not being cook enough . so i have learn to ask for extra crispy and they are just right"}
{"text":"This place is a working man's heaven, selling burgers under $5.   Unfortunately, there are only burgers at this burger joint! It seems like an oxymoron, but with most burger places offering chicken/vegetarian sandwiches, I was a bit surprised to find the rigidity of the menu. But, if you don't mind the impasse, then shoot for the burgers. Burgers are OK, fries are OK. The little banana peppers are delicious though..."}
{"text":"Everything was fine till the cashier charged me for the wrong order at the window. The manager refunded me but in the same breath STILL charged me for the meal I originally ordered. That would've been a time for some free food but they charged me. Yup not really wanting In-N-Out for a while."}
{"text":"Love the chain, hate the poor slow service at this location. Why do I have to wait 13 minutes for 5 cars in front of me? Drive through isn't intended to be a parking spot. Mgmt needs to wake up!!"}
{"text":"The best burgers you can get outside a fancy restaurant! Double double with onions, Animal fries, and a shake. Can't beat that. Always fresh & delicious! The only downside to In-N-Out, you always have to wait. They're soooo busy, you can never get In-N-Out, Ha! you see what I did there."}
{"text":"Everyone knows how good In-n-Out is, but this was probably the most pathetic burger I've ever received from here. It literally look (and tasted) like an old McDonald's burger sitting on the counter too long. Edit: got incredibly sick from this meal, should've known not to eat this old burger"}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and I've stopped at In-N-Out like 5x already and it's been great service every. Single. Time. The food is so yummy. The have friendly and fast service! Will be returning for sure! :)  My onlyyy complaint (which honestly isn't really a complaint) is that the drive through lane is tight so my truck (a lifted dodge) doesn't fit but whatevs! First world problems lol."}
{"text":"First time getting food from In n Out. Service was absolutely horrible for the drive thru. Waited 30 minutes in the line. Cashier crumpled up and threw away my receipt before I could ask for it, received the wrong order, and on top of that when I checked my change after realizing I was given the wrong items my money back was off!! The only upside to this was that when I called in to tell them what happened they comp'd me for the meal. Phone call service was A-1 honestly and probably the only reason I would ever go back."}
{"text":"Every time I come here during lunch (around noon), it's always busy. Really busy!!!  Even though the line is almost out the door, the service is pretty quick. All you non-west coast people must stop by In-N-Out and get anything in the menu.  It's amazeballs."}
{"text":"What can I say. It's in and out Burger. It's the best burger with the freshest ingredients made from scratch made the way you want. I always enjoy the 4x4 animal style with the neopolitan shakes but tonight I opted to have triple triple instead. Don't bother looking for it in the menu coz it's not listed. Just come up with what you want and they will make it."}
{"text":"It is another fast food place one can get a burger. I do not understand the overly zealous like for the food. Yes the inside of the store is nice and clean and the employees are actually smiling and understand the menu, but considering the limited choices on the menu I guess this is not truly an amazing feat.  But nice just the same. The burgers and fries are ok, nothing to rave about. I did discover that they should be eaten there as these items do not travel well. By the time we got ours home they were just yucky."}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars if it didn't have so much grease. Other than that, I love hamburgers!  I always MUST get an in-n-out burger whenever I'm in Cali or Vegas. Hamburger, animal style please :)"}
{"text":"Love this joint! Friendly staff and delicious food! It's at a great location! My son loves the little cups and ketchup pump! We have been eating here since it opened and have had a good experience every time!"}
{"text":"In N Out is always a good choice--but this location is always dropping the ball. Every time I go, something gets forgotten or it comes dine-in for takeout. The people are nice and friendly, but the overall experience suffers because of how long it takes to get your food! Oh yeah, and somebody need to mop."}
{"text":"This location is always jam freaking packed, regardless on the time of day...advice here is to get to this location as early as possible (take the Flamingo from the bus stop outside NYNY, and you get dropped off across the street--USE THE CROSSWALK!!)  I get the same thing everytime--Double Double Animal Style Combo...service is generally quick, and you can see the freshness of the stuff used to make the burgers..  Be patient...sometimes lines are long, but the end result is so very worth it...  At this location next door is a full line of In and Out stuff including T shirts and all sorts of happy things...the magnet set has a proud place on my freezer door at home..."}
{"text":"Life has very few experiences that will bring you overwhelming joy. The birth of your children? Getting married? Landing your dream job? None of those will compare to the first time you have a double-double. The journey to get here will be long, arduous and bursting with mediocrity, but when you finally see that sign, a sense of relief washes over you as you've finally reached the illusive end.  The wait you're likely to encounter in the restaurant is but a minor inconvenience so savor the experience. Watch the staff behind the counter as they work in their matching white uniforms...the kid chopping potatoes for fries, the two guys putting the burgers together coolly with perfect efficiency and the helpful cashier leading everyone to their desired meal. When you get your food please take a minute to thank whichever deity you happen to worship that you're alive to enjoy what's about to happen.   The first bite will change you. Make you a better person. And makes a good reward for a life well lived."}
{"text":"Bon burger! On ne ré-invente pas la roue, mais c'est un classique ici. Un espèce de McDonald plus. Prix très abordable. La ligne peut être longue, Mais le service est relativement rapide."}
{"text":"First:   If you are not aware of the \"secret\" menu then get off yelp and consult your only steadfast friend since third grade...THE INTERWEBZ! Once this is done and the mysteries of the secret menu have been revealed then and only then can you truly appreciate what it is that these fine young men and women of in-n-out do for us daily. Now that the universe has expanded for you...try everything you thought you liked before and fall in love with it all over again."}
{"text":"Late night burger and fry cravings are satisfied thank you to In N Out! Staff is friendly as always and the food was amazing as expected. I ordered a 3x3 animal style with animal fries and a chocolate shake."}
{"text":"Cabbed it from our hotel so I could give it a shot before my flight back to Chicago and I'm quite happy I did. I went with the Double Double and while it certainly wasn't the healthiest thing I've ever eaten, it was pretty awesome and I'll probably hit it up next time I'm in town. I still need a shirt, anyway."}
{"text":"This has to one of my all time favorite fast food spots hands down. The food is so fresh. Double-double w/ grilled onions and Animal Fries.."}
{"text":"Like all Chicagoans, the minute I land at LAS, LAX, or anywhere else out west, I immediately look forward to grabbing myself a double double animal style with chopped chilies.  So really, if I could just give a blanket 5 stars to all In-N-Outs, I probably wouldn't hesitate, no matter how skewed my ratings graph gets.  I do want to point out this location though, for not being too far from the strip, yet having little to no line compared to the ones closer to Las Vegas boulevard.  If you've got a car rented, might as well swing by this location en route to the strip."}
{"text":"I was extemely happy with my whole experience up until I got home checked my burger since I have allergies making sure it was ketchup only I started to eat it and about half way through my mouth got swollen and I could barely breath thanks to there being onions on but they were just wiped off digesting any part of an onion gives me severe allergies now thanks to the person who was to lazy to make another burger I have to deal with the for the next 2-6 Hours but customer service was amazing."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get a burger on the planet... And also only 4 buxks for a burger, fries, and a drink - so you can blow more money on the table games or bottle service."}
{"text":"I love burgers and since we were staying at Harrah's and looking for something cheaper and fresh, we stopped here at their new strip location here in The Linq. It was time for me to finally determine if it was all hype or reality at In & Out.  After a modest wait (15 mins?) my double-double \"animal style\" was ready and was adequate in taste, but far from spectacular. Fries were a disappointment- very lukewarm temperature, and sort of bland tasting. Went back up to the counter and asked for some fresh and hotter ones, and was served the same poor tasting and equally lukewarmy crap.   In this price range, I'd probably recommend Shake Shack or Fuku Burger - both just a short walk away. And for a tiny bit more, Twin Peaks would be a better choice too."}
{"text":"What an enjoyable and affordable meal! The burgers were right on it as well as the fries! It will be one of my stops on my next visit."}
{"text":"Very yummy!!  I always make a special trip so I can ear this food. 4 stars because it isn't fast; average time (they make it fresh) is at least 15 min, at this location, from in the door to eating."}
{"text":"Love that In-N-Out. Fast food normally makes my skin crawl, so I extra super duper love this place since everything is yummy tasty and (although I'm reluctant to research too deeply), from what I know, nothing in their ingredients would make me wanna vom. Cool!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out burgers are awesome. Service is great. Growing up in this neighborhood it's defiantly a popular joint . Fresh ingredients! The place is very clean and always super busy."}
{"text":"Going through all the gourmet burgers that we rifle thru on a regular basis, once in a while it's nice to go to a fast food joint to get a regular, good ole' fashioned burger without having to feel like you've sold your soul to the evil incarnate...  Coming from the East Coast, In N' Out was this idolized burger business model which marketed fresh ingredients in a super paired down list and even a secret menu which gave those in the know, 'an insider elite status' (it was even brought up during class at The Hotel School...although I wouldn't call it a menu, rather a variation on existing items )  But, In N' Out has that evolutionized mystique, a cross between nostalgia, fast-food fare with that healthy, Californian fresh-food zeitgeist that dupes all of us into believing that we're eating healthy and saving the dolphins with each purchase...  With that said, the burgers, the architecture along with its core values has become a staple in the West Coast culinary landscape and it's always on the list of places we go to grab something quick and delicious, (it's really bad that there's one across the gym...)  It's a pretty simple menu, and going there is no brainer, but we like to get a couple of things different; for the burger, it's always a 2x4,  (a double double - two beef patties with extra cheese -four slices) and get it, 'Animal Style' where the patty is Mustard Grilled, with Grilled Onions, Thousand Island Dressing and Extra Pickles.  You can ask for the Burger to be, 'Medium Rare' for it be pink in the middle, (sometimes well done can be too tough for me) all in all, it's got great flavor and the Beef shines through above all the condiments....  For the Fries, it's got to be, 'well done' (cooked until they're extra crispy).  I don't know, but maybe because they cut the fries fresh, they can be chewy/soggy so when you order well done, they come out crunchier.  on top of that, we order them, 'Animal Style' as well; that's with Melted Cheese with Grilled Onions and Thousand Island Dressing on top.  You have to eat it with a fork and it's decadent!!! Wash it down with a Root Beer Float, (Root Beer with a scoop of Vanilla Ice Creams) and you're back in the 50's, beeboping to the jukebox after school with girls in hoop skirts and neckerchiefs swung to the side!!!!  In fact, I feel like having In N' Out right now.... gotta run!!!!  Ratings (Out of Five Stars)  Food:            4 Ambience:    3.5 Service:        3.5"}
{"text":"After driving in from Northern Nevada, this was our first stop.  You know, you have to have priorities, and In-N-Out consistently delivers.  We did get lost, as it was a bit tricky to find.  We depended on our GPS, and that may have been a big part of the problem.  Only little glitch, not quite as clean as I've come to expect at these places, but it won't stop me, I'll be back."}
{"text":"SD, Cali resident.  Love IN-N-OUT.  In Vegas for a conference and first night, of course I go walk to this place.  I am staying at the Delano.  About a 2.5 mile roundtrip.  WELL WORTH IT.  Taking away a star just because I ordered well done fries and they were still the normal soggy fries.  I love In-N-Out and really, 4 stars is a good rating.  Just wish I got crispy fries."}
{"text":"This is one of the best In N Out i have ever visited! Fast, friendly service and the place is very clean.   Ive noticed that on weekends this place becomes a high school hang out spot so I'd recommend another In N Out.   My only complaint that i had for the young man at the counter is they dont have a tip jar. Its sad that self-help froyo places have tip jars but not this amazing fast food joint. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Cheap, made-to-order burgers featuring fresh ingredients?  Yes please!  Very busy during the school year, so visit accordingly."}
{"text":"I love in-n-out burgers, but I love poutine even more. When somebody mentioned that Animal styles fries were like poutine, I had to try. Oh gross. the onions, the bad cheese, and the hard consistency. Never again. I'll keep the animal style on the double double only. Worst idea ever."}
{"text":"Eh.  I just don't get the hype.    Here's the positive... The place is immaculate and well run. It's insanely busy and even the restrooms were spotless.  It's also *very* friendly and I enjoy the California look and vibe.    The meh... The burgers are OK.  Largely flavorless but well cooked and with fresh veggies.  The fries really aren't good at all.  They taste a bit like the really crappy old Wendy's fries.  I realize that you can customize it all you want with their \"secret menu\" .. but frankly their main menu should show off their best product.    Shake Shack has a significantly better product and it's very close just outside of New York New York."}
{"text":"2017 Review 37/100  Guys...it's In-N-Out. When can you ever go wrong with In-N-Out? If you're an East Coaster like me, you know that In-N-Out is the holy grail of West Coast dining and thus you must make a pilgrimage to the nearest In-N-Out location whenever you find yourself within close proximity.  This most recent trip to In-N-Out was a more special occasion because my friend who was traveling with me had never been before. It was exciting to me a part of her first experience and, of course, she loved it. Especially the Animal Style fries.  You can't beat a good Protein Style burger, fries and a drink for a few bucks. In-N-Out, you never let me down."}
{"text":"In-N-Out never fails to deliver. Awesome burger (Animal Style obviously), delicious fries, and a killer shake, all for well under $10, and maybe even for two people. This location is very efficient with a really friendly and industrious staff. As good or better than the California locations I've been to. Wish we had them in New York, but we'd find a way to screw it up somehow.  Way better than Shake Shack and anyone who tells you different is a liar and a scoundrel."}
{"text":"Fast service here, even when it gets busy! When the line started to get long last week when I was here, another cashier jumped on and began taking orders, which speeded up the line. I feel like the food comes out here faster than other locations and it is still hot and fresh. Can't go wrong with a double-double combo with grilled onions or animal style."}
{"text":"This is my favorite location of In-N-Out in the Valley. Not too packed and quick service. I can take or leave the chain in general. I used to be a fanatic but have since found better burgers. The fries are kinda lame and not crispy. The burgers are tasty but a little too salty for me. If you're down for the whole thing, this is the best location to do it. The shakes are good!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. People are always friendly!!  We love Luke!!  And Sam!!  Always gets our order right.  We have eaten here weekly in the 2 months we were visiting Vegas"}
{"text":"In-N-Out Burger is so delicious! I live close to this location and have eaten there many times in the two years since I moved to Vegas. The workers here are ALWAYS HAPPY and in a good mood. They are efficient, extremely competent, and have NEVER gotten my order wrong. As for the food, it is always delicious, and a great value!  The fries are best if you eat them immediately, before they cool off at all. In-N-Out Burger definitely lives up to all the hype I heard about it before I moved to the West Coast!"}
{"text":"I feel like all In n outs are the same and this location is no different. They're always busy and during peak lunch dinner times it's too long of a wait for me. The parking lot at this locations is a nightmare when it's busy. These burgers are good as far as fast food goes but not worth waiting 30 minutes or more for. Look behind you at Flaming Fajitas and imagine how good a margarita sounds."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this location there's 15+ cars and NEVER an employee outside taking orders to help speed up the wait. When's it's 100+ degrees... NOBODY wants to sit in their car, and watch employees chatting and hanging out inside your establishment!"}
{"text":"Burgers here never disappoint and it is such a reasonable price! Customer service here never skips a beat. They are always upbeat and very helpful. My burger is made fresh to order. Food can be packed to go, or packaged ready to eat. Hands down this has to be my favorite chain burger joint. Only gripe I have, is the location. It's always so crowded and parking can be a mess. Furthermore, I love this place!"}
{"text":"Love me some in and out. Living on the east coast these are non existent. Always speedy service and delicious burgers. You can never go wrong with a double double animal style. Everything is always fresh and tasty. Prices are very inexpensive. Hospitality is always great. Would love to see these on the east coast sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Total slop.  Do not go through drive through at night they will give you old crusty burger and fries.  I complained to Night Manager Dominic and he did not even look at the dried burger and fries he just immediately threw it away and gave me free meal card. Digusting food.  Should have gone to Burger King across the street.  In N Out so over rated."}
{"text":"I grew up eating here and man I wish this place was half as good as it used to be 15 years ago!! used to be my favorite,  I would say taste has gone down hill and custom orders arent as fun as it used to be, still cheap and quality double cheesburger under 5$? not really a thing these days so they win there, plus fun place and Secret menu is cool, you cant call to complain thou, however they will route you to there caliornia office and there customer servise and mission statement as a company is excellent, they gave me a card for any burger fries and a shake and a personall letter, to bad there crap employees make sure to let you know that is only for things \"On the Menu\" funny the Burger they keep messing up is a triple Animal Style, oh well... this place used to literally be the best burger stand ....... if u still wanna go make sure to miss this Garbage location theyve screwed me over 5 times, 5 times i got free food card too:)"}
{"text":"Ok, as a New Yorker with burger joints galore in this city, have heard about \"In-N-Out Burgers\" on the West Coast for years now, how it was this irresistible ultimate burger joint place. So, on 1st visit to Vegas, made it a priority to visit an In-N-Out to see for myself what all the hype was about. And to be honest, the burger really kinda fell flat. Or let's just say, it was OK, but definitely no WOW, not much taste to it or anything to write home about nor warrant another visit anytime soon. Though, I will say, for the price and for being fast-food, it's one of the better burgers on the market. But would say, it ranks right in line with Shake Shack burgers, but cheaper. The restaurant is clean, service is friendly and there was no big line at this location and the menu is simple, burgers, fries of a few variations and shakes/soda. So go if you must to check it off your bucket list and judge for yourself but for me, it's one of those \"been there, done that\" experiences."}
{"text":"I've been to several in-n-out joints in California and I've always been a huge fan. This location in Vegas gets a 5 star review for service! It was super busy when we went (not surprising) but the employees were all really friendly and nice. I was expecting it to take long because it's pretty typical that it's a long wait. Since I made two different orders, I got them at different times. When I told them which order I was waiting for they reassured me that it is on its way. They kept checking in on me and letting me know where they were at with my second order. I really appreciated how nice they were, it made waiting less annoying haha.   As for the food... one of my favorite burgers ever. I got the double double with onions. I'm not a big fan of the fries but I got well done fries. Finished it all and I was happy! Definitely coming back every time I visit Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with our visit to in n out.  I usually order animal style and all I got was double tomato?! The fries are also stale  it's so sad because I love in n out... next time will skip this location and go to The Habit down the street."}
{"text":"Black shoe leather. Worst burger ever. Don't use the drive up as they will dump their rejects on you."}
{"text":"The cheeseburger and fries are always good here... and good for the price. We do come here early or later and not during rush hours because it could take times to get your food when they're busy."}
{"text":"Busiest In n Out I've ever seen!  Beside, all of them are busy. It's crazy!!  Wish they'll come to Florida!!!!  My favorite Burger!  Everything about it is so amazing!  The way they work and the way it taste!  Love the burgers love the fries.  Just cant go wrong w in n out!  LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"This in and out gets a LOT of traffic and they handle it amazing. We walked in at 11:30am on a Sunday and they had two lines going to the door. We got through the line and ordered and got out food in 20min. These employees know how to hussle."}
{"text":"Looking for a fast and cheap meal in Vegas? This is your place! I do not usually eat fast food at all so I wasn't super excited to come here.  Turns out the burgers were pretty good! I was told to try animal style and I think that is what makes it! The only thing I didn't really care for are the fries. If I would have just had them plain I'm sure they would be good but the melted slice of cheese that just harden after cooling was not great!  All around good experience!"}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out. One of the best hamburger joints. As for this location, they are fast, efficient and accurate every time. And the restaurant is always clean. I like ordering the #1 combo and a coke."}
{"text":"Nothing like a little piece of home, having just moved from Orange County, Ca. I was craving something familiar and In-N-Out hit the spot!! I got my usual Double Double animal style and a fry animal style (what can I say I was hungry) and it didn't disappoint, my girlfriend got her usual Double Double ketchup and mustard only and a French fry.  Everything was amazing and what I come to expect from In-N-Out,grilled onions were perfect, fries were hot just out the fryer, cheese was melted perfectly. It's not that far from my house, I will most definitely be back and soon!!!"}
{"text":"The food; really good, especially for the price. I noticed a few \"yelpers\" prefer McDonald's over this place. My only comment to them is that these same folks would probably eat dog crap if you put syrup on it and call it tasty.  Those people obviously have never had a good hamburger. McDonald's is the bottom of the barrel guys, IN-N-OUT is the creme de la creme. Anyway, I always order mine special, (no sauce, add mustard and extra mustard on the side). It's always correct. The only drawback is the parking lot and not enough tables inside the restaurant to comfortably seat everyone at the busy lunch time. (Saw some folks waiting to find a table and they ended up eating outside due to nowhere to sit inside). IN-N-OUT might want to make the restroom area smaller and increase the inside dining area. Other than that, the food was great and the price was more than reasonable. I also appreciated the good customer service. Very rare these days."}
{"text":"Best Fast food burger place in the country!!"}
{"text":"Food was great as always and the service was even better. My man bryce had a great attitude he was smiling the whole time and gave off great energy. It's 11:30 and for him to still have that kind of enthusiasm is special and I hope he knows how much customers appreciate that kind of politeness! Clint was also very polite and friendly! Thanks in n out team great job as always!"}
{"text":"Always great burgers, service and shakes. Quick drive thru even if it's packed. Always accurate with the orders and everyone there is always nice."}
{"text":"First time having in and out and I already knew it wasn't going to be better than shake shack but it was still good. The double double was really good but the animal style fries are by far the worst things I've ever had. They were cold, old and just flat. It was honestly disgusting and I couldn't believe they would actually serve that. Please don't come here for the fries. Only the burger. The place was pretty packed even around midnight/1am"}
{"text":"Ive been hearing the argument about In & Out versus Five Guys for years and since I was in Arizona I thought I had to give it a try.  The service was excellent The people who work here were clean , polite , helpful and courteous.    The restaurant itself was extremely well taken care of and clean. I don't really like the seats being fixed to the tables but that's a minor thing.  I had a Double Double , fries and a strawberry milk shake. The burger was very tasty but I should have gotten a 3 x 3 or a 4 x 4 as I felt the meat was a little overwhelmed by the toppings and the sauce. But even with that said this was a really good burger.  The shake was awesome. I haven't had a shake this good since I was a kid at Bob's Big Boy.  The fires on the other had were a disappointment. They were a little soggy and not very crisp. But that could have been  just a bad batch.  Now to whether its better then Five Guys.   No its not better then Five Guys. Its not worse either. What it is , is different then Five Guys. Just like a White Castle is different then In & Out and Five Guys. I like all three places and don't think one is better or worse then the other."}
{"text":"Epic is the only word to use when describing this place. If I had one closer to me it would be devistation because I would be there all the time!"}
{"text":"Best burger place ever! My Fiancee and I love In-N-Out-Burger! At first glance, it seems like an average burger place with just a few menu items, however, once you know about the \"secret menu\" everything changes. You can get anything from grilled onions with special sauce to lettuce wrapped burgers, all absolutely delicious. Their fries are also amazing, especially animal style. I love that they use fresh ingredients and make their fries right on the spot.   When I want a burger,  In-N-Out-Burger is definitely the only place I go!   Last but not least, try a neapolitan shake, it will be the best shake you have ever had!"}
{"text":"A great late night easy dinner. In-N-Out's quality is consistent, with good fries and a quasi-secret menu. My favorite order is a cheeseburger, animal style, with extra chiles. Animal style just means grilled onions and thousand island dressing, but it definitely dresses up their plain burger. The various locations throughout the valley can get really crowded depending on what time you go, so that's worth considering.   The menu is small, but that keeps the prices low! It's cheaper to get a meal for my boyfriend and I here than at any of the other fast food places. The employees are also quite friendly.  There are small bible references on some of the packaging, like the cups and fry packages. I'm not sure what they reference, so if anyone knows that could be interesting to find out!"}
{"text":"No flavors in their burgers & fries, I don't know how anyone that loves burgers eat here, I may try another location but after this I'm not too sure....went with my family and tried a piece of what they ordered too and it was the same, no flavor. better off making my own at home."}
{"text":"Ok, it's not the wonderful burger that my Californian friends were raving about. I'll even second those here who suggest preferring Five Guys' burgers when it comes to chains. Still, it was very good and I'd definitely come back if I were in the area.   It's cheap, and the various not-so-secret-off-menu options provide endless calorie opportunities. I notched a star off because their fries are just plain terrible.  Warning: if you have agoraphobia, do not go there. It's CROWDED."}
{"text":"It's memorial day weekend.  It' saturday night. Lotsa of people are out, and about. Of course they get hungry. Including us, and I was madly craving their world famous French Fries. I like it \"well done\" for some extra crunch! Depending on my mood, sometimes I like to get my onions grilled which then you would order it as \"Animal Style\" or sometimes I like my onions raw. There were people everywhere! Parking lot was full. Drive thru was insanely busy and traffic. Inside, the line was stupidly long, but tolerable. The staff was quick, and attentive. And the place was clean, there was a staff member going around cleaning the empty tables, and making sure the free tables are clean and ready to use. Five minutes off the strip for some great quality burgers you just can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Despite the near-inaccessibility of this In-N-Out location, you'll still find it packed to the gills with tourists looking to find out what's so special about this burger joint.   I don't have to tell you it's worth it.  Because of this location's proximity to the Strip you'll be hard pressed to avoid a longish wait time and find a place to sit. Wait it out and you'll be rewarded with a tasty burger (and fries and a milkshake... you ordered all of those, right?). It might be one of the better hangover cures you'll experience in Vegas."}
{"text":"Good experience first time here very very crowded.   If you come with friends have someone get the table while others order the food."}
{"text":"Considering how busy they always are and long lines... they move along very quickly everytime.... it'd probably take longer to get your food through McDonald's drive thru. Plus the food is freshly cooked... not like other burger joints."}
{"text":"The people were friendly. The food was average. Idk what all the hype was about. They were pretty busy so they couldn't clean the tables in time for other customers."}
{"text":"Typical In and Out Burger.  They make only make burgers and fries.  And they do a very good job of it.  The place was very busy but still clean.  I had the #2 with grilled onions.  Was just as I expected a good burger and very fresh fries."}
{"text":"Driving back to LA and need that In & Out fix?  Forget about the one off of Flamingo that everyone's hip to head about 4 miles south on the 15 and get off on Blue Diamond Road.  Head west one block off the highway and you're there.   Compared to the other location by the strip, this location is considered desolate of people.  Head here to avoid the madness at the other location."}
{"text":"They just NEED to come to the East Coast already!!!  Today I had the Double Double and the Animal Style Fries. DELICIOUS!!!!  Totally worth the wait as they make everything fresh. I must anytime you're west of the Mississippi!!"}
{"text":"Let's do it Animal Style, oh yeaah! Haha and thanks to learning about the not-so-secret menu, I was able to get my burger \"Protein Style\" too, so no buns here, just wrapped in lettuce! Messier, yes,  but healthier as far as fast food goes, and usually it doesnt.  I NEVER get fast food, I don't mean rarely, or hardly ever... I mean... nevaarr because as Jillian Michaels so elegantly puts it, \"that sh*t isn't food!\". But I'm in the South temporarily and I had to try it once before heading back up to the frigid midwest. The service was of descent speed, the cashier girl who took our order was exceptionally bubbly, and the food was ok.  I am used to eating majority clean foods, so it made my tum tum hurt a bit, but it was tasty!  I accompanied my burger with a chocolate milkshake, but no fries, still trying to keep it relatively healthy... but my cousin ordered some fries and they didn't look horrible.  I think they literally grab a potato, slice it into fry shape, and fry it up fresh on the spot just for your order... maybe, I think that's similar to how their process works. I didn't get any soda or beverage but the pink lemonade actually did look appealing,  perhaps if I go back again I shall give it a try.  They have ample seating indoors and an outdoor patio with some sunny spots and some shady spots.  The indoor area has booths and tables, which are handicap accessible.  Also, they have a drive-thru, of course as 99% of all fast-food places do these days.  It was fine for a once in awhile \"treat\" or splurge, but I wouldn't make a habit of it. As I write this, and my food has settled, the burps and after taste are quite uncomfortable :-/  I know there is basically a cult following for this place, but I just don't get it."}

{"text":"Simple, cheap, yummy. Great, friendly staff. Insanely affordable food and fresh ingredients...def not your typical fast food burger. The vanilla shakes are great. Wish they had these on the east coast!"}
{"text":"In-n-out is my favorite fast food place... and this specific location is my favorite in-n-out. It's on the way home for me - which is a good and bad thing. Good because it's so convenient; bad because it's so convenient! My week isn't complete without an in-n-out burger. Eeek!   I always go thru the drive-thru. One, because I am lazy. Two, because I can't stand the smell of onions! The entire restaurant reeks of onions as soon as you walk in and the smell stays on ya. No thanks. It's just so much easier to be lazy. Another reason I love the drive thru is because they're so friendly and fast. They ALWAYS greet with something along the lines of \"welcome to in-n-out, how are you doing today?\" Yeah lots of people ask that question but they actually care enough to follow through and give you a real answer and thank you if you ask how they are as well. It's great!"}
{"text":"In a pinch, this is ok I guess.  I don't know what all the fuss is about.  I don't really eat burgers at fast food places so maybe that is why I don't think this are anything special.  I had my little girl with me and we were at Desert Ridge and it was dinner time.  This place is so busy.  We got a burger each and a small strawberry shake.  I didn't like the shake at all.  I prefer the one from the chicken place.  I saw that they can wrap your burger in lettuce, so that is a plus if you don't want the carbs."}
{"text":"Sorry but this is the last straw.... I ordered three double-doubles and two animal style fries and was told there would be a wait for the fries after waiting in line for nearly 20 mins. After I got home to my surprise.. NO burgers in my bag.. AFTER PAYING AND WAITING FOR THEM... completely unprofessional, rip-off, robbery. Never visiting this pathetic location again, no in fact, I will never be dining at an in-n-out again that is a promise. What type of franchise would do that to loyal customers? Disgusting. Despicable. Disgraceful. Thanks for ruining my entire evening."}
{"text":"I visited this place during my trip to Las Vegas and it changed my life. The burgers were delicious!  I ordered two double double burgers with fries. The burgers were well cooked and well seasoned. They were juicy and had some of their special sauce. The fries were crunchy and fresh.  The employees were all very nice and polite. The place is really clean and it looked vintage. I was impressed overall.  I would certainly recommend this place and I will be returning on my next trip to Las Vegas.   I wish they had these in NYC."}
{"text":"What more can I say than this is one of my guilty pleasures of the West.  Double Double animal style with animal fries and an icy Coke.  Hard to go wrong with that in my book."}
{"text":"Love in n out burger! There burgers are delicious! The fries are okay, they are to small and a little dry.   The menu is short and simple the have 3 meals a double double (which is a 2 patties), cheeseburger, or a hamburger. They will ask you if you want onions on it, it's raw onions not cooked, it's to powerful for me. I love their secret menu toppings it's called Animal Style, which they can add on your sandwich or fries. On your sandwich they will add grilled onions, pickles, and extra spread sauce. The sandwich already comes with tomatoes & lettuce on it. I love the spread sauce it makes it taste better. It's like a thousand island dressing. There's only one size for the fries.  I love how they have verses hidden on the bottom of the cups and the back of the fries container.   They do have seating outside as well. They are usually open till 1am during the week & until 2 am during the weekend."}
{"text":"Very crowded, but as usual, the food is consistent and good if you like In and Out burgers.   Limited menu of burgers, fries, soda, and shakes.  Love that you can order your burger \"protein\" which is lettuce wrapped.   Not my favorite fast food French fries, but the burgers are good."}
{"text":"This place is always, always packed.  I will not ever take the drive-through because it is forever. When the customer line is long they will/do put additional persons at the registers. The burgers are served freshly-made and the flourishes are very fresh. There is a member of my party who refers to this place as his 'church' (silly boy). It has always appeared clean to me, even the water closets."}
{"text":"Despite the long line, we had exceptionally fast service, the staff was super friendly, and the food was great!! Two thumbs up and we'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Was in Vegas, and had the pleasure of visiting In and Out Burger on our trip. This place is amazing. For a place with a very simple menu I was impressed. I got 2 double burgers and fries and it was still under $10! The burgers here are addicting. I just regret not ordering more. If any In and Out Burger executives are reading this PLEASE COME TO CANADA And OPEN UP SHOP!! Especially Toronto."}
{"text":"I'm not a large burger fan but when I feel like a burger, in and out is the spot. So fresh tasting, not oily or full grease. The fries are even better, they aren't salty or soaked in oil.  This place is always busy, drive thru line had to be at least 10-12 cars deep.   They have tons of workers which is why I feel thier wait really isn't that long. They are all friendly too, so thats a plus especially for a fast food joint. Good service is rare."}
{"text":"Visited In-N-Out for the first time in months but got the shock of my life.  Noticed that the price have increased by at least 35% on all items so I asked the young man if they got a pay raise..YES he said!  No wonder the prices have jumped so high now.  Ordered my no. 2 and the wife had her no. 1 animal style and I about fell over when the entire bill came close to $12 for both of us.  Never again I told my wife, this is the last time I'm ever gonna eat here or any In-N-Out place again.  I'm not against workers getting raises but to over charge the customers for a product that hasn't changed in years is just plain outrageous.  I hope every body who reads this agrees and stops going to this place to eat.  Better off going to Burger King or McDonalds for their burgers (2-$5.00)"}
{"text":"What else can you say about in n out? It's classic, always delicious, fresh and service was quick! It always hits the spot. We ordered two animals style cheeseburgers and animal style fries plus a plain cheeseburger with no dressing for the little one. I was surprised how fast they were considering they're right off the freeway. Plus they gave an in n out shop next door for all your memorabilia needs. Loved it"}
{"text":"Great place to eat, but the management need to pay more attention to the nasty smelling homeless that walks in to steal the fountain drinks. I see this almost every time I come here. They dig through the trash and retrieve a In&Out Cups walks in and fill it with drinks then walk out. NASTY and Smelling like a Piss."}
{"text":"Finding an in-n-out right off the freeway in Arizona was a pleasant surprise. Even more so, even amongst the hustle and bustle, having an associate ask about how your meal was multiple times and promptly cleaning up your table earns this location five well deserved stars!"}
{"text":"So were driving back to our hotel about 1230am and low and behold theres Inn-n-out burger. Yes we had to stop and get out Fix. We went inside and it was still packed to the hilt. Got lucky and scored a table. I order while kids and oana save table.   We get two combo meals,one with a soda and one with a shake and two seperate burgers. We eat for under $16.00. Thats a family of four. We cant eat that cheap anywhere,not even in denver.    Our food was cooked to perfection and was piping hot. Jason the manager was the bomb,totally took care of us.   I cant wait till they come to denver colorado,better yet they need to come to WESTMINSTER, colorado. I would be in heaven.   This Inn-n-out on tropicana and I--15 is awesome. They also have there own store for souveniers."}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out Burger! It's so fresh, simple, and service is always great! I always order the double double with fries and a drink. I get both grilled onions and fresh onions on my burger and they are always happy to make the customer happy with their order.  The cashiers are quick and efficient and always smile. The cleaners and order callers are also happy and smiling. The kitchen is clean and makes me wish my kitchen was that clean. The drinks are all self service with free refills. The ketchup and condiments are self service and the area around there are clean. It's sometimes hard to find a place to eat your meal but they have inside and outside dining area. This is the first place I like to eat at every time I come to Vegas. It's starts my vacation off right!"}
{"text":"Always go to this Inn N Out burger everytime I go to Vegas.  I got drive thru this time because I had to check into my hotel soon.  But me and my friend was starving and this place hit the spot.  Two Double double meals with coke.  Burger was delicious, drive thru staff was friendly, and service was pretty quick.  They even apologized for the wait. (approx. 2 minutes)  Come on thats fast for freshly make burgers.  Overall excellent experience as usual."}
{"text":"It's famous in every city that has one for a reason. The two things that really stood out to me and my lunchtime cohort were the fries and the simplicity of the menu. While other fast food joints are expanding their menu into areas they shouldn't be, In N Out has really focused in on one thing, and one thing only: burgers. Few places can boast that they are able to survive and truly thrive on one core item, but In N Out has really done it. Delicious burgers, amazing fresh-cut fries, and quite honestly the friendliest fast-food staff you'll ever encounter. Highly recommend for a diner on the go."}
{"text":"It's in n out! I mean, always consistently delicious and won't break the bank. We pulled in at peak dinner hour but the drive thru was quick!! Burgers were delicious and fries were perfectly cooked!"}
{"text":"I dont think I've ever been to a bad In n Out. Some are better than others, however.   The cheese burger i ordered was absolutely delicious tonight. The patty could be bigger. But, for me who no longer needs all that red meat, a small patty is fine. Its the combination  of proportionate ingredients together that make it the cheese burger that it is.  Toasted bun, grilled whole slice of onion, served with Coca Cola. Tonight this place grilled up some perfection in the cheese burger i ordered. Service here I'll rate at 5 stars also. Healthy looking, courteous, friendly, clean cut kids, working their butts off.  This is one of those VERY GOOD In n Out places. Five Stars !!!"}
{"text":"I was excited that an in n out opened closer to my home. But I was super disappointed not only did they completely mess up the order the burgers sucked with ungrilled buns barely any grilled onions and wayy too many pickles and barely any cheese. I felt like I was eating a different burger compared to my regular location. GO TO YOUR REGULAR IN N OUT THIS PLACE IS INEXPERIENCED AND SUCKS."}
{"text":"This was my first time EVER going to In-N-Out as an East Coaster and I found the food OK. I will say the service at this incredibly busy Las Vegas Strip location is phenomenal. The line is non-stop & never ending, but those cashiers and cooks keep things moving!   I ordered the Animal Style Fries. The fries were not the crispy, but maybe this is an In-N-Out signature. I did devour the entire tray because the sauce & caramelized onions will not stop calling your name.   I am a non-meat eater so there are basically zero options if you are looking for a veggie burger here - just FYI."}
{"text":"I live in SoCal so of course I'm accustomed to In-N-Out Burger and I'm super happy that they've opened up a few in Las Vegas. It was a pleasure to see the location and to finally have a meal that didnt cost me and my wife $30+ dollars; lol  I had the Double-Double Protien style with whole grilled onions and some animal fries.  I've occasionally met a few people who don't think that this is the best burger out there but those people have no joy in their hearts."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing! The food tastes fabulous! The tables were a little dirty though which is understandable, we got our food really fast and the employees there were really nice."}
{"text":"Probably the most affordable burger, In-N-Out is pretty good if you don't want Mcdonalds or Burger King. Their menu is simple with a secret menu (animal style please!). Their burger is pretty good with lettuce and tomato. Its a very simple burger that can be easily done at home but for $1.95 its a steal. Their fries are quite small and you can grab a bunch of them and dunk them in ketchup. I wouldn't say I'd eat here often but if Im in the mood for a simple burger and fries with not much in my wallet, then In-N-Out I will go."}
{"text":"When will in n out ever stop taking my payments with their hands soaking wet? Maybe I'm the only one to think this is disgusting.. I'm not too into the whole getting a soiled receipt and wet credit card back."}
{"text":"This in n out taste just like the rest.. a couple things bother me at this location though.  1) they are very slow at night 2) the person doing the cash register in drive-thru always has soaking hands getting my card and receipts all wet. I'm hoping these are clean hands and not nasty ass dishwashing hands.  Would enjoy seeing these areas improved! In n out is still the goat though"}
{"text":"Delicious as always. The freshest ingredients at this location! Look at how green that lettuce is and how plump the tomatoes are. Sometimes they are going a little too fast because I ordered to go and they gave me my food as if I were eating there, so minus one star for that."}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii, it seems like everyone who have been to the mainland talk about the In N Out Burger, especially my sister. She said this place is a must try and when it comes to food,  her must trys are a MUST. Driving around LA and to Vegas I would see In N Out Burger here and there, and each time I would point it out to my husband but unfortunately we were not able to stop by.. so by the time we finally made it to the In N Out burger at the end of the our trip, you can guess that my expectation of this burger was out of this world! I thought their burger was really good and I must stay that I enjoyed each an every bite of it!"}
{"text":"Love how they keep somebody in the drive thru just to speed things up. One of the better burgers for the price. Can't go wrong with it. You have to get the peppers to."}
{"text":"best fast food style burger for price and quality. fries are only good if you eat them fresh. like as they are falling out of the basket while the fries master is cooking them."}
{"text":"This In-N-Out is almost always packed, which makes me a bit nervous. But hey, since that's a personal preference, I won't knock off a star.  As usual, this restaurant offers flawless casual fare, just like the other locations. Dear God. Their chocolate milkshakes have a perfect thick texture, and their food can always be customized. Whether you want three patties on one burger, lettuce as a bun or a milkshake with all three flavors, you can get it here.  My tried and tested favorite is the double-double Animal Style with no tomatoes. It has not steered me wrong yet."}
{"text":"O In-N-Out, In-N-Out!  wherefore art thou In-N-Out  deny thy customers and refuse thy business  if thou wilt not, be but sworn my personal chef  & i'll no longer be hungry.  No but seriously, best burgers in the universe. I want them all. Om nom nom nom. Make sure to try the Animal Style burger at least once in your lifetime. I usually stick with the double-double plain, but sometimes I order animal style when I'm feeling extra ravenous and shameful. I can even order triple or quadruple burgers if I so desire. Thanks In-N-Out, for letting me stuff my face the American way."}
{"text":"This is a great burger joint! Nope not a McDonald's or BK because they do only burgers! Juicy, fresh fries a drink 5.55 no xtra frills. I love it and omg the shakes are milky creamy goodness! Employees are perky and nice. The dine was a lil dirty but, hey I went during rush hr! A really good place"}
{"text":"Really enjoy the protein style double double   My son can eat a 4/4 cheeseburger, he loves every bit.   I recommend in and out anytime before Burger King or McDonalds"}
{"text":"In N Out is my go-to for fast food.  Usually, the line is long, but it goes by fast, and it's well worth the wait.  For the quality of the food, it's pretty cheap too. Whenever I have friends visiting from the East Coast, I'm sure to take them to here because they're not as lucky to have one anywhere close to them. Always pleased with this place!"}
{"text":"Great crew at this location.  We live right down the street and eat here often. Everything is fresh and the place is super clean for being so busy. Once in a blue moon the crew is off their game and a bun gets a little over done or or your fries are ice cold.  Just the crew and it's fixed without a worry. My favorite is the inspiring word with every meal. :-)"}
{"text":"Seeing their name makes me want to go get a cheeseburger. And well done french fries animal style. So good!"}
{"text":"Yummy fast food and fresh burgers and fries. I went in during lunch time, which wasn't too busy compared to dinner time. The service was a little slower than usual, which was a little surprising. The burger and fries were good and I always go for the pink lemonade. Only concern is that the take out bags end up being really drenched/stained with oil and grease; not sure if that's because it's packed right by the burger making-grilling area and/or the burger being slightly exposed and not wrapped completely. Overall, still can never go wrong with In n Out."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to grab a quick meal, clean place and hot fries, what else could I ask for?  It stays busy, but you don't wait for too long, it's worth it."}
{"text":"I Love In & Out... I Just Don't Like How Busy It Gets... Other Than That, It's The Best Burger Place"}
{"text":"What can you say? It's In-N-Out Burger.  During this trip, I wasn't able to dine in so I went through the drive thru. Not only did the gentleman at the window hand me extra napkins with my order (a delicous double double and fries animal style,) but he also handed me a nice little paper place mat so just in case the driver hit a bump and I dropped something, it wouldn't end up in my lap.  What a nice guy!"}
{"text":"What can I say? It's In-N-Out Burger.  This is one of the busier locations I've been to, but they don't seem to miss a beat.  It's right off of The Strip, so it's easy to get to whether you're driving or catching a taxi or an Uber. Even though it's busy, the room seems to turn over quickly and the staff does a good job of getting you lined up and through the line. I've never had any issues finding a seat, even at peak times.  And those burgers... I'm not sure if it's because it's a west coast delicacy, the freshness of the ingredients or going animal style, but they really hit the spot.  I highly recommend stopping by, especially if you're visiting and you're not sure when you'll make it out west again."}
{"text":"SECRET MENU ITEM: VEGGIE BURGER! awesome alternative to the standard burger. I always come back to this location because they do such a great job of accuracy with dietary restrictions.   Veggie burger can be made with no cheese, no spread for full vegan selection. Onion grilled or raw can be added along with pepperchini! If you ask nicely ;)  Kuddos to the manager of this location! Your staff is always pleasant and happy to help their customers. The cleanliness of this location is phenomenal and reflects great management."}
{"text":"Tonight I had the best drive thru experience I've ever had. Nancy and Clara at the windows we so nice and seemed genuinely happy to be there. Being able to watch the team (girl power!) was so cool, everyone was working so hard but were so organized. And my food was so good  that was the best protein style burger, everything was just perfect, thank you guys so much! Keep up the great work, I can't wait to be back!  Check#4657"}
{"text":"In-N-Out is reliable - good food, freshly prepared - eat the fries while they're fresh!  Simple menu - just as it should be."}
{"text":"I cannot, for the life of me, understand why people like this place. We have eaten here once before and didn't like it (this was about 6 years ago) so I decided to try it again.....everyone else loves it, right?!?!   These burgers are dry and tasteless. I don't like the fries, my kids didn't like the hamburgers or the grilled cheese (which comes on a hamburger bun?!).  The experience at this particular location was average. My wait was too long - considering there are like 2 things on the menu.   Oh well, I guess I cannot count myself among the masses that love this place."}
{"text":"Wish I wasn't already so full. I went here via recommendation from Joe Rogan and its was absolutely amazing. If you have never had it you should try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Consistent and genuinely nice people that work here! Everyone is super helpful. Drive through is way quick. Property is very clean. I don't have one negative thing to say about this place. Everything is ran and managed perfectly. Thank you for the awesome food!"}
{"text":"They pay their workers well and make the best fast food burger in town!  Great place!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience at In and Out. I love that you can order your burger protein style (in lettuce rather than a bun). I thought it was very tasty."}
{"text":"A great place to get a burger they are fresh and tasty.  The burgers are hot and juicy also, the fries aw fresh cut and fried to order. It is a must stop for me when going to Vegas. Checkout their website for the secret menu options!"}
{"text":"No trip of mine to Phoenix is complete without at least one stop to an In-N-Out!  This location is in the Desert Ridge shopping complex and it's close to the JW Marriott Desert Ridge.  Easy to find parking and it's not as busy as the other In-N-Out location that I went to near the airport.  There's not much else to say that hasn't been said... honestly, it's my favorite fast food burger and a place that I seek out when I come to one of the 4 states with an In-N-Out.  Love the quality ingredients, the crisp lettuce and the toasted bun.  Best cheeseburger and fries meal for only $5 :)"}
{"text":"Yeah yeah, I'm that one who doesn't think much of the food at In-N-Out Burger. So?!  As Joyce W. knows, I've been living under a rock for some time now apparently, because I have never been to an In-N-Out Burger before. So while in Vegas traveling with a bunch of crazy cousins, we came here for lunch on the second to the last day of my vacation.  I got a Double Double which is basically a double cheeseburger with lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and ketchup. I also got the Animal Style Fries that people have told me is a \"must try\". It had melted cheese, carmelized onions, and what I think is, Thousand Island dressing on it. Nothing worth ordering a second time.  The fries, by the way, suck. With or without all the stuff on it, they weren't crispy and it was boring and lame. My cousin said that I should have asked for it \"well done\". Why? To me, just make it one way. With a nice amount of crispiness on the outside.   Lastly, the burger was a little too salty for my liking, but I guess for about four bucks, I really can't complain. This location is right next to UNLV, so if you're a student on a budget, this place is for you.  If you're a fan of In-N-Out Burger, great! It's inexpensive eats. But as for me? I'm glad I tried it, but I'm in no hurry to go back."}
{"text":"Was on vacation to Las Vegas and hadn't had In-N-Out Burger in a couple years. Still great tasting and well worth the price. Can't wait until the next time I'm traveling through an area that has an In-N-Out Burger!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out is such a common visit, and there are so many locations, so I'll focus on this single visit alone. The drive-thru was jamb packed as usual, so as usual I walk inside. And as usual, there is no wait inside. I walk right up to the cashier and place my order. She was polite from the beginning and didn't struggle at taking my order. Also as usual, I say a \"double double with everything\" but they still ask me \"do you want onions?\" It's ok though, better safe than sorry though right? I know if you hate onions, they will end your life if you accidentally bite into one. I'll still say \"with everything\" and will still probably be asked \"do you want onions?\" No big deal though!   It was an ordinary visit to In-N-Out. Great food, great location! Packed as always!"}
{"text":"Let me just start with the food is worth the wait. Don't ever doubt it,  Fresh hamburgers, fresh cut real potatoes, and real shakes, you can taste the difference, the prices are very reasonable.  It's become a tradition to come every time I pick my sad up from the airport, twice a year. Love the eat in your car matts, hell yes! Who has time to wait to get home and have cold food?!  Secret menu items. Grilled cheese. Veggies burger. Lettuce wrapped burgers. Animal style fries and burgers. Neapolitan shakes. I could go on but those are the ones I've personally tried.  The customer service here rocks. The guys who do drive through bust me up. I always ask for grilled onions on the side or extra sauce on the side. Good sense of humor and young guys, equal funny remarks. They have asked for our number and said we looked pretty.. Oh yeah me feel good, especially when I know I'm getting older and usually look like crap. They work hard for those tips haha."}
{"text":"This review is going to be short and sweet. The lines will be long, but it's worth it. Everyone knows this is a must during any west coast visit. I got the double double. It's delicious, juicy and a step above a regular fast food burger. If you haven't been, try it out at least once. Order off of the secret menu and get an \"Animal Style\" burger. Grilled onions, pickles, a special sauce and a mustard patty. Yum..."}
{"text":"The first place my wife and I stop when we get PHX. Excellent as always with great employees!!"}
{"text":"I can never turn down In N Out and their amazing spread! The food is always good and cooked to perfection. This particular location however was a complete mess. I'm hoping it's not their usual and they just happened to be understaffed that particular night. But there were about 30 people in line that went out the door and wrapped around the corner waiting to order food; yet there was only one person working the register. The floors were messy with trash and no one was walking around to clean things up.  I was with a friend who previously was a manager at In N Out in Arizona and she was critiquing the way things were being ran and mention multiple times how they would fail a QFC (Quality, Friendliness, Cleanliness) check up.  Trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, it was a Friday night and located right next to the Las Vegas strip. But then again those reasons should have been taken into consideration with store planning."}
{"text":"Back when this In-N-Out location opened, Desert Ridge was my old stomping grounds as I worked at the Albertson's across the parking lot. The other day, I stopped back in while on my way back to work after an appointment in the area.   Not too much has changed at this location since the last time I was there. The line at the drive thru is still long, the service is still good, and the food is still great. I ordered my usual, but with cheese fries this time. That was the only part that held me up at the pick up window.   Besides that, I would just say that this location has never had a spacious parking lot. I ended up in the Albertson's lot where I could find a spot to eat. Overall, this is still a very good In-N-Out location and it was a pleasure to stop back in and see how it has held up over time.   4-stars overall!"}
{"text":"When this place first opened I was a bit concerned because the level of customer service at ANY store near or inside Metrocenter usually leaves much to be desired. However I must say that IN-N-Out has defied the odds and continues to impress me with the way they run their business. Friendly employees, fresh food, and great service are the reasons I continue to visit there (even though I loathe Metrocenter overall). Think about this; they dispatch a person outside to take orders if the drive thru line is too long to make sure your order gets in and you don't leave frustrated.  Really.   Would ANY other place do that? Not a chance. Also, out of all the times I have been there, they have NEVER gotten my order wrong. I am a bit picky with my food and I never have to worry, I can trust them to get it right the first time. The employees are CLEARLY paid better wages than other burger joints which means something to me as well. They are happy to be there (for the most part) and this is evident in the level of service they provide.   My ONLY, and I mean only critique of this In-N-Out Burger location is the shall we say, interesting, way the drive thru is set up. Series of cones to direct you in and when you get out you are in a parking lot of Burlington Coat Factory with many people (usually) walking in the lot. Other than that, this place is a great place to stop in and grab a burger.   Oh and the inside is constantly being cleaned up and I have not seen a \"bad\" time to go there. Obviously pretty much always busy, but that is to be expected for the service they provide and the excellent food they make."}
{"text":"A decent In-N-Out location that is VERY busy.   After getting my car washed I decided to give this location a shot since I am an avid In-N-Out fan. While I wasn't disappointed in the food, I found the overall experience to be average at best.   First off, the location of this place is in a very tight corner on Bell Road. Going into the plaza, I miscalculated which way you actually get in two times. There are several driveway entrances that take you into the plaza, but not into In-N-Out. Eventually I found the right way in, only after I left the plaza and entered in again just before the light.   Even though it was close to 2pm in the afternoon, the drive thru line was insane. Adding to this, there were cones used to direct people in their cars, making it feel like I was waiting in traffic or in a construction site. It took a while to order, and eventually someone had to come out with their pad and take orders while we waited.   Once I got the food I was fortunate enough to find a place to park and eat. The food itself was fine, but not quite as fresh and hot as other locations. Almost like it had been made and was waiting for me for a while on a counter or something. Also, sauce and cheese was smeared all over the box, meaning that I had to worry about setting it on my passenger seat.   While I'm not angry or anything, I found this In-N-Out location to be a bit disorganized and sloppy when compared to others I've been to. The service was fine, but the food, parking, and drive thru were all enough to make me question whether or not I would actually come back. I'm not sure I would to be honest."}
{"text":"Great food, terrible parking.   The food at this location is delicious. The service is speedy (for as busy as it can be), and the staff is generally friendly and accommodating. However, the parking gets so busy, sometimes you can't even find a spot. And that sucks.   The lines at this In-N-Out get SUPER long and sometimes you will have to wait to place an order. The people who work there are pretty efficient overall, friendly and competent. But if you aren't dining in, you may have trouble finding parking between 11:30am-1:30pm.   I've come even later than that and STILL had problems parking. Not sure why this is the case, but folks should be aware of it. Use the lot at A Loft Hotel across the street, or the lot in the plaza next to the In-N-Out. Those are the only alternatives.   Sigh.   Of course I'll be be back, who am I kidding. Their fries are amazing."}
{"text":"On the 7th day, God made In n Out. Best burgers ever.   This location is no different. Excellence in every way. Will always be a regular visitor."}
{"text":"Got served by Donald, very efficient. Probably best In-n-Out service around my area."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with In n Out even when they get your Oder wrong...   They fix, refund, accommodate and deliver your correct order to your table.  And I love my grilled onions with my burger!"}
{"text":"I'm not really a big fan of \"in n out\" but I am somewhat of a burger connoisseur so I will give credit where credit is due and this place has great burgers... Fresh and fast..good job!"}
{"text":"My 100th review!  In N Out is consistently amazing. I was craving In N Out on my 9 hour trip from San Francisco and they didn't disappoint. I arrived and one of the most satisfying meals ever. Double Double with animal fries... oh yes. Amazing.  Now that I'm back on the east coast I will continue with my In N Out withdrawls."}
{"text":"Yes we are a fan. Yes we go here EVERY trip to Vegas. Long lines but they move FAST! Great burgers. Yummy fries. Small selection but then again they don't need a lot of choices. Sooo good for fast food!"}
{"text":"Try the double double animal style!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here nearly every week for the last 12 yrs. They have NEVER messed up my order. Never. It's always clean. Food is always fresh and good. Simple,  easy,  delicious and friendly. If you haven't experienced In N Out then you need to. Not your average fast food burger."}
{"text":"I love this place. No words can describe how much I love In-N-Out and wish there was one in Chicago.  Every time I am anywhere near an In-N-Out, I always make a stop.  Sometimes I make a stop 2 days in a row. IT's that much of an addiction.  Everything here is fresh, the fries are real potatoes that you can see being cut and it tastes so much better.  Yum......."}
{"text":"Protein style well-done.....going, going, gone! Every time it's the same for me.....the grilled onions are a MUST! Just recently, I added the indulgence of Animal-style fries to the order. I'll never go without again! As for the chain, I know what to expect and am never disappointed. As for this location, I was greeted with a smile, given prompt service, and found a nice clean booth to have one of my favorite fast-food  lunches when visiting AZ."}
{"text":"#1 fast food ever. Drive thru can take a while. I prefer to dine in just because the fries lose crispiness in the bag. If you come with a food companion, get their order and have them save a booth. Seating can be tough.  My favorites:  Neapolitan Shake- vanilla, chocolate and strawberry coarsely mixed and it is truly a pleasure. No fruit chunks in the strawberry either.  Animal Style Fries- don't be a fatty, share. Loaded with spread, grilled onions and a slice cheese you will need a fork and a wet nap. We usually get these and a regular fries to offset the guilt.  Double-double Protein Style- sure the bun is good, but you know what's better? Tons of thick, crisp lettuce that doubles as a \"burger cup\" if you will. I go light on the onions because if you don't it's way too much. The cheese oozes all over. If you have no dignity you can eat large chucks off the wrapper. My husband calls it \"cheese paper.\"  Now if you get regular fries you have to ask for the spread when you pick up your order. Get a condiment cup from the napkin station and DIP DAT!  The most ongoing pleasantry of dining here is the delicious stink you get on your hands. Don't wash it off! It's a gift. The curse of eating here is the gas. Sorry, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Ate here last week while on lunch. Other than the long line, is there really anything to say?? It's In-N-Out people, it's delicious! Can't go wrong........."}
{"text":"Simple menu, great fries, clean and friendly staff. Be prepared to wait and eat in your car if you go at lunch time."}
{"text":"Been there twice.  With all the hype you'd think it was out of this world.  I found the burger to be dry, small and overpriced.  Frys were overcooked and flavorless.  BLA."}
{"text":"Far from the CA headquarters, this particular location tries but misses the mark of the usual standard.  Unattended bathrooms and a harried, albeit friendly staff don't quite give the same great in-n-out experience, but you can't blame them for trying."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great burgers and fresh fries and good pink lemonade! The drive Thur is not too bad. And the seating area is nice and clean!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place. It's eating nostalgia. They did a great job with my burger and cheese fries. My husband loved his animal style. Despite the daunting line, we got our food really fast and I don't have a single complaint about it."}
{"text":"Does this In-N-Out need more positive reviews? Probably not, but it can't hurt.  Truly, In-N-Out itself is a west coast legend that everyone must try once. Their burgers are fresh and delicious, their process is incredibly efficient, and their restaurants are always clean. Their unlimited refills of pink lemonade are, after their burgers, one of the best things they serve here.  And this location in particular is incredible among In-N-Out locations. The staff is always friendly, the food is always excellently prepared (not poorly assembled or badly cooked like some other locations), and they always do an admirable job of cutting through the wait even when there seem to be endless people ahead of you.   Will always, and hopefully forever, return."}
{"text":"Rediscovered a lost favorite, been lured to Whataburger as it's close and convenient but never again. In-N-Out blows Whataburger out of the water in cost, quality, and convenience.  Even with the longer drive and the drive through backed out to the street and then some  I received my food faster and fresher/hotter than I would have with the1 mile drive to the Whataburger not making that mistake again."}
{"text":"I made my limo driver take me though the drive thru at this in and out. That was quite interesting give their oddly shaped drive-thru lane.  Usual In-n-Out fare, which is to say excellent."}
{"text":"10 minutes off plane and ordering a #1. Freakishly great."}
{"text":"Lots of fun, helpful staff. Wish there were more t-shirts with other color options."}
{"text":"This is always the last stop I make before heading out of Vegas. Drive buy grab a burger fries and a drink and head straight back to LA. Keeps you up and is a great hangover cure to get you back to LA."}
{"text":"Not a bad burger for the price. I think this place is a little over hyped. I prefer Mighty Fine or Five Guys, more expensive yes, but the quality is better. We went here after a night of drinking and decided to go in and wait. Looked like a waiting room for Chris Hansen's pedophile round up. I do enjoy the little hats the staff has to wear."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with an in and out burger. My personal favorite is the proteins style, animal style cheeseburger. This is not on their menu but you can always order it this way. The chocolate shake is my favorite chocolate shake anywhere!  Although there is almost always a line in a short wait, it is well worth it and moves quickly!"}
{"text":"My first visit to IN-N-OUT burger was just as advertised.   Several of my friends told me that if I ever had an opportunity I should take advantage of it. I was in Phoenix on business and had just enough time to stop in for lunch on Saturday.   The food was fresh in the service spot on."}
{"text":"Clean fast and fresh.  Can't argue with that.  There is a new In and Out opening in the strip by the Flamingo, FYI"}
{"text":"We went here today for the Coffee Crisp UYE (my first Yelp event!).  Both my wife and I got a Double Double. I got mine animal style (pickles, mustard, and grilled onions added) and she got hers regular style. We also each got an order of fries well-done (extra crispy). I really like In-N-Out and this time didn't disappoint.  The first time I had In-N-Out was when I was in middle school (late '80s) and we stopped at the In-N-Out in Barstow on the way to a field trip to Magic Mountain. This was before they had In-N-Out in Las Vegas. It was also before I was aware of the secret menu. In-N-Out shirts were considered very cool back then, so it was as much a requirement to get a T-shirt as a burger when we stopped.  I learned about Animal Style in college and have gotten my burger animal style every time since then. They are so tasty and juicy!  Unfortunately, I didn't learn about well-done fries until a couple of years ago. Until then I hated In-N-Out's fries as they always tasted like cardboard to me. I very much prefer my fries crispy and, as long as they are well-done, I now like In-N-Out's fries. I've yet to try them animal style which looks and sounds good but just seems like too many extra calories. Someday I'll give them a try.  Anyway, back to the UYE. The only person from Yelp I have ever met before is Misti Y., so I had no idea how to meet up with everyone. I looked around and finally saw an empty table with a box of Coffee Crisps. I headed over that way and Peter A. introduced himself. Several other Yelpers soon joined us. I'm not much into sweets, but I have to say the Coffee Crisps were really good. They were just mildly sweet which was perfect for me. They reminded me a lot of wafer cookies. It was fun to finally meet some Yelpers, and I look forward to more events in the future!"}
{"text":"this was our first time at in-and-out.  We hit up the place in Tempe for a meal once we got to Arizona.  It is worth all the hype if you looking for a little better fast food but it is still fast food.  There was a line around the entire building but the weather was nice so we sat outside and people watched."}
{"text":"Always a classic where ever you go and always the same consistency.  The food was great and the service just as good.  We ordered four grilled cheese animal style and animal style fries.  The experience was awesome as usual especially at 10 pm.  A great late night appetite quencher.  Just be wary getting down to this location on the bus from the strip is easy, but there is quite a bit of wait on the way back.  So definitely recommend a Uber or Lyft to return."}
{"text":"Crazy busy! Not sure if it's because the food tastes good, or because it's one of the cheapest place to get food in Vegas. In my opinion, I think it's the latter.  I got 2 hamburgers: 3/5 - which were just ok. Nothing to write home about.   The secret menu fries which they call Animal fries: 1/5 - toppings consisted of cooked onions, cheese and a sauce that tastes like the thousand island salad dressing). Fries were soggy :(  Don't think I'll eat it again."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is an In-N-Out, only difference is it is in AZ which until maybe ten years ago wasn't so. My buddy used to come to Cali and go right from the airport to In-N-Out but now he has one in his own back yard to gorge on. I like to order a 3X3 protein style when I come here after a good workout. If I am having fast food this is the place to choose for sure for a burger. Clean location, good service, a little slow but why rush excellence???"}
{"text":"I had a craving for fries and rather than paying outrageous resort prices, we decided to head to In-N-Out Burger. Went to the drive-thru which was very quick and responsive. We ordered a #2, an extra cheeseburger and upgraded our combo to a chocolate shake, all for under $10. Hello cheap and tasty! I wish all decisions in life were as simple as the menu. The fresh hand cut fries just need a little salt to kick it up a notch and I am a happy camper. No matter what kind of burger snob you might be, the price and quality of In-N-Out Burger really can't be beat AND the staff is really nice and efficient. We don't have In-N-Out where I live in Honolulu, but gosh I sure wish we did!"}
{"text":"After a long day watching the Dodgers at Camelback Ranch and watching a movie at the Glendale Drive-In, you'll get hungry! With me being hundreds of miles away from Los Angeles, there is no better place to grab a late night snack than at In-N-Out in Phoenix.  Located on the shopping center with Michael's and Staples on 28th & Peoria, you'll find SoCal's famous In-N-Out in Arizona. A couple hours earlier, there was a car crash and on that intersection and tons of local law enforcement. When I came back around 12am, there were a lot of Arizona Highway Patrol cars at the In-N-Out. It looks like a lot of them were taking their break. There were even more when I left. I didn't eat in since there were more coming in. I guess you can call this a temporary HQ for the Arizona Highway Patrol.  It had been awhile since I ate anything at In-N-Out. So, I ordered what I use to order: a 3x3 Burger ($4.35) with everything on it and Animal Style French Fries ($3.50). I didn't realize that the Animal Fries was put into the microwave with the cheese. If I have to describe what it tastes like, then you really need to add In-N-Out to your bucket list.   Yeah, there are tons of Sonic locations, but if there is an In-N-Out, you know where my priorities lie! I still dream of a 100x100 challenge, but I am not sure if I want to add that to my things to do. Maybe I'll keep trying out more of their not-so secret menu.  Do you think I write too much? Well, you can call me a Yelp-O-Holic!"}
{"text":"This is In-N-Out.  As it's name implies, you are not there long.  You weave your way to the register and place your order.  A few minutes later, your number is called and pick up you sack of deliciousness!     One of the best bargains near Linq and Flamingo.     Don't forget the \"secret menu\".   You don't have to order what is on the menu board.     Now, is this the best fast food burger?  I don't know.  There are so many choices.   But for overall speed and quality, they do a damn good job at a great price."}
{"text":"Have to admit when I gots the craving for a cheap BUT good burger I head to in and out! Fast, Fresh and oh so satisfying. What I love about them is the menu and the prices stay consistent not like all the fast food joints! They also don't jump on the bandwagon to try and get all fancy Nancy with their ish!   On the menu for our meal tonite: 5/5  2 Double Double Animal Style 1 Double Double Add Pickles 1 Plain Cheeseburger  3 Fries Rootbeer, Coke and Lemonade  Service: 5/5 Fast and with a Smile  ...can't get any better!"}
{"text":"Long line on a Monday night at 9:30, and I can't understand the appeal! I went there because I was told the burgers are better than an average fast-food chain. How wrong was that information! Their burgers taste exactly like a Big Mac! While I am not a huge fan of Five Guys, at least it's better than this."}
{"text":"I've been going to In-N-Outs my entire life. They are a place that is so simple and so enjoyable. I personally have not had many bad experiences when I have been to one. It's a place that I truly can expect quality work of food.   Having friends who have worked at this establishment for years has helped me learn about secret menu items and methods of ordering.    My personal go to meal at in-n-out is a 3 by 2 (3 burger patties and 2 cheese slices)[one of those cheese slices being cold] with a WHOLE grilled onion, extra spread on the top bun with a side order of LIGHT WELL fries. And when I'm feeling it-a vanilla shake.    Another thing I do appreciate a in-n-out is that they serve Kona coffee! It's one of my favorite types of coffee."}
{"text":"Second time they screw up my order and gave me someone else's!!!!! Why man... The fuck can you guys just get drive thru orders right?!?!?!??!??!? C'mon!!!!"}
{"text":"Okay. These guys are the best when it comes to the late-night rush (4 cars in the drive-thru at 12:30 AM). The late-night crew is super friendly, even with my ridiculous \"custom\" order: Animal Style Cheeseburger, extra tomatoes, no pickles; Animal Fries, well done; and a chocolate-strawberry shake. No complaints, ever!  But inside, it's hectic and jumbled all the time (except for post 11 PM). 3 PM post-lunch slow down? Not here. Expect at least a 25 minute wait for food on the weekends.   If you've never eaten at In-N-Out, you're missing out."}
{"text":"First time eating at this restaurant.  Back east we have a similar burger joint called five guys, In-N-Out is far superior. The dining area was immaculate,  it was jam packed, so the staff did a great job making sure everything stayed clean and well stocked. Employees were very friendly.  Living on the east coast we really aren't used to being greeted with a smile and a hello. So it was nice to see young kids with manners. I couldn't believe how reasonable the prices were.  We fed 4 adults and 2 teenagers for under $50. Everyone left full and satisfied.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"In-N-Out Burger does not compromise on quality.    I can count on freshness and speedy service.  I'm 100% satisfied with one cheeseburger, French fries and a small root beer.  From a soft top, grilled hamburger bun, homemade beef patty, cheese, crispy lettuce, sliced tomato and onions, and potatoes, all I taste and see are fresh ingredients.    Burgers are perfect in size and tastes very yummy!    Fries are crispy.  Hooray for no salt!  There's an option to add salt.    I love it when a fast food establishment holds true to their vision and mission.  Try it!  Winner!"}
{"text":"Steps to a enjoying successful In-N-Out Burger.   1. Get drunk first, this will help your enjoyment of the burger.   2. make sure its late at night so that you are surrounded by more drunk people like you and less teenagers and families.   3. order the double double animal style (with fries and a drink if you are feeling fancy) and get it TO GO.   4. Drive (or if you are too drunk have someone drive for you) home. At this point, you will start to smell the tasty scent of fresh burger with onions and cheese. You are probably dying to rip the paper bag open and devour your burger. but resist. enjoy the smell build-up and tell your burger how much you are going to enjoy eating him/her when you get home.   5. get home and open your burger. Hold it with both hands. For epic classiness, make sure both your pinkies are raised because, after all, you are a lady/gentleman who knows who to eat a burger properly.   6. Make sure you have drowned your burger with extra SPREAD (the thousand island sauce that you have to ask for when you get your burger TO GO). Let the spread and burger drippings fall down the side of your mouth and lick your fingers once you are down.   7. Calm down. control the foodgasm- other people may be watching you and getting the hell creeped out."}
{"text":"Inn n Out burger taste the same no matter what location you go to . I give inn n Out 4 Stars based on fast food quality. This location based on parking I'd give 2 stars , it sucks to get inn n out of this place but the drive through line moves pretty quickly even when it's backed up.  The cleanliness of the place  is descent but it could be better !"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like the classic, all-American burger with fries and a milkshake? In-N-Out has to be my favorite and i've tried Shake Shack in NYC, other burger places in Cali and many other in between and I seem to come back to In-N-Out!  My typical order would be #3 with NO onions. It is just a classic hamburger with fries and a drink on the side. You can substitute your pop for a milkshake of your choice! Might I add that the milkshake is SOOO creamy and SUPER delicious! Some days i'll substitute my usual iced-tea for a vanilla shake. and all for about $10!  What is fun about this place is that they have a secret menu. You can search online and see what they have to surprise you with! I usually just stick with the classic. I do however like the animal style fries. It is their secret sauce on top of regular french fries!   If you have not experienced In-N-Out yet, you should check it out and see for yourself! It is definitely one of my guilty pleasures!"}
{"text":"The only place we will get a fast food burger. Excellent burgers, quality ingredients, clean dining area, polite employees. If only I could love your fries. It took years to find them tolerable but mostly, easy way to avoid additional calories and fat."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I LOVE In-N-Out. If it was based solely on everytime I have dined in, I would give this place 5 stars. Hands down. However I'm rating the whole experience which includes drive thru, which is a complete hit or miss. If you go at night it looks like they are understaffed and I always end up waiting for ages even though the line is not that long. Half of the time they mess up your order so my best advice is to always check that you got your items correctly."}
{"text":"Wow- this place was delicious! I can't believe I didn't know about it sooner. It was very busy though, so my husband and I elected to eat outside in January."}
{"text":"When the hell are you coming to NY. i went there in April 2010 for my bachelor party i had 6 burgers in one sitting i know i am a fat ass. wait until you taste it!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best location in Vegas. The burgers are hot and fresh. The people who work here listen and order your food and OMG its correct the first time.  I cant tell you how pleased I am with the service I got from this location. Ok yes I can lol I'm happy dance excited. Altho they didnt get to see my happy dance because we went thru the drive thru. Hmmm lucky them!  But the shake was cold and good the burger hot and made correct the fries were hot and oh so good. Best burger ever!"}
{"text":"Friendly people. Our order taker was probably frustrated at the line in the drive. INO is not entirely noob-friendly. My bf ordered \"cheese burger, everything on it, grilled onions, add pickle, add banana peppers--oh and animal style.\" Any previous or current INO employee would laugh at that too. He could've saved a minute or two had he ordered backwards as simple as \"animal style, add banana pepper.\" Our order taker also asked if we wanted box or to go. Bf was confused but I got it. Anyways, food came out fast enough and we were satisfied."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is my kryptonite! Usually it's easy for me to resist fast food chains but I just had to give in and get an animal-style cheese sandwich. I love how you're able to watch as potatoes are being cut up and thrown into the frier. That way I can pretend this food isn't **that bad,** for me.    The staff is incredibly nice and fast, I've never had a comparable experience at another fast food chain. However, something to keep in mind is that this place is always bumping, don't expect to be In-N-Out in under 15 minutes."}
{"text":"In-N-Out Double Double Animal Style with Fries and a Dr. Pepper.. Doctor's Orders!!"}
{"text":"As far as fast food goes this was pretty good. Much to everyone's surprise this was the first time I had been to an In-N-Out.  The place was clean, although it smelled like a sewer outside. Ordering is fast and easy. I had the number two. I really wanted pickles....is that even an option? The fries were ok. Everyone kept raving about how amazing their fries are so I was pretty disappointed that they were just alright. They needed the salt that was provided. The pink lemonade is fantastic. After two glasses I was ready to float away.  The food was good, fast, and cheap. I will be back."}
{"text":"Not bad. Got a double double and fries. Tasted good. Very crowded, but then again we are right next to ASU. Could account for all the young adults here."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love this place ?  I find employees here and all other locations I have been to are  friendly and helpful.   Restaurant is always clean and I love the colors;  white and red it really stands out. Its always bright in there as well.  I also like that the employees look clean and not dirty. No complaints on the cleanliness of their bathrooms either.   Everything on menu is great including their hidden menu items.  Crispy fresh fries , shakes and delicious burgers with sweet onions and big pieces of tomato along with their thousand island sauce (make sure you ask for some of those sauce packages to go) and not to mention the little yellow peppers you can get with your order  \"bomb\". The stickers that they have for the kids are fun and do entertain the kids as well. If you haven't been to one of their locations you have to check them out.  When I was visiting Colorado state I missed In N out and  I was on a hunt to find a burger place that would come close.   I can tell you that the copy cats did not compare.  In N Out still reigns."}
{"text":"I... Just... Love... This... Place...   Way better than 'water-burger'... Just sayin..."}
{"text":"We were scared by the long line, but it flew by in just minutes. Amazing prices for the burgers. The servers came by frequently to clean up, and it didn't look like anyone struggled to find seating even with how busy it felt at first. Our first time at In n Out, and we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out is standard. We went at lunch time and it was crowded (which is typical for all In-N-Outs). I was a bit suprised that my food was out right after I ordered (accidentally almost grabbed someone else's; they called 74 and I thought I heard 94). Anyways, the maximum capacity for the dining area is 71 people, so if your planning on having a party, bring under 71 otherwise your 72nd friend will have to sit outside (and no one likes to sit by themselves).  Pro's: 1. This In-N-Out is in a really good location. Right off the freeway; you can go off the freeway, grab your food, and go back on.  Con's: 1. Good luck finding a seat."}
{"text":"Tried In and Out after a year hiatus. Don't know why, just none near me or near work. Arrived at 12:45PM on a Thursday and there were 35 inside plus 25 cars lined up around the corner.   Ordered a Double-double Animal style and small drink for $5.19. The menu is small but they are good at what they do.   My sandwich arrived in seven minutes, fresh and hot. To you noobs out there: don't take it out of the wrapper. It's too juicy, stuffed and fresh to hold up without it.   My burger was animal style, which means grilled onions. The bun was toasted with lots of crisp, cold lettuce, sliced tomato, pickles and relish plus thousand island dressing. Very messy.   Never a complaint here. The fries are good too, I just wasn't hungry enough for them."}
{"text":"When I travel to California or Arizona, I live to eat In-N-Out Burger! Even thought I inevitably regret eating it, like all fast food, it's still something I crave because we don't have it back home. I tried to get my Uber driver to stop here on the way to my hotel, but he adamantly refused because of the 20-30 minute wait for you food. I guess there are a lot of students that go here, so the drive-thru line can get long. One of my co-workers was nice enough to bring me back about 30 minutes later, and the wait was nowhere near as bad as my Uber driver had argued. We went inside to order and got out of there in under seven minutes.   Cheap? YES. You can't beat the prices. Friendly? YES. Unbelievably so, and I wonder if it's a cult. Delicious? YES. At least the first half. Worth it? ALWAYS. Still my favorite fast food stop ever."}
{"text":"I've heard so many wonderful things about In-N-Out Burger and finally had the chance to taste it tor myself. There are very few selections to choose from (burger or cheeseburger). I chose a cheesebuger with fries. It was a nice sized sandwich, smaller than the gigantic burgers that most places love to show off these days. One bite and I was instantly hooked. I hadn't even finished before I was making plans to come back. The burger was perfectly cooked, the toppings were fresh-the flavor was amazing! I'm not a big french fry eater, but they were ok. Nothing fancy. I will definitely make a few more stops to In-N-Out before leaving Arizona!"}
{"text":"I am impressed. This is the best In N Out I've ever been to!   There was initially some confusion with our order (lots of amendments on our end) and they get everything PERFECT. A+ for you. Also, my bun was perfectly grilled on the inside. Fries were crisper than I've had most places including other In N Outs. Service was super fast and friendly as In N Out always is.   I did find it a little odd that they had an employee taking orders at the drive thru. Usually they only do that when it's really busy, and it definitely wasn't. (It was around 2:30 on a Sunday).   They could move around their parking lot signage to make things a little clearer, but other than that, this was great!"}
{"text":"Never a bad meal at In-N-Out. Swing by if you love cheeseburgers because it's fresh, tasty, and a mouthful of goodness :) (if you're hungry go for the double double).  The milk shakes are awesome as well. They have vanilla, strawberry or chocolate. I would recommend going off the menu and requesting for the Neapolitan Shake. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Hits the spot - try the Spumoni milkshake and animal style fries with a double double"}
{"text":"It's usually not that bad of a wait but it's worth it every time. I always get a double double then take off stuff and add stuff and it's always done exactly how I want it! I wish I liked their fries more so I could get more full but man it's a darn good burger. I wish these were in Colorado. I also wish it was open just a little longer so I could get it after work around 2:30 am. But it's probably a good thing it isn't. Great company."}
{"text":"I've been an extremely envious East coaster for years hearing about the amazingness that is In-N-Out Burger so when I finally found myself out West this was my first stop after the airport (I realize that sounds a tad pathetic but it was lunchtime and I was on a plane for 5 hours). I was incredibly happy with a double-double and fries. The sauce on the burger was delicious! I haven't had it in a while now but I'm itching for some more!"}
{"text":"You gotta love my early yelp reviews which says nothing but a few words just like my original review for this In-N-Out location which only said \"Its OK.\"  Though I would've loved to kept the review as only \"Its OK\" and possibly seeing my face on sites that diss yelpers I had update my review for F.U.C. sake.  If you 're craving some In-N-Out and don't wanna wait too long at the always crowded Tropicana location definitely hit up this locations.  It is only a few miles south and you're basically In-N-Out as you should.  No 50 or so taxis, limos, or drunks pedestrians in your way. The main reason for the review.  Because this is located in a shopping center there are lots of parking spots to dine in your car, which the Tropicana location lacks when busy.  I'm not a huge fan of In-N-Out but I do occasionally enjoy their burgers which are pretty good for fast food burgers, then again so is Carl's Jr.  I do not eat their fries and think they're terrible.  I am not a fan of \"secret\" menu I'd like to know what my choices are especially from a fast food joint.  People do enjoy ordering from their secret menu so that's cool but because I don't really know what's on secret menu so I can't really increase my rating. Maybe next time I'm there I'll ask the employee to order me a meal of only items from the secret menu.  One of my few words reviews updated now on to the next."}
{"text":"Great A burger! Now I know what I have been missing. The burgers are great and fresh. The French fries are to die for and I am serious. Please bring In and Out to Florida."}
{"text":"Great for the price. Expect a long wait no matter what time of any given day it may be. Try a 4x4 if you're feeling bold  PLEASE ADD BACON TO YOUR MENU!!!!"}
{"text":"Coming from the east coast, I was super excited to try out the \"best\" fast food chain that the west coast had to offer. My west coast friends would constantly rave to me about the juicy cheeseburgers and amazing animal style fries that I had to try. As such, those were the things I ordered. Here's what I found...  Pros - Lines were long but orders came flying out  - Service: Although a fast food chain, workers smiled and someone even came to clean up our plates  - Price: The best part. Two \"cheeseburgers\" (animal style is free) and animal fries (not free - surcharge of $2) for $11. Not a bad deal to get you full   Cons - Fries were soggy. Even the ones at the bottom not soaked in cheese were soggy :(  - Burger was good but not great. Lettuce and tomatoes were fresh but the patty was very thin. Bun was the saving grace. Maybe getting a 2x2 or 3x3 would've helped.    Overall: The food was definitely better than McDonalds but I'd prefer five guys or even shake shack. Five guys because their fries are much crispier and burgers can be customized with many more toppings. Shake shake while more expensive, has a better beef patty and much better tasting fries. Personally I think this place is overhyped but maybe it's just the one in Vegas. Will give it another shot when I get to California."}
{"text":"blah,   I tried In & Out once in LA, but I was with people in a hurry and couldn't really remember my experience. So, I decided to give it another try in AZ. (I'm from the eastcoast) Honestly I have no idea what the hype's about. The burger was alright, but just too damn greasy on the buns I have no idea why my friends don't eat McDonalds but eat this stuff. I almost saw no difference. Not sure how I feel about this place. It's good, just too damn greasy in my opinion."}
{"text":"Brought my sister in law from Canada. She loved it.  Since it's at trop the waiting time is very long and crowded compared to other in n out in Vegas. They have second building for ppl to sit out and eat but with the hot weather soon it's not that useful. Price is unbeatable and taste is... speechless. Overall, close to the strip but long wait time."}
{"text":"I admit it -- I had high expectations going to In-N-Out for the first time. I heard great things about their burgers, and I was hoping to get blown away. I was not. Now on the plus side, I love watching whole potatoes get smashed through the french fry press. That alone was worth the price of the meal. In fact, I'd love to get one of those for my house. But the burgers? Not so much. I ordered the double-double, and it was OK, but not really unique or outstanding in any way I could taste. For my money, a Big Mac is not something I can easily replicate at home (unlike the double-double), and the Burger King Whopper just tastes better. But that's just my two cents. I didn't hate it, but I certainly can live without it."}
{"text":"Never ever disappoints .. I have to say inspite of the rush, they manage to stay on top of their game .. They make you feel surprisingly welcome and I won't say that for most fast food places .. They taste continues to be legendary ... Kudos to them for sticking with the basics and being so damn good at it"}
{"text":"I'm just writing this review because one time my husband was getting an order in drive through to bring home for us, and he forgot his wallet and they let him have the food anyways and he went back and paid the next day. We thought that was just so nice of them. It's close to our house so we eat there all the time now."}
{"text":"All In-N-Outs are pretty much the same; format, menu and service. However, the service was something extra at this location. The buser was very friendly asking if he could grab customers water and going above and beyond. He even got in a selfie and took a photo with our family who were In-N-Out virgins!   The service was fast and they stayed true to there name!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. Always providing fast, good food. Nothing changes & that is what makes this burger spot so awesome!!! This location is always busy & they have never disappointed, worth the long line!!!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place!!! They messed up my order back in October, & not only did they go above & beyond to correct it... They sent me a Christmas card with a free meal!!! I love that they are all about customer satisfaction, I would have Never stopped coming here just because they handed me the wrong bag!!! Nevertheless even after I came in returning the wrong meal, I was compensated & pleased. Then 2 months later they send me a Seasons Greeting card with a complimentary meal!!! I LOVE YOU IN & OUT...."}
{"text":"Never had a bad expereinece.  Always fresh. Wait times can be a little long, but it is worth the wait for the fresh food."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas I make several trips to this location.  I can't get enough of their amazing food.  When I am home on the east coast I am almost constantly thinking about this place."}
{"text":"This location never fails on the customer service.  They are nice...  And... I love the burgers... and the cool language. :)  Protein style: no bun Animal style: grilled onions in sauce, can go on both burgers and fries Dry: bun, meat, and cheese only Grilled cheese: two slices of melted cheese Double meat: this is obvious 3x3: 3 meat patties 4x4: 4 meat patties (you might get a heart attack with this one as well... yikes!)"}
{"text":"I love In & Out but after waiting 35 minutes when the line wasn't more than 2 cars past the ordering menu is kinda ridiculous. And to add to it, my food was cold..straight from window, I grabbed it from the box and my fries and burger were cold like they have been sitting there.. I mean I know the price is affordable but not worth it if they keep it up like this"}
{"text":"I had to stop by to see what is all the hype is all about. For the price and speed, it is a amazing burger. I wouldn't say it was the best burger. It was a okay burger. I was hungry too and I thought that would enhanced my tasting experience but not really. I think the over hype of this burger made me expect more than I was hoping for.   I would definitely give it another try. Maybe not this same location but another one. I was told other locations are better."}
{"text":"Nasty. Take out equals soggy fries and I've tried a few of their burgers. Yuck! I decided to give them a fair shake and dine in. I will not be going back. I'll be sticking with Smashburger."}

{"text":"Sometimes I wonder if it's the hype that makes this meal so special on each trip I make to Las Vegas, but all I know is that it's an absolutely required stop. My usual selections at this ALWAYS busy location include (off the not-so-secret menu): Double-Double Animal Style, Fries Well and a chocolate shake. Yum! Viva Las Vegas and Viva In-N-Out!"}
{"text":"Not usually a huge fan of fast food, I had to see what all the fuss was about! You always hear movie stars that go to In and Out Burger after awards shows so I needed to see why! Let me tell you, this location, maybe all of them at twelve noon is busier than BUSY! I know, it was a week day, lunch time and all that but the line was way out the door and way out into the parking lot. NOW we really had to try it! The line went quick considering the mayhem but the wait to get the actual food after ordering was awhile. Then you have to stand around the crowd to wait for your # to be called out.  I will say, the burger I had was worth the wait but do not waste your time and money on the fries, but that of course if my opinion. Glad to see that they use fresh fries and you can still see some of the skin on them but they were limp, under seasoned and I am 100% sure that the oil they use to fry them in is not near hot enough. I could not finish them. McDonalds still holds the fry trophy. This location has a merchandise store next door to help with overflow parking and seating for those who want to sit outside to eat. let me tell you, you do not want to attempt to eat one of these burgers in your car, not even if you have a rental! Messy goodness! Thumbs up on the nicely valued burger (yum to the extra onions and juicy tomato!) and the pink lemonade. Thumbs down on the long wait and the underwhelming fries. SIMPLE menu - burgers, burgers with cheese, fries and drinks."}
{"text":"Prices are slightly marked up here, but let all visiting Californians rejoice as they stumble upon this shiny In n Out, conveniently located on the strip!   Stop by and order your usual (my personal go to: burger w/ chopped chiles) after a long day of shopping or clubbing, and this will seriously hit the spot. My friends and I ordered to go, and I devoured my food before we were even halfway home. No regrets."}
{"text":"Being from the midwest, In-N-Out is a must for every visit I make to Cali or Vegas. Just so happened I was with my brothers for this trip. For some reason I let my little brother handle finding the location.   We walked from The Palazzo to this location. Because reasons.   10/10 would walk 5 miles total for animal style everything and shake."}
{"text":"Okay, when I'm wrong, I'm wrong.  I was out in Las Vegas again in August for a bachelor party, and after getting a 4x4 Animal Style with Well Done fries, I have to say, In-N-Out IS better than Five Guys."}
{"text":"Excellent fast food burgers ! First experience with in-out burger."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what is so special about this place. Yes it is fresh but it doesn't taste any different than half the other places I've had burgers. Fries were ok. But I still prefer McDonald's fries or Freddy's fries. Prices are cheap and if you have kids it's a deal. I guess I'm just not a big fan."}
{"text":"YOU GUYS! We need one of these in Minnesota! Yes we do!   My 7th time in Vegas and I like the LINQ promenade, lots to do and plenty to see. It was my first time going to an In-N-Out Burger and I was so impressed with everything that it has now moved Shake Shack down to number 3 instead of number 2. In-N-Out is now my number 2 burger spot in the US.  Ok - we actually managed to find seating inside! Mainly to avoid the pigeons. Just kidding! It's hot in Vegas and air conditioning is good. I snagged us a table after ordering and husband stood in the waiting line to fetch the food once our number was called. Once our number was finally called it was like heaven was speaking to me....\"FOOOD...go fetch your fooood, it's hot and fresh waiting for yooouu\" - well not really but almost! We ordered our Double Doubles \"animal style\" and our fries \"animal style\" too! Found out that meant the Burger patties are fried in a mustard sauce and Thousand Island dressing and fried onions are added on afterwards. Woah. I've never had an appreciation for Thousand Island quite like this before! The fries arrive the same way AND with melted cheese on them. Double woah. Where the heck have you been all my life In-N-Out? Oh, on the West Coast.   I thought it was better than Jack in the Box and Carl's Jr. and creeping on up there on my burger list it was, fighting the others down, down, down. Even the hats were so cool we asked for one, and they gave us a few as we left. Please for to open up in Midwest. Pretty please."}
{"text":"Amazing! excellent, OMG you guys are so fast, one of the fastest ones around Arizona. The services was marvelous and friendly, The food was superb, I Will! return, I have tried almost In-N-Out in AZ,  this one is one of the best TWO THUMBS UP!"}
{"text":"The staff is always nice and friendly here. The food is always delicious! Very fast service. Inside of the store it's always nice clean. Steph is very attentive."}
{"text":"This place is always busy but never fails to deliver great food. Always fresh and you can see everything being made. I'm never disappointed when I come to this location customer service is always good no matter how busy, food is always fresh."}
{"text":"Unhappy! Yes they have great fast service and very friendly! My daughter was eating her burger and spit out a piece of wood! How would this wood get into the meat?! Extreamly unhappy want want to pass the word around. Whatch out for whats in there burgers!"}
{"text":"Maybe I just went on an off night, but I was NOT impressed with their burger and their fries were disgusting.   Being from Chicago, I think my expectations for burgers was a bit higher and I had heard so much about this place, but I was let down greatly by the cheeseburger I got.  On top of that the best way I can describe the fries were that they tasted like someone had tried to rip off McDonald's fries... but they were stale and not hot. Gosh, those fries were icky. They ruined my appetite for the burger and had me wanting to drive to McDonald's just to have a different taste in my mouth.  I can say that I would never go back here. I'd rather hold out for some Portillo's because In and Out was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"After a 30 minute wait for food decided to cut our losses and leave.  Manager did try to give us gift cards. . No thanks won't be back"}
{"text":"I went back here again today since I was lounging around on my day off and got 2 cheeseburgers, just as good as usual 'animal style'"}
{"text":"Best \"cheap burger lunch\" on the planet. Fries are made fresh cut in house. I have never eaten a bad lunch here for the last 8 years! Scottsdale also has an in and out on Frank Lloyd Wright. Expect long lines in the drive through with 20 min wait if you get there at noon. Seating can also be limited because of the demand."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. That burger I ordered was amazing. The sear on the meat was great, and the lettuce was crispy."}
{"text":"One of the few fast food cheeseburgers that I like. The fries with Thousand Island are great too. I love the simplicity of the menu, cheap prices, tasty burger and fries, friendly service, the option to customize your order with the secret menu, etc."}
{"text":"Employees are nice, repeat your order to make sure it's correct, and they're fast.   Good pit stop before you head back if you're driving back to LA"}
{"text":"As someone who regularly comes to this location I was surprised to have gotten such a negative response from the runner outside. It was very busy and he was probably frustrated. But none the less he was very rude and not what we expected."}
{"text":"This is your pretty standard In-N-Out. It's well run and things work like clock work. It takes a little while to get your food but that's because they don't premake anything like other burger joints."}
{"text":"Gold, just gold.  You can't do a better fast food burger, in this joint always gets it right, what a great staff here and I'm glad I live next to this one!  #GO PIERCE JOHNSON"}
{"text":"''We stopped in here yesterday brought here by my son before my other granddaughter and I had a plane to catch and head home and leave Las Vegas; A double cheeseburger, fries and a strawberry shake to top it all off was great as far as fast food goes?  Service was excellent; ''Thank you''"}
{"text":"Solid branch with no complaints from my time here. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and that was despite the crazy Sunday rush."}
{"text":"Burgers for four. I cannot provide photos because after running around all day and stopping to eat, we ate so fast that there was not enough time to take photos of lunch. This place is consistently packed each time we come to Vegas. Nevertheless the staff was friendly and fast that it was hard not  to be impressed by how good the food is at In-N-Out Burger. We give it for 4 stars because they do not provide milkshakes or onion rings which were a requested item for our crew."}
{"text":"I LOVE their burgers.  Classic and tastes great all the time. I can't get enough of protein style hamburgers."}
{"text":"In N Out is the best place to get a burger.  The food is always great and the staff is friendly and nice to deal with.  This is how fast food is meant to be done.  Best place to go every time."}
{"text":"This store has huge volumes, parking can be a little difficult, but they do their best to keep up.  When busy they put an order taker in the drive thru to get a head start on orders. We got 3 doubledouble animal style, 2 fries, 3 shakes for $20.81.  Burgers are pretty darn good, and they wrap it good to help keep it from becoming a messy disaster.  Shakes are thick and tasty too.  Chief complaint, fries are dreadful.  I swear they were better 3 years ago.  Last year we came in, and a worked overheard us complain, and she brought us a fresh order, and they were still dreadful.  And they were the same this trip.   I cant put my finger on why.  Yuk.  Did they switch something up? This store has a gift shop attached, if you're looking for inexpensive vegas brand memorobilia, this is a good place for it."}
{"text":"THE BODY AND BLOOD OF CHRIST???  Um.... no thanks...   I'll just take a cheeseburger and a chocolate milkshake.  :-)   After two, much needed evenings of \"good clean fun\" ie: no Jack Daniels involved...My friend and I decided to decide to stop somewhere for a quick bite to eat, before going our seperate ways.... IN -N -OUT BURGER IT IS!! The menu is simple, the food is \"fast\" and it dosen't make me feel nauseous after eating it..(unlike most fast food) .. Well.... until tonight anyway  BEHOLD.....  Bottom of the cup says John 4:16: - Ted's \"diet\" coke (pussy)...(MY milkshake had Proverbs 3:5:...mmm mmm good) It appears I'm the last person on earth to notice this.... huh??  I wasn't \"moved\" to decipher the citations, as I don't entertain this sort of  (ahem)  nonsense... however, I did get a pretty hearty chuckle (ok, bordering on hysterical laughter) out of it. ..... Private ownership and operation has it's privileges I see....  I must admit...I often get personal enjoyment out of being in the presence of people or establishments that test their freedoms.... (apparently since the 1980's in this case) and this time was no different. Smiles all the way around..  I will say this...most people are idiots..  (incase you've been walking around with blinders on since birth)   and while I don't particularly enjoy being harassed while jogging down the street, minding my own business, by a couple of fellas in nicely starched white shirts and bicycle helmets..(the purpose for which I can only assume is to keep them from banging their fragile skulls into the pavement) ..I am smart enough to know that it's not my duty as a human being to entertain THEM either...       or even acknowledge their existance to be honest..it IS that simple.... this whole cup thing seemed pretty passive to me.. and it gave me something to rant about while I ate..(not that I need help with that)  Well done IN-N-OUT..... you irritated the shit outta me......you got under my skin.... you HAVE a voice......kudos to you. Will you still see me in your drive thru???         Of Course... Why??      I oddly respect what you're trying to pull off..... and...well.... you have one GOD DAMNED TASTY CHEESEBURGER ..."}
{"text":"LOVE in-n-out. You won't want to go to this location at lunch time if you're in a hurry. But man oh man is it worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is great place to eat. The food is fresh, cheap, and flavorful. Not to mention the a lure of the place as a rare fast food joint. Don't forget to Google their secret menu!"}
{"text":"Love the cheeseburger with extra lettuce. The veggies are fresh and they have great arnold palmer drinks."}
{"text":"\"A 5 star fast food hamburger joint?\" Yes.  \"Named 'In-N-Out?'\" Yes.  Insert copulatory motion joke here, if you must, but In-N-Out is more than just another euphemism for \"the motion of the ocean.\"  It's the best damn hamburger joint on the West Coast. Period. End of sentence.   The \"double-double animal style\" with extra mayo and fresh cut fries cost under $6 and yet are a better meal in my mind than meals I've had in LV for 20 times the price.   The fries are hot and crisp, but not hard. They are flaky and steamy starchy salty sticks sent from a loving New Testament kind of God.   The \"double-double animal style\" burger means it has \"hand-leafed lettuce, tomato, [two] mustard cooked beef patt[ies]; add pickle, extra spread with grilled onions.\" [http://www.in-n-out.com/menu/not-so-secret-menu.aspx]  Now, that's a nice sized burger. I'm 6'1\" and 205 and I left some behind. Not because I wanted to.  Kids: listen to Unca Paul on this one. In-N-Out has a funny name and serious food.   Not to be missed."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend after going to see ip man 3  Star 1 is for the food quality. Food is great here as always, especially animal style.  Star 2 is for the service. The people here are all so friendly and very quick considering the amount of people wanting food.  Star 3 is for the atmosphere. The fun environment and friendly staff make this place great.  Star 4 is for the food being worth the price. I got two double doubles animal style and fries animal style for 11 bucks. My eyes are way too big for my stomach because I ended up taking a double double home, but it was a good price considering the amount of food I got and the quality.  There is no 5th star because I wasn't really wowed by anything. It was a good experience but nothing that really stood out and made me say wow."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS DELICIOUS DELICIOUS!!!  I'm from Florida so the closest thing we have to IN-N-OUT is Five Guys or Shake Shack, so let me just say that IN-N-OUT exceeded my expectations!  I have been dying to try IN-N-OUT since the celebrities I follow on social media are always getting it. So I was excited to know that I had one right next to my hotel on the strip. When I first arrived to Las Vegas I checked in to my hotel and went straight to eat. The lines were really long but they move extremely fast and make sure you pay attention to your meal number as they don't go in order.  I got the cheeseburger meal with a vanilla shake and OMG it was to die for! I love how crispy the bun was from them toasting it and how packed my burger came but not sloppy at all. I hate have to bite into a burger and all the ingredients are falling out because it was overstuffed and everything becomes a mess. With this burger it was no problem. The milkshake was thick and creamy. The animal fries were fantastic!!!  I went about 5 times during my 3 day stay because it was the only fairly priced meal on the strip that was worth what you pay! Only problem I had was the attack of pigeons in the outside seating area that never left your side lol. But I demolished my food quickly so it wasn't a bother.  Thank you IN-N-OUT for your great food and amazing service!!!!!"}
{"text":"Been here many times and just couldn't get enough! The lines are very reasonable and the service is fairly quick. Food is the usual yummy and reliable burger we all came to love from in n out. It's tricky to get here because you must enter from  N 83rd ave. it's not connected to the mall and you can't enter from Bell."}
{"text":"It is In and Out Burger it is so delicious it is almost pointless to leave a review everyone knows it is awsome already."}
{"text":"Soooooooo good! Love the animal fries, or grilled cheese. They have a lot of options besides what's on the menu, just ask."}
{"text":"I don't get it. I by no means disliked In-N-Out Burger, but there was no choir of angels singing while eating their burger, which seems to be the common theme of In-N-Out fanatics. Countless years of build up made me expect an explosion of flavor that would take a dozen rolls of paper towels to clean up. Instead, I left full and clean.  I only had 2 items, a Double Double and an order of fries. Normally that wouldn't be enough to judge a place on, but when their menu consists of pretty much 1 other item (shakes) I've tried 66% of their menu.  To be fair. It was a good burger. I enjoyed it. That's it though, good. For years, I've practically heard that this is THE burger. You know... The burger Jesus would eat on the day of his resurrection. The burger that would send Republicans and Democrats running through the streets together, smooshing beef and cheese on their naked bodies. It was good, but nobody's going to be fishing burger meat from their butt crack. If I was in the mood for a fast food burger, In-N-Out would be just a smidge behind Five Guys for my first choice. Personal preference, I know.  I'm not even sure why I didn't love the burger. It was great meat. Juicey and tender. There was a good amount of cheese. It was a deliciously soft bun, toasted with love. The thousand island spread... It's thousand island, I could have done without it. They don't carry mayo, which is something that may have increased my enjoyment, but not a ton. I even enjoyed the presentation, as the wrapper made it easy to eat. It was a good to very good fast food burger.  The fries. Well, their fries are actually kind of miserable. I shared an order with my girlfriend and between the two of us we might have eaten 20. Somebody else ordered them animal style, which I tried, and even that wasn't anything special.  Everybody was friendly, the service was good (a bit slow, but not awful), and the place was very tidy.  At least now I can say been there, done that, when it comes to In-N-Out. I think if you enjoy burgers you owe it to yourself to at least try them, because with the army of fans they have, there's a good chance you'll become a new recruit."}
{"text":"This place has great prices, simple choices, and the food tastes awesome!"}
{"text":"All I'm saying is that this place has been extremely hyped up and when I finally get to try it... I leave disappointed. The burgers tasted good and the fries were okay but it wasn't all it's been hyped up to be. The best part about it was that it was way cheaper than everything else in the area."}
{"text":"The secret menu. The freshness. The quality. Animal Style. Legendary. You've heard of In-N-Out Burger, sure. But if you haven't been there you probably are wondering \"Is it THAT good? I mean it's \"fast food\", how good can it be?\"  I'm here to tell you that it's that good. And then some.   I'll spare you the rundown on what INO is all about - the \"AxB\", the \"secret menu\", fries cooked to order, Animal Style -  you can use the Googles for that. I'm just going to tell you that a Double Double Animal Style is perhaps the most delicious burger in America, and the Animal Style Fries are gratuitous, glutenous goodness.   One thing to note is that while INO seems like \"fast food\", it is anything but. Food is cooked to order, and combine that with it's popularity and frequent long lines means a wait for your burgers. But that wait is SO worth it. In-N-Out was a must stop for me every time I went to California for my last job, but it had been about 5 years since I had an INO experience. For some reason, it just wasn't on my Vegas radar. I will no longer make that mistake on my future visits to Sin City."}
{"text":"It was pretty good! You definitely leave the place satisfied and the staff was really nice!"}
{"text":"Sometimes it's just the simpler things in life which stand out, and when I can enjoy a delicious lunch for under $5, I'm a happy girl :)  I LOVE this hamburger, and I generally don't eat red meat 99% of the time.  For I&O Burger, I am forced to make an exception with zero regret.  I recently read that some of the countries top chefs were polled as to their favorite fast food pick.  I&O Burger won hands down.  A single burger without cheese, grilled onions, substitute mustard for special sauce.....pure heaven!  And, this location has a nicely landscaped drive-thru...not sure why I noticed, but it was a pleasant wait for a perfectly prepared burger and fabulous fries."}
{"text":"Still one of if not my favorite Burger   and I have to get one every time I am in  a state with InNOut as we don't have them in Seattle  so from down town take the bus up the strip too Dean Martin Way then cross the street & catch the 201 west bound and it will let you off just across the street from this InNOut  Had me a Double Double Animal Style and some fries, oh yeah the Tummy was sedated for a few hours, wish I had Animal Styled the fries also, oh well next time baby   right next door just across the lot at this location they have a gift shop with Hats, Shirts, Back Packs, Travel Mugs, and Jackets plus a few other little gifts to show your InNOut Pride"}
{"text":"In n out burger never disappoints, and this location was no different. Yes they are always busy but I am always amazed at how quickly you get your food considering the amount of people that are always there. The employees are always extremely friendly and seem happy to be there and the food is always excellent. Double double with animal style fries is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night around 10pm and there wasn't a line for once!  I decided to order the way Kenji at SeriousEats suggests: Double double, animal style, with onions two ways and chopped chilis.  I also asked for no pickles.  To go along with that I got fries animal style and a root beer float (yes I'm a fat fat person).  The burger was fantastic, I could have eaten two of them.  The peppers they have in the condiment bar are spicy and a great addition!  I probably wouldn't get animal style fries with this burger again, it was just too heavy.  The root beer float was good.  5 Guys is my go-to fast food on the east coast, but when I head west I make sure to stop at In-N-Out."}
{"text":"Not much to say that hasn't been said...  This was my first In 'N' Out experience... Certainly not the last...  Their burgers are good, fries good... Yum Yum.  Gimme some."}
{"text":"This is what I consider the best of the the \"fast food\" burger joints, except it's not really that fast.  Very simple and tasty menu, with secret ways of ordering.  Try the \"Double-Double, animal style\" sometime....yum!  You can baiscally get burgers, fries, sodas and shakes here...and that is the whole menu.  All the locations I've been to have pretty much been the exact same...slow and tasty!  Oh, and they are open LATE!"}
{"text":"I first tried In-N-Out Burger in CA years ago. The Chandler/Price location in Chandler, AZ is top notch. Burger is hot, lettuce and tomato are cold, bun is always fantastic. I like the single cheeseburger best. Customer service is always top notch, and when the line is long, there's always a smiling person w/clip board out there to take your order and speed things up. They are heavy on the pleases, thank yous, and my pleasures...just excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"What can you say about In-N-Out that hadn't been said before?  Nothing!  Just go, eat, enjoy; animal sytle or not - just go!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fresh burger and fries, this is your place. The meat is fresh cooked.  They make the fries on site. Very limited menu, just meat and potatoes.  They do this one thing very good.  The place is clean and friendly.  There are always lines, a testament to their popularity."}
{"text":"Lesley Sierra was my cashier, and she was on it 100%. She served me quick, asked about my day, offered me water while I wait for my order because she knew I just got off work, and she even handed me my order personally. She deserves some recognition for her AMAZING customer service. I come in here all the time for past year but she defiantly stood out from the crowd !!!!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place on the west coast. Pretty darn good, cheap price for cheese burgers, insane quick service even though the line is crazy long. Obviously not the best burger I had but when your cheese burger is $3.50 and the ingredients are fresh, I really can't say much. It's obvious why this place is a hit on the west coast!"}
{"text":"This is my first visit to an In-n-Out Burger & it was a bit unique for a fast food joint. Quite nice on the inside with a VERY limited menu. We had the Double Double Cheeseburgers which were good (i.e., better than McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, etc.) but not as good as Five Guys or Carl's Jr. The fries were nice and fresh & unsalted.  A fun place to visit, but only occasionally."}
{"text":"I never give fast food a good review but they have their shiz figured out here. There was a billion people there Friday night yet we moved through pretty quick! Also the food was good. Sometimes fast food can feel heavy due to grease but it was great here!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best fresh burger in town.  Went to shack shake and they are twice the price and there meat isn't fresh like in and out.  Go here if you want the best burger in town and the best fresh fries"}
{"text":"No better fast food burger exists.  IMHO the 3x3 is the perfect meat-cheese-bun ratio.  Tremendous quality in every food product they put out...like real ice cream shakes!  I only eat a few burgers a year from fast food chains, but once again...I want them all to be from I-N-O.  There are certainly better restaurant burgers out there, but I was inspired to post this because I just had a restaurant burger that failed to compare to I-N-O."}
{"text":"Growing up in socal, inn-n-out is the standard in which I compare all burgers to. I've had better from time to time, but for a chain, it's hard to beat. Only drawbacks are the long wait (they cook it when you order) and the subpar fries. Love the milk shakes, and as always ANIMAL STYLE!"}
{"text":"I love burgers and when I get a craving I go to in-n-out the stroller you my number one spot to hit up late at night I haven't tried the one in California yet but I'm sure take just as good as they are"}
{"text":"Animal fries for around $4. It's feels like a double charge! Still really great good! Cleanliness is a great priority here! Just a little confusion because I didn't get my drink cups right away."}
{"text":"I don't understand the cult like following. It's a skinny patty on a bun, accompanied by the usual toppings. The fries are so thin that they cool off quickly. Entirely average to sub par."}
{"text":"5 stars baby. The only negative here is the drive-through is wrapped around the building but they have a very efficient system so it's not too bad. Can go inside the nice air conditioning. Remember when you order to ask for animal style it's delicious."}
{"text":"I love in and out! This particular location is conveniently located and although it gets crowded, the lines move along quickly.  You will find the same quality burgers as in other locations.  This place definitely does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Classic California burger made with fresh ground beef. We enjoy trying the unique options found online like mustard grilled burger, the black and white shake etc. Service is generally very friendly. Newbies don't always know some of the specialty items (like mustard grilled and what is and isn't on it).   Overall, a good joint with great prices."}
{"text":"WORTH THE HYPE. As an east coaster, this was my first In-N-Out experience. We came around 1pm and the place was bustling. As our Uber driver put it, In-N-Out is a Las Vegas destination in itself. Ordered the cheeseburger and was pleasantly surprised by the amount of crisp lettuce it came with. Overall, it was a satisfying burger without the greasy, weighed-down after feeling. I wasn't wowed by the animal fries but I'd definitely come back just for the burger. By far my cheapest meal in Vegas yet one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"If you haven't eaten here then you must be a vegan or living under a rock. Awesome food with great service..I Love It!!!"}
{"text":"Crowded, noisy and slow to get my basic order of burger and fries. And, after all that, IMHO the food is just OK. I really don't get the mystique surrounding this restaurant. I will give them kudos though for apparently paying their employees a decent wage."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try In-N-Out coz of all the hype and what better place to do it than Vegas for my first time. I have to admit I was very skeptical at first but when I saw the massive cue in the drive thru and inside, I thought to myself this place must be pretty good. I felt kind of ridiculous standing in line, wasting my time waiting for a burger, but the people watching was interesting. Random obese men with back and kidney tits breathing heavily and scratching and sniffing like junkies waiting for a fix. People openly drinking beer in public. Some had mullets. Others did not.   I finally got my order. A cheeseburger combo. It just looked like any old random fast food burger except it was wrapped a little nicer and the person who handed it to me had a smile. I opened it up to inspect what was inside and it had the florescent yellow processed cheese square, a slice of tomato, lettuce, some beige goo and a pathetic lumpy brown disc that resembled beef. Took one bite and decided to give the fries a chance. They were bland, but when salted or smothered in catsup, they tasted much better. Since it was so cheap, instead of polluting my body any further i decided to just trash the whole lot. I was paying for the experience not the food. This is a biased review because I didn't stumble in here drunk. I think that's where all the 5*'s came from.   On a side note these were the happiest fast food employees I've ever seen. They addressed everyone as \"Sir\" of \"Mam\" and even as I was dumping my full tray of food into the trash, the guy sweeping the floors gave me a thumbs up as I walked out the door. You just don't get that kind of love and tenderness at McDonalds. I still won't be back though."}
{"text":"A-Mazing. Food was fresh, fast, and ridiculously good. Had heard about the rave reviews and was a little skeptical. Best burger diner around! Make the trip!"}
{"text":"Love those double doubles!!!  Good food, good prices.  Always busy but quick and easy."}
{"text":"We tried a few burger joints while on the west coast and noticed this brand of burgers to be on every corner. When we pulled up at this location the line was wrapped around the building, so I assumed--this must be a good burger joint.. Umm wrong. We went inside and the menu is not that big. You can either get just a regular hamburger or a double patty cheeseburger and a few other options. I ordered a double patty cheeseburger. The burger was just ok--nothing spectacular about the taste, maybe I am missing something but five guys had them beat a 101 percent. My husband ordered a strawberry shake, and it tasted like a shake from Burger King---just syrup and ice cream. Last but not least, we placed an order for french fries and they were just gross! The fries we received were hard, crunchy, and they tasted stale. I saw the gentlemen in the back area peeling and cutting the fries to be cooked so the taste of these fries really surprised me. I am not going to spend very long on this review because I wasn't impressed and it didn't seem like this company put much thought into their food or menu."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for grabbing a quick fast food burger that's fresh and consistently good.  Even if the line of cars is long, it moves quickly.  The employees have always been friendly and helpful and there's none of that unprofessional stuff that sometimes happens with young employees at other fast food places.  (You know, the eye rolling, the yelling back and forth, the complaining about hours, etc.)  So, no shenanigans.  Yes, I am a cranky old person.  My only complaint is that a few times my burger has been pinker than I like in the middle, which is suprising considering how thin In-N-Out patties are"}
{"text":"In-N-Out is like heaven for my taste buds.  I also made the walk from the Strip, except it took us 40 minutes because we didn't realize that the pedestrian sidewalk is only on the south side of Flamingo Road so we had to circle back. It was worth EVERY second.  I'm not a big fan of cheese on my burgers (besides, there's enough on the animal style fries!), so I got a double meat, and was pleasantly surprised when I saw that they actually charged me less than a double-double would have been. So they actually do subtract out the cost of the cheese. Score!  We came here around 9:15 pm on a Monday night.. and it was PACKED. So plan accordingly.  Just thinking about that meal is making me hungry all over again, so I'll stop. Basically, In-N-Out is STILL the best fast food burger I've ever had, hands down."}
{"text":"It had been 4 years since I last ate In-N-Out Burger in SF, so my friend and I got super excited to find out that Phoenix has In-N-Out nearby a location I was visiting on business trip as well!  I learned from the last time I ate that animal style can make the food felt/taste sickening (the sauce was great..but it was way too much to have it on both burger and fries), so I strategically scaled down the animal style to just my fries :). We each got a cheeseburger with onions, animal-style fries and soda along with chocolate milk shake.  It cost just around $10-11 total for each of us but the taste and the effort to drive here solely for our last lunch destination in Phoenix was great! The vegetables in the burger were so fresh!! I love the fresh veggie crunch in each bite! I must admit that I definitely cannot have this type of food everyday or  evenon a weekly basis (given the calories and the unhealthi-ness probably most optimal to indulge in this ritual just quarterly or yearly)..but after such a long time, it felt great to reunite with this food chain again!!"}
{"text":"Close to my work, Sunday at 11am it was pretty desolate (usually this is a busy place!) so it fit the bill.  Double double animal style and Neapolitan shake.  Extra star given for fast friendly service by cute smiley people.  Prices have rose steadily over the years so I don't go as often, though I do as In-N-Out urge hits! ;)  Tip: the original SoCal locations are awesome, and outside the area places serve fairly consistent grub even if not as good..."}
{"text":"This would be the second time I've ever been to an In-N-Out Burger. The first time was in San Francisco and I definitely thought it was overhyped. However, I convinced myself that it wasn't great because I did not order my burger and fries \"animal-style\" that time. After all, everyone I know who has tried In-N-Out raves about animal-style everything. So this time I made sure I ordered animal-style fries and animal-style burger. Still, I wasn't convinced after having it that way as well. While everything seemed very fresh and the prices were damn cheap, the taste just wasn't quite cutting it for me. I just did not care too much for it. It was only okay. Great and friendly service though. Anyway, Shake Shack girl here!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try In-N-Out forever. On my recent trip to Las Vegas I made forever into now. It was everything I had ever dreamed of since I heard 2Pac rap about it back in the '90s, not to mention my partner in crime has gone on and on about them too. This finally came to fruition after walking about two miles and then also almost getting hit by a car (apparently crosswalks mean nothing in Vegas).  I had the double double, animal style, with fries, animal style and a lemonade. Absolutely amazing. The burgers were so much better than anticipated. I was so glad I finally got to try it. It sucks so hard there are none back here in Chicago. The animal style really adds a lot of flavor to an already very tasty burger. The wait was a bit long, though there were a ton of people in there. It has a very '50s atmosphere that brings a little bit extra awesome to eating at boring old fast food places. The fries were really good too. This was confirmed by my vegetarian that accompanied us. He also had the naked burger which is just like a grilled cheese with all the toppings on it. He said that was alright, but really enjoyed the fries. Nice and crispy, and hot too.  All in all this was everything I wanted. And it really makes me regret not living out west as we could have it all the time. Ugh, I want some nowwwww."}
{"text":"My first time at an In and Out Burger.  A place with a limited menu, but they make everything on that limited menu very well.      They also have great prices:)  So for a great burger at a great price,  you can't beat it:)"}
{"text":"My first In-n-Out experience.  Was around midnight this past Saturday.  Drive-thru was pretty busy so I was very excited anticipating my de-virginization (is that a word?)!!  Anyway, since I had done my Yelp research I knew what I wanted to order:  Cheeseburger, Animal-style Fries and Dr. Pepper.  When I arrived at order box, the male voice asked me if I wanted ketchup or extra \"spread\"....  Well, honestly, I cannot understand why its \"all that\"!  Perhaps if its something you grew up eating, you connect the food to a memory?  And since I didn't grow up eating In-N-Out...no connection for me.  (Kinda how I feel about certain 80's bands - they may not be the best musically but I connect them to a time or place and it makes them better - at least in my own mind.)  Anyway - sorry for diverting here to music from food.    I mean, it was edible and not greasy but, well, not spectacular food.  the pickles on burger were pretty good.  The animal fries were ok, not like anything I'd had...have never put thousand island dressing on french fries before.  However, adding that to cheese and pan-fried/browned onions wasn't too bad.  I can see stopping for the animal fries again, after a few drinks...."}
{"text":"Animal style is the best. Can never get enough of In-N-Out. Line always moves fast at this location."}
{"text":"Fav burger place EVER! Great service and excellent burgers. I wish we had them here in NJ. The double double....WHAT???? The best! I also had the animal fries....YUMMMMEEEEE!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on 5/12/13 for our last meal in Vegas.  Great burgers as always - a little disorganized here and that's why I dinged them one star - our party had tickets 28, 29, 30, & 31.  How can they serve ticket # 33 before us?  It's all burgers, so it's not like our orders were complicated!  Other than that, all good..."}
{"text":"Consistent with every other location for service, food, and price.  This location is the closest to me, which is great because there is almost never a line at this store...unlike the UNLV, Dean Martin, and Summerlin Locations, which have cars and lines wrapped around the block during prime meal periods."}
{"text":"This is the location that popped my In-N-Out cherry. And for that visit alone...this place gets 5 stars. It was incredible, and I won't go into the details because I'm sure I have embellished them in my mind over the years probably to the point of being food pornography.  This is THE iconic In-N-Out of Vegas. It's right next to the strip, and therefore, YES....IT IS ALWAYS BUSY. Go there expecting a long wait and you won't be as disappointed. They also get 5 stars for the crap they have to put up with from drunks and tourists.  This is also the location I mentioned in another review in which I witnessed a group of 4 walk up to the counter and I overheard this:  GIRL:  Can I just get like a grilled chicken sandwich EMPLOYEE:  I'm sorry we don't have any chicken sandwiches on our menu, just burgers. GIRL:  Really? I don't really like burgers, do you have anything else? EMPLOYEE: (controlling a smirk) No. I'm sorry, just what's on the menu. GIRL:  Okaaaaaaay........ummmmmmm.......I guess let me have a burger, but can I have it with bacon and avocado? EMPLOYEE:  Oh I'm really sorry we don't have bacon or avocado. GIRL: (Turns to boyfriend) Just order me something, this place is stupid! (Walks out of line and plops down in a booth with arms crossed.)  In the words of Jimmy Fallon on SNL: \"Really?.......REALLYYYYY?\"  And for God's sake don't write a review based on how many cars were in the drive-thru....In-N-Out may have ties to J.C. and Bible verse numbers on the cups, but they can't perform miracles...so stay focused on the interactions with the employees and the food.  I would give the company as a whole 6 stars if I could for low prices, quality ingredients, and insanely good and efficient service (This is the only fast food restaurant that can top Chick-fil-A).  But, with that said....Yea....The Fries....They Suck.....Any way you get them......They suck.  My standard order: 3x3 Animal style, light sauce, extra mustard seasoning on the patties, and no pickles with a vanilla shake."}
{"text":"Its like any other in-n-out burger.  The burgers are good, but remember you are still eating fast food.  It is an American tradition, so if you haven't tried it, you need to."}
{"text":"Best fastfood cheeseburger. I don't care what you say. ITS HOW I FEEL. Get the fries well done. Get a double double animal style."}
{"text":"This In-N-Out is typically busy but the staff is always friendly. I've never had any issues with the taste of the food and I usually order the animal style fries which is my guilty pleasure. You can't go wrong with the cheeseburgers here and the prices are very reasonable for the food. I recommend this for a hamburger/cheeseburger & fries fix, oh and you can't go wrong with their chocolate milk shakes here!"}
{"text":"Is the meat suppose to be raw? The patty is suppose to be flat on the grill yet there are random raw pieces of meat on my patty. Not a fan of their fries either, they may be fresh but they're undercooked."}
{"text":"I'm sort of embarrassed to admit, but this was my first In-N-Out experience! First of many. Growing up on the east coast, I frequented Five Guys and until this experience, had been too stubborn to try In-N-Out.  \"Watch and learn,\" Stacey said as she spouted off the order. She's a pro. 2x2 Animal Style, Animal Style fries, drink substituted with a Neapolitan shake.   The food was great for the price point. I still prefer a Five Guys burger, but the Animal Style fries, and Neapolitan shake were fantastic!"}
{"text":"I wish In and Out came to Honolulu. Best $3 double cheesburger on the planet."}
{"text":"Easy to access location.  Consistent and good food and service.  Love the cheeseburger with spread and grilled onions only and their fresh brewed iced tea.  An easy and inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"The menu is simple which is probably why this West Coast burger chain is so good, they don't try to do to much, they focus on quality burgers.  The shakes are excellent too!  The only place they fall short is with their french fries, however if you order them well done they are a bit better."}
{"text":"In Las Vegas? Feeling like In-n-Out? Not into lines? Don't need to buy all the In-n-Out trinkets and t-shirts? Well this is the location you need to go to. Although it's way off the strip, it is also a better place to get your animal style double-double fix. It doesn't have all the crowds and as with many other locations, the customers flow well, so there isn't really a problem finding a seat. Even if you have a large group.  The best thing about In-n-Out is their basic menu. Burger, fries, and a drink. The product sells itself. Of course I like their burger, but my favorite is their fries. How do they get them so light and airy?  It's just a great place for friends to gather."}
{"text":"Honestly I don't see all the fuss, I mean it's ok yes ma'am be even good but it didn't knock my socks off.  But I will give credit to the crew. Very polite."}
{"text":"Great experience today! Josefyn was really friendly, and I truly believed she exhibited the values we look for at in n out. Thanks!  Oh yeah and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"The usual quality you expect from an in and out. Came here after napping for 3 hours after a long flight. Very satisfying. am happy and content"}
{"text":"im a FAN!"}
{"text":"Fast service. Order accuracy is always on point. Location gets really busy around lunch time but that is almost expected. Employees are always very friendly and willing to help. I bring friends here whenever they're in town and they always are willing to go above and beyond to answer questions or be helpful."}
{"text":"This is a VERY busy In-N-Out just off I-15 at the Tropicana exit in Las Vegas.  It is easily recognized by the HUGE In-N-Out sign in its parking lot.  There is also a company gift shop store next door.  My wife and I dined in and the counter person was prompt, smiling, friendly, but a bit robotic.  The seating area was very crowded and the kitchen staff were  very busy - nevertheless, the kitchen and store were very clean (typical of this brand.)  Our burger and fries came reasonably fast and were up to their usual standards.  They also had workers roaming to pick up trays of people who had finished eating (perhaps a gentle reminder that people were waiting to be find a seat.  All in all a good In-N-Out restaurant experience."}
{"text":"I grew up in Cali, I know no other burger joints but In and Out, Fatburher and Tommy's. What else is there to know?"}
{"text":"Worth going if you have never been. There is no doubt this place is overhyped. If you are going on a weekend prepare to wait 20-25 min for his fast food. There will be a line out the door and it will take you 5 minutes to find a table.  He animal fries help make this place a little more unique from other fast food."}
{"text":"From a guy who lives in chicago, the best place in the world to eat..this place has horrible burgers. Yes, they are much better then most of the food you can get in Vegas, but I just cant understand why people seem to like them..there is nothing particularly special about a large greasy burger with the gimmick of putting as many patties on it as you want.  My parents used to own a business right down the street off of tropicana I believe and coming from green valley wed drive by this place all the time..and every once in a while wed stop by. As a kid i didnt like it that much..but then coming back when i was in my 20's to party in Vegas i tried it again and realized just how bad it is.  If you're an out of towner from the east or midwest, dont bother eating here, you can get better food at any local beef/hot dog joint. If your from Vegas or the west..enjoy, because its better then most the food you can get out there."}
{"text":"Perfect, just like everyother in-n-out"}
{"text":"Love in and out but my burger is usually 6/10 times not cooked all the way. Don't get me wrong I like a lil pink in steak and burgers are fine but when it's almost completely pink there's a problem. I'm pregnant and I don't want to get sick especially when what I eat goes to my baby. Other than that their shakes are really good and that animal style sauce is to die for! I always have to get my animal style fries every time we order from them!"}
{"text":"How can you ever go wrong with In-N-Out?!  This place is freakin awesome!!  I wish I could bathe in the spread sauce.  And have sex with a cheeseburger everyday of my life.  Maybe I can find a way to live in one"}
{"text":"I was expecting more from all the hype.  I guess it is good for the price, but I would still rather eat at McDonald's than this franchise.  Reminds me of five guys but not nearly as good.  That being said, this chain obviously has been around a long time and is much cheaper.  Good for high school and maybe college kids on a budget."}
{"text":"No stop over in on the west coast would be complete without a stop to In-N-Out! this place was quite hard to get to if you don't have a car, but we walked/hiked the distance from the strip to get here.  Burgers and fries are great, but I wished there was one closer to the strip or on the strip so it would be more accessible."}
{"text":"Worst Fries I've ever had in my life. I wanted to see what all the hype is about and decided to check the place out for myself. The fries were not cooked all the way and had been left out and were stale and awful. I think the choice of vegetable oil is what makes them taste so horrible. Even dumping the entire salt shaker on them (which they did) wasn't able to improve upon their nastiness. Also, the hamburger was like a zero carb zero nutrient (iceberg lettuce) salad put in between two toasted buns which the tiniest I mean tiniest piece of meat I've ever seen. It didn't even com close to being bun size and didn't even come close to being 1/4 of an inch thick. If they have used better quality buns and had toasted them with butter and garlic they might have tasted good, but they did not either. All in all I wouldn't go back to any In-N-Out if I was starving to death!"}
{"text":"Why I love IN-N-OUT:  - Fresh Ingredients - Lightly Toasted Buttered Buns - Creamy Shakes. If you don't mind mixing flavors, try their Neapolitan shake. It's not listed in their store menu b/c its a \"secret.\" - Extremely AFFORDABLE!  - Double-Double Animal Style. You won't see this on the menu board either. This is off their \"Secret Menu.\" - Fast and Friendly Cashiers - Yummy Pink Lemonade   Whats \"OK\" about IN-N-OUT:  - Mediocre Fries. A fellow Yelper, Ben G mentioned \"they get cold very quickly.\" I completely agree. - Thin (but tasty) Meat Patties   I love Shake Shack for many reasons. It is definitely pricier than In-N-Out, but for the quality and deliciousness, its worth it. Eventhough Shake Shack's fries are just OK, I like their fries better than the ones at In-N-Out. The meat patty at Shake Shack is also thicker and juicier.   Question: Would I visit IN-N-OUT or Shake Shack more if they (in my dreams) opened side by side?  Answer: IN-N-OUT. You get the same high quality ingredients (yes, a thinner meat patty), but you don't have to fork out as much cash! I can do without fries.   This was so worth the walk from the strip (which was NOT bad at all).  {Note} It's packed in here, but people eat quite fast. You should be able to find a seat inside soon enough. If you're going in a big group, it may be quicker for you to find seats outside.   {Tip} Their \"Secret Menu\" is really not a secret. Go on their website, click on Menu and you will see a tiny folder labeled \"NOT-SO-SECRET-MENU.\" Now you're in the loop :D"}
{"text":"Like every other middle of the road In-N-Out burger joint I've ever been to--this one was full of all the same things: way too long of a wait, a simple and perfectly satisfactory burger, and some of the nicest dang kids running the place.  I was sent on an errand from someone else, which I don't mind. Sure, I'll pick you up a burger. What I didn't love, was the huge wait. I opted not to get in the drive-thru with 15+ cars ahead of me, and instead went in. I got my order in okay, but still sat there for the better part of a half hour to wait for two burgers and a shake.  Price isn't bad, but there are at least a dozen other places I'd go before In-N-Out that are more interesting. But hey brah, if it reminds you of your childhood, then go right ahead."}
{"text":"My local In-N-Out in Chandler never lets me down. Drive thru gets a little bit crazy like they all do but I've never waited too long. You gotta get raw and grilled onions if you love onions and well done fries are the only way to go."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE to eat here!    I never had an InO burger til I was a student at UCI in 1991.  From that point on, I was hooked.  In 04 I moved east and every time I'm near an InO, I have to stop!    I got off the plane yesterday and asked the rental car lady how to get to the closest one.  I'd been once before but couldn't remember the directions.  My partner and I jumped in the car and zoomed over.  We were on a mission.  As soon as I walked in and smelled the burger grease, I knew I was home.  I showed some restraint in only ordering the cheeseburger combo (I normally get the double double).  I inhaled my food and left.    I'm plotting as to which day I'll be returning this week--and I will get that double double.    YUM!"}
{"text":"Tati started it all, with a big smiling welcome. I got the double double, protein style with onions off the secret online menu.  That means no bun, just wrapped up in fresh iceberg lettuce leafs with tomatoes and loads of flavor but no Gluten.  Wow.  When are we going to have In and Out Burgers in the Seattle area,  when???"}
{"text":"Rating this in comparison to other In and Outs.   The burger and especially the fries were SOOOO salty. We couldn't eat them at all. They must have dumped a whole container of salt on them. Wasted over $40 had to throw all our meals out.   Always check your food before you leave the drive through!"}
{"text":"This place beats any of the common chains (McD, Burger King, etc.) hands down any day.  Why go there when you can have a way better burger here.  Everything is just better.  For those that love Five Guys, which I do, I think this is just different but equally good.  I also love their shakes by the way! What keeps me from the coveted fifth star is the amount of grease left in my soggy wrapper almost every time - and in this particular visit - the fries not being the best. On this occasion my fries were the \"scraps\" and not the thick cuts from the center of the potato.   For a complicated custom order they handled it well, if not perfectly. They read your order back to you so fast I think I missed something. That's where the great service comes in. Instead of debating with me or charging me for it, they simply smiled and gave me our missing drink."}
{"text":"3x3 animal style protein style hold the mustard. After two visits, I have my order down.  Milkshake is good, but not great. Iced tea is excellent Burger is very good Atmosphere and service is excellent  but I prefer 5 Guys"}
{"text":"Every time I come out to the AZ I have to have my in and out, this is usually the one I go too since it's so close to where I'm staying, great tasty burgers cheese is so good too, the bun definitely makes the burger at in and out nice and crispy fries are ok but the burgers are so good it doesn't matter, lemonades and shakes are decent too, as far as fast food burgers go ( not including places like 5 guys) in and out is definitely the best, In and out please come to Chicago.....( Please note that in and outs are busy no matter which one you go to its a late night spot usually open late till 1am on weekends, so expect a wait in the drive thru, or inside most of the time)"}
{"text":"Gem finally goes to In-N-Out!!  After a delayed flight, plummeting blood sugar, a mile-long line & a mini melt down at the McCarran Rent-A-Car Center, I was ready to fight somebody for my first ever In-N-Out meal! I've forever heard & read about these legendary West Coast burgers & fries that we Midwesterners are not so privileged to have, but I wanted to try them first hand to see if they are worth the fuss.  1st stop after the rental car nightmare: a mad beeline to the popular Sin City In-N-Out location on Dean Martin Drive near the Strip where I had my very 1st I&O experience! I first noticed all the lovely, adorable palm trees (my fave) by the building & loved them! No palm trees in the mighty Midwest either :-(  I already knew about the cult \"secret menu\" & had my order planned out forever ago! I got a double-double, protein, gem-modified, animal-style: 2 mustard-griddled patties, lettuce-wrapped with cheese, mustard, tomatoes & pickles but held the extra spread & grilled onions. I also got a regular order of french fries & a regular, black coffee because I was exhausted from traveling.   I always order lettuce-wrapped burgers at restaurants when the option is available like at Five Guys or Red Robin, etc. When I got my meal, I inspected it & it looked like fast food artwork, beautiful! (see my pics)  The menu says their french fries are fresh cut, but they kinda reminded me of McD's fries only a lil thicker with a perfect amount of crispiness & have some potato-like, looking edges. They are completely different than the darker/limper/potatoey/natural-looking, hand-cut 5 Guys kinda fry that I love, but these fries are really friggin' good too, 4 gems!  My 2 burgers were nicely wrapped with fresh, sliced tomatoes & dill pickles in one large, solid, crisp piece of leaf lettuce with cheese & mustard oozing out of every insanely, tasty bite! That's right, it's messier but OMG more flavorful & juicy than, smh, Five Guys! I never polished a burger, let alone a damn double off that quick in my entire life! I was in burger paradise & still dreamin' about it, um 5 gems!  This I&O is bright, large, & very clean. For those of you unfortunate enough to have never dined at I&O, you place your order at the counter, your food is made fresh to order, you get a number & they call out your number when your order is ready to pick up at the counter. The staff here was friendly, the place was busy & it took about 15 min to get my food, not so fast but definitely worth the wait! Burgers at 5 Guys are never gonna be the same :-(  A lady next to me was eating food from Wendy's, and I didn't even try to hide my disapproving look! How the hell do you eat Wendy's at I&O, the audacity of some people! That's like going to Lou Malnati's in Chicago & bringing in Pizza Hut! I wanted to scream, I don't have I&O by me you ungrateful woman!!  I&O doesn't have free peanuts or all the extra free toppings like 5 Guys. But what they do offer & make are straightforward, kick-ass tasting burgers that don't need all the extra goodies, they have a really cool marketing edge aka \"the secret menu\" & bonus they sell coffee that ain't too bad either! I now get the I&O madness over these gemazing, Wild West burgers!  I came, I saw, I was In (I devoured), I was Out!! Now, I may just be inclined to catch a redeye to Megas the next time I get a craving, cuz I would do anything for...Good Food!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite fast food joint.  The burgers are so good. It's understandable why there is a line every-time I go here. If your a first timer take a look on google at the secret menu.  I like the double double animal style! I don't get my fries animal style although I have seen that done.  The fries are fresh and always good. It's better to come during off hours due to its location, if you can pick it a time.   The staff is not overly friendly but not rude either. Come here for a delicious and relatively quick meal depending on the size of the line."}
{"text":"This In N Out location is near our home, so it's convenient to stop by.  Granted there's always a line, but it moves quickly.  When they're having a rush, there's always someone outside taking orders for people in the drive through.  I'd like to compliment Larry.  He had the nicest attitude despite it being 98 degrees outside.  His attitude was so great, my husband asked me to post a review right away.  The burgers and milkshakes are always good.  Get the peppers on the side.  This is a quick and satisfying meal."}
{"text":"One of the best chains in the US. They treat their employees with respect, pay them a living wage and they in turn deliver a exceptional product.  D/D Animal style, Fries Well and an Root Beer Float is always one of my vegas trip highlights."}
{"text":"Cheeseburgers make the world a better place.. Growing up in Southern Cali, cheeseburgers are the first thing your parent fed you when you get your first tooth. Either In & Out, Tommy's or Fatburgers! So I cant find any reason or thing bad about them. Always animal style, a good friend of mine always ordered a 4x4 or 6x6 animal style when we were still in high school. Wish we could still eat like that! Hahaha, we used to order animal style burgers and fries combo \"beast\""}
{"text":"The best burger chain. Never disappoints. For this solo westbound I-10 traveler on a 2000-mile drive, finding this In-N-Out was a major high point."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with this location I frequently visit because of how close to home it is.... I will have to make a longer trip from now on. The staff is very friendly but the last three times I placed an order although it was repeated back to me correctly upon getting home the orders have been wrong. I have brought it the location's attention and still I can't get an animal style that actually has the animal style. Blue Diamond has now won my loyalty."}
{"text":"YES!! Wishing they had In-N-Out on Eastern half of Country! We were in town staying on the Strip and really wanted to experience In-N-Out. We took the Deuce to Excalibur and followed the walkway under the escalator (15 minutes) to the restaurant. You will be crossing some busy intersections but they all have crossing lights, sidewalks - so just be careful and you can save some money on Cab or Uber.   I got a single animal style cheeseburger, fries (of course also animal style also - cheese, grilled onions and their spread) and strawberry shake. The line when we arrived 11a-Noon'ish was initially short but got much longer while we were there but moves very quickly. The staff was very friendly and appeared very well organized. The food was so cheap, but the quality was still on point. The burger was fresh, juicy and flavorful, the fries were crispy and the strawberry shake was made with the \"fake\" syrup which is actually my favorite. My husband ate a double/double burger and was so impressed he had to go back and get another. We sat outside where they had some nice tables as inside was getting kind of loud, busy.    This location has a touristy SWAG shop next door and we got a cute shirt and a free glass with purchase - check it out if you stop this location."}
{"text":"I have been eating in and out since I was a kid. You can't get a better burger in the world. I love this place. It's going to kill me. But I love this place."}
{"text":"This place is good but I don't understand why the hype. The burger is always sloppily put together. It taste mushy and cheap. I like the gets and shakes. Long drive thru all the time. If you go in for a shake it's quick."}
{"text":"i love you.  so sad we don't have in-n-out in the midwest :(  haven't had a double-double in over 3 years (a crime!) and it fulfilled all my expectations.  we've already decided that the next time we come to vegas we are eating this at least once a day.   five stars!"}
{"text":"Best fast food restaurant.  Great service.  Fresh food.  Love the grilled cheese with grilled and raw onions and minimal sauce.  The fries are great when they are hot.  Fresh brewed iced tea with fresh big chunks of lemon.  Mmmm.... I could eat here everyday."}
{"text":"Oh my, THE top fast food burger joint in town.  I grew up in LA and was stoked when they finally got an In N Out in Vegas.  Now they are everywhere.  YEAH!  The service is GREAT.  That probably has something to do with the amount of money they pay their employees.  If I'm not mistaken, they make something like $10 a hour.  That must be why when I tell them NO PICKLES, I don't get any pickles on my burger.  HAHAHA  So, here's what I order when I go, just in case you're unfamiliar with how things work at In N Out.  #1 (Double Double) Animal Style (grilled onions and mustard grilled into burger) NO PICKLE, with a Large Coke.  If you're not a fan of mustard, don't worry, neither am I.  But when they grill it into the burger it's GOOOOD."}
{"text":"Always so busy yet i receive food in a timely manner   :) drive thru gal today was uber friendly                     Enjoyed the hamburger and animal style fries very much, especially after a night of drinking lol"}
{"text":"Most of my life is spent being the Salt Nazi to Scott, so when looking for foods he likes, misses, and can have occasionally, I paid attention when I learned you could order the burgers and fries here with NO added salt. Even Scott's Cardiologists and the Mayo team were surprised to learn of this lower sodium option, we sure appreciate it.   I either get a protein style cheeseburger with well done fries, or a grilled cheese, occasionally just a strawberry shake. The \"Secret Menu\" is no secret any longer, and quite honestly, I don't think their food is all that. But, if it makes Scott happy, and I can say \"yes\" instead of no, it makes me a fan!   * Photos are in the gallery, we were here about nine months ago :) *"}
{"text":"Usually this In-N-Out is a 3.5-4* experience for us, and usually we hit them up late night. Today, we went during a slammed lunch rush and I was already hangry AF. Scott has 0 idea what a carb is let alone what Keto is etc, so he literally handed my order to the kid expediting in the car park to add to his Double Double no salt added & vanilla shake; my order was:  Flying Dutchman with grilled onions, pickles, chilis on side, and a side \"salad\" with a couple of spread packets. He questioned me on the salad and I explained it is just their veggies in a fry bag, he nodded, and we proceeded to window, and off we went.   By the time we arrived home a few minutes later my hangry state had turned to sad/shangry as my Flying Dutchman had few grilled onions, most of the cheese was stuck to the paper, there was no spread, no salad...le sigh. We go to In-N-Out because they make the burgers and fries without salt upon request so Scott can enjoy them as a treat from time to time. I rarely eat burgers, and for me this was disappointing, but I'm glad he enjoyed his lunch. We will return, it is close, clean, service is friendly, it's open late, but I'll be sure to go inside rather than use the drive thru, and check my order before leaving.    4.5*  **** I'm quite literally stunned as I type this update, I was contacted by In-N-Out corporate via DM asking me what a salad was, because apparently it isn't a thing, and the nice people here had just been giving it to me?!?! Hee! Go me...   Anyway, so, they care about consistency, too, and wanted info regarding the time of the purchase, and agreed that my Flying Dutchman looked sad. Further, Kayla offered to send me gift cards which is clearly above and beyond, I'm going to add them to our donations to our bi-weekly distributions to the less fortunate, because I'm changing my rating not because of \"free food\" but because of exemplary customer service, rarely seen in many restaurants today let alone fast food joints. Color me impressed. Of course we will be back :)"}
{"text":"Fresh.  Affordable. It's In N Out.  It needs no review.  Still not a fan of their fries though.   Even if well done and Animal Style."}
{"text":"A long line and time at Thursday night 7:50 pm. But for $3.50 in Las Vegas you can find no better cheeseburger. End of story"}
{"text":"Food is okay. Just be ready to wait forever to get your food...everytime we want in n out we think twice about because they always have long lines and take forever, so be ready."}
{"text":"Great burgers, fries and shakes.  Service is always great regardless of how busy they are.  Friendly and efficient employees!"}
{"text":"Came here two days ago and I usually don't have a problem but my order had gotten mixed up. I said no tomatoes with onion. Confirmed it with the worker twice and of course when I got to the pick up window and get home I had received the opposite. No onions with tomatoes. I am allergic to tomatoes so I didn't get to enjoy the In N Out I was looking forward to. The fries were a bit cold and not as fresh as they typically are. It's constantly no problem however I come here once a week and the service is wonderful and hardly mess up an order but it's happened a lot in this past month which is annoying."}
{"text":"That's what a hamburger's all about.. ok so, i loves me some IN N out. This spot lives up to the In N out standard o greatness. However, it is the lot and miscreants that ruin my hamburger lovin time. Case in point, the parking lot is small and odd to navigate through. You will more than likely have to park in the shadows closer to the 99cent store or goodwill and make your way on foot. 2nd gripe is the panhandler/beggar crowd, now i am not heartless person who looks down upon the unfortunate. Yet usually every other time I come here i'm either harassed by them lurking outside begging for $ not food or sometimes they venture in to panhandle there which really sets me off. Last time there was a real winner who smelled of booze and filth who was asking folks in line for $$ the employee told him to stop, gave him and meal and drink and told him he could stay in the building if he would stop harassing customers. Well a few bites into his cheeseburger he starts asking for $$ again saying it's for him being catholic or some such nonsense. They again told him to stop he gets up makes a scene, yells slurs they call metro and after he gets done cussing he leaves the food and wanders outside. They had to lock him out, he eventually wandered off before metro came. Yes I know this is no fault of the restaurant just a byproduct of where they are located. However it kind of sours the dining experience."}
{"text":"Wowza. This is the best burger fast food place I've ever been to, honestly. The rating I've gave is based on the FRESHNESS of the burger (the veggies were amazing, and the bun was whole wheat! Yay!) and the FRIENDLINESS of the staff. I loved it all! My only complaint was that the burger was a bit too thin for my taste, but that's probably just me. Overall I was really surprised when I came here, and of course, it was my first time here, having grown up on the east coast. I'll be back here, yummm!"}
{"text":"I had a cheeseburger, animal style, and a shake here.  Same as the CA in every way.  I don't know if LV has a Five Guys but In-N-Out is the best option for fast food burgers, period.  Any other place that can't compete with the high quality of the meat and the speed at which they can pop them out.  In-N-Out is the only burger which I actually will tolerate American cheese, something that I've never been a fan of.  This location is always crowded because people see it from the freeway and they exit just to come in here.  When I went through drive through, I was car #12 but got through from ordering to pickup wihtin 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Average fast food burger place. Went here with my friend to try as we don't have In-N-Out in the midwest. This place was super busy with a line out the door. There was also no where to sit."}
{"text":"I love in and out burger, just not this location. I'm 100 percent sure they poisoned me. It was really busy but under no circumstances are you to serve under cooked food. The staff is great as usual but cant go back. I was sick, sick, sick. As soon as i got back in the car I started feeling it. I wasn't drinking and cant come up with any other reason why I was projectile vomiting. Ahhhhh my stomach hurt something fierce. Back to the Maryland location, plus it's less crowded."}
{"text":"Biz-ay biz-ay. Due to the proximity to the airport, this place will always have long lines. Still pretty fast service. If you have a car, I recommend going to the one near UNLV. Good luck trying to find parking here. Always cheap, fresh, and consistent."}
{"text":"Without question the best fast food burger ever!  It is the perfect combo of beef, onions and lettuce.   Always get it with a side of animal fries."}
{"text":"I just moved to Westchester. And there's an In-N-Out nearby. Not as close as I had become used to when I lived in North Orange County (walking distance) but close enough for those times when I crave fast food. Which, by the way, is not very often.   When I dropped by - it wasn't very busy. I did see a lot of tourists or people returning home to California who were probably jonesin' for their double double or whatever concoction they know and love.   I grabbed it it to-go and the staff was pretty efficient and my order wasn't wrong. Can't ask for more than that.   I really do like In-N-Out but I didn't choose where I moved because there's one nearby. That was just a bonus ..."}
{"text":"Love this in n out. Best customer service. I forgot my wallet once and I was in the drive thru and realized after I ordered. The lady at the window was kind enough to just let me have it! (My total was only $3.14) but they absolutely did not have to let me have it and I felt horrible for forgetting my wallet! The drive thru line is pretty much always atrociously long, but that's what you get when the food is great and everyone wants it! If you have time, just go inside :)"}
{"text":"Everyone knows it.  In-N-Out is the best fast food joint ever, period.  Whenever I have friends in town not from an In-N-Out market they invariably ask to go here and rarely are they disappointed.  I like a regular cheeseburger with spread and light lettuce only (I'm a purist) and I can't remember a single time they've gotten my order wrong.  Everything is always so good, and their bread is so killer.  Their secret menu (which isn't so secret anymore since they put it on their website) makes ordering fun (vegetarian friend?  you can still go to In-N-Out, tell them to get a grilled cheese.  they're totally tasty!) and anything done Animal Style is about the best thing in the world.  (Ge here for the secret menu: http://www.in-n-out.com/secretmenu.asp)  Apparently their fries might be an acquired taste, but I love the crap out of them.  I love the option you're given of wanting to eat it in your car or in a bag.  I love that if you say 'in the car,' you get a lap mat.  Man, who doesn't love In-N-Out?"}
{"text":"Classic American burger and French fries made by fresh potatoes. The burger is juicy and potatoes taste really great."}
{"text":"Never coming to this branch again! Took longer than ever to make veggie burgers and 10 people after us got theirs before when there wasnt even much rush! A guy before me had the same complaint and got his refund as he was pissed off!"}
{"text":"Employee J Colin, best customer service. Gave us hats! Hope you get him at the register!!! :) five stars for him."}
{"text":"This was my first In-N-Out experience. Everyone had been talking about the chain as if it were the second coming. The hubby had loved it in Cali, and I had never had it, so we decided to stop in on our way out of vegas. I officially don't get it. It didn't taste much different than a big mac to me. It was fine, and it was affordable, but hardly worthy of worship."}
{"text":"WTF In & Out??!!   Late dinner and a horrible experience. Apparently management goes home at dark. Sat at the order box for just about 5 minutes before I got someone, fries are all burnt and had to toss them out. Not sure what happens after dark here, but don't go!"}
{"text":"Two words: ANIMAL FRIES! Yummy.  This location is a popular one, long drive-through line and equally busy inside. Clean establishment. When we're pressed for time, we will swing by here to get a couple burgers for the fam. I usually order a cheeseburger protein style. They wrap the burger around lettuce instead of the bun.  Staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"Best burgers from a fast food place hands down. Sure sometimes it can get busy during peak hours, but they do a nice job of running through all of their guests. Fresh fries and real ice cream shakes pair well with a tasty Double Double."}
{"text":"We were so happy to hear there was a new In-N-Out Burger on the strip and couldn't wait to check it out. Coming from the Midwest where In-N-Out Burgers don't exist, we especially appreciated that we can now eat here during our trips to Vegas without having to leave the strip. We came here on a Wednesday shortly after they opened for lunch and it was packed. The line to order went out the door, so we had to wait quite a while to order, and then a bit to get our food. The restaurant isn't very big (was hoping for more seating), but it was clean, and there were a few tables outside. When we finally got our food, it was delicious. It's so great to have an affordable yet good place to have lunch on the strip-something we've been wanting for a long time. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Double-double animal style is delish. It always makes me wanting it first thing when on the west coast.   .. Too bad the one I had here in Vegas was dry, and tasted like crap. I was trying to imagine the time I had it in San Fran and was in burger heaven, but nope, crap."}
{"text":"YUMMY!  Grilled cheese.... mmmmmmmm... They also have Light Lemonade from the fountain and I appreciate that.  I do get fries but I try not to eat all of them."}
{"text":"Best In N Out in Las Vegas. They always are fast and never mess up your order. Friendliest employees."}
{"text":"I finally did it. I got to try the infamous In n Out. As an east coaster this is a great accomplishment that warranted a posting on every single social media platform I have (I may or may not have made a LinkedIn post about this).   With phrases like \"animal style\" \"protein style\" \"double double\" and \"six by six\" floating around in my head, I braced myself for an exciting menu that I would need someone to translate for me. And then I actually saw the menu. Hamburger, Cheeseburger or \"double double\" (which is just two meat patties). And fries which only come in one size. Now you can get your fries \"animal style\" which means they pour their sauce (a mixture of mayo and thousand island dressing), bacon and cheese on top.   I didn't want to get be into the hype but these burgers were fresh! Everything looked like it was just picked from the garden. The meat was well prepared and I it was honestly a great burger. One worth traveling to the other side of the country for? Nah. Chick fil A also makes great fresh sandwiches. And medium sized city will probably have their own Hipster burger joint that uses great ingredients.   The fries however were bad. The fries themselves were off. No real flavor and a weird texture. And the animal style mess on top was... interesting. No one in my group liked that nor order them again.   Super clean, great service, but overhyped."}
{"text":"I've been to In-N-Out a couple times before, but it was never that memorable...not like my first time to 5 Guys on the East Coast, where I was thinking about the burger for the rest of our trip.  Don't get me wrong, the double-double with animal style and animal-style fries was good, but not a must-eat for me.  You could taste the quality of the meat, and the messiness of the special sauce made it better.  The line was long but moved quickly.  The organized chaos of the place added to the In-N-Out experience...honestly, I think I'd be disappointed if I could just walk up and get my burger without the wait..."}
{"text":"I will have to say that the hype is a bit overrated.  It's a good burger, but not the greatest burger.  I would take it over most other fast food burgers like Mc D's or Jack'n box.  I would have to say that I enjoy it about as much as a Carl's Jr Famous Star.  I did not like the fries the first time I had them, but they have since grown on me.   I would have to say that one good thing about In 'n out burger is that you can order it any way you want and they always get it right.  You really can tell the freshness of the food, without a doubt.  The only bad thing is the wait.  If you go when it's busy, you will definitely have to wait about 2 to 3 minutes longer than most other places but they make up for it in quality.    I would also like to say that the cooks at in 'n out are the fastest moving workers at any fast food chain I've seen.  I sure hope they get paid well, because they appear work very hard."}
{"text":"Do I even really have to explain why this place deserves 5 stars? Their burgers are amazing, and you can pretty much customize them however you like. I definitely suggest to anyone who doesn't already know to check out their secret menu! I believe it's located on their website. ;) Animal fries are the way to go!"}
{"text":"My son swears by this place, everyone was in love with their burgers and animal loaded fries, check out the secret menu online before ordering, indoor and outdoor seating, was super packed and had s line however they are very organized, friendly and timely"}
{"text":"What can I say???  The food is always quality and good.  Prepared fast and always exactly as I order it.  If you are feeling adventerous I suggest trying the fries prepared animal style and the 4x4 burger.  The staff is awesome!  If all fast food was prepared and served by people like those at In-N-Out maybe then I would agree with an increase in the minimum wage.  Still not a $15 per hour job but these people do deserve maybe $10 an hour???  Ok ok, sorry no more politics!  I think I will be eating here today for lunch the food is that good!"}
{"text":"All Californians love the In&Out.. and after a stressful ASU loss a couple weeks back.. I had to get my burger on.. These workers are the happiest I have seen.. I love their red aprons and have always wondered, 'How can I get a big safety pin like that'?? LOL.. doesnt take much I guess to make me happy.. just a cheeseburger...and fries.. and oh yeah.. Id love the big red safety pin and red apron too! :-)"}
{"text":"3 rating at best. We live nearby and have frequented this store since its opened. Always inconsistent, sometimes gets its right, many times does not. My first In-n-Out was in LA in early 1980's, so trust me I know what a good or consistent In-n-Out burger is."}
{"text":"Besides the delicious burger and fries, this In N Out (haven't tried too many other locations) has some of the best customer service I've ever received.   I work in fine dining and would equate the above and beyond service provided here to the service that we are required to have in fine dining. No matter how long the line is, they are quick at taking orders and moving things along. Regardless of how busy it is, I always have someone greet me at my table and offer to bring my food out. There is always someone who comes by and offers to throw away my trash as well.   I never expected this from a fast food establishment and at first just came for the good food. I find myself returning more frequently to show my appreciation for a good company and after many visits in the past 4 years I decided it was time to express my gratitude.   Thank you for the continued great food and even better service,  Your satisfied customer"}
{"text":"When you need a good burger on a budget look no further. I don't eat burgers at any fast food location except this one. The food is Always fresh and made with quality ingredients. The staff is very friendly and keep the place clean."}
{"text":"Good, cheap food.  Basic menu, but they do what they do well.  I know that people rave about this place and miss it when they move out of state.  I can relate because I feel the same way about Whataburger which is, in my opinion, far better than In-N-Out."}
{"text":"As much as it's one of the biggest notable chains in america, you can't help but love their food.  Day in and day out, they constantly serve you great effing food for a great price. It's one of those good quality fast food that never ever loses its luster.   Double-double animal style, should be what's in your mind if it's your first time coming through those doors. Make sure you're ready for a bit of a wait, because the lines here almost never ever diminishes. Pick a parking spot, watch your ticket number, and if they call it,, prepare for destruction.  The burgers are very good, I heard even just the cheese burger without the animal style sauce is state of the art. Fries are good as well, and please make it animal style as well. Trust me, you want that to happen. Hence the term, Double-double animal style.   It's a given that at any west coast destination, upon exiting the airport, make a direct trip to the nearest In-N-Out shop. It's probably a time honored tradition,, as far as I'm concerned at least.  I love you In-N-Out! I'll see you again next time. That's for real.  Thank you for reading my review. Follow me on Instagram and snapchat: rodtorres3"}
{"text":"Not having In-N-Out in northern Oregon, always great to visit a state that does. It's usually our first stop after picking up the rental car and today was no exception. Great cashier, very nice and efficient, but the 25 minute wait for 3 burgers, an order of fries and two shakes was not acceptable. Not only were the shakes missing when they finally called our number but so was the double double. It was another 8 minutes before the last burger finally arrived. Not the norm and not what I expect at In-N-Out. Pretty much a waste of close to $20."}
{"text":"Having been away for over a year, I've love the double-double with grilled onions . The fries are great. The shakes are the best for Fastfood hands down, Yum."}
{"text":"I have an appreciation for In-N-Out simply because of how simple their burgers are. No fancy sauces, no extra flair. Great bun, fresh veggies, and a well cooked burger. I also love how the fries are made fresh. You can really tell the difference. Strawberry milkshake is a must!"}
{"text":"Long lunch line on a Sunday, but moved at a decent pass. Staff was friendly even with the place and drive through pact. Food was hot and fresh would go back but leave time for a wait in case it's busy."}
{"text":"Delicious experience as always. Being an East Coaster, I often dream about stuffing down a double double, but cannot so whenever I get the chance, I stop in. The Las Vegas location is no different than any other West Coast location, besides being larger than the average. The staff is super friendly and you can tell they are trying their hardest to move everything along as fast as possible without sacrificing quality.  Docking a star for ordering and food wait time. Not really unique to this location, but it was packed and we were lucky to snag a table (which was dirty). The sign outside says 'no delay' which is misleading as it took us ten minutes to get through the line and another fifteen for our food. I wish the hours were expanded a bit later than 1 AM. I can tell you that this place would see business at any hour of the day if they were open 24 hours, not sure why that isn't a thing since the Starbucks next door can pull it off.  This place is easily the highlight of the LINQ promenade and I cannot wait to go back the next time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"YES.  This was exactly what I needed.  Everyone I go to is a marvel in efficiency and obviously the price is right.  Make it a double and get a vanilla milkshake for dessert.  You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Took the family (7 people total) for lunch after visiting and walking the entire Pirate Fest. We were all starving.The place was packed at  2:00 p.m. but we did not have to wait long to give our orders.The young man taking our order was very friendly, polite and competent. We had trouble getting seats but finally got two tables next to each other.  The only words we uttered were ' Oh my God, this is soooo good!' We were all so engrossed in the deliciousness of fresh, hot, juicy burgers. The line at the counter just kept growing but orders came out fast. My only complaints were the fries and the lack of seating for larger parties. Fries did not seem fresh, lacked crunch and flavor. The place is not large so seating is limited and saw families and sports teams  not able to sit together. Good thing it was not 110 degrees out so some parties sat outside but even those  tables are not large enough for parties over six. All in all, one of my favorite burgers ever. I will return OFTEN!!"}
{"text":"Shout out to Leah who's out here taking orders today she's super sweet, funny and very knowledgeable. Your doing a great job Leah thank you very much."}
{"text":"It is personal policy that whenever I am on the West Coast I have to search for nearby In-n-out burger joints. If you have never been, there is a reason why they are always packed. With a focus on quality, this is the best fast food chain in the United States. You have to know going in that there will always be a line and parking lot craziness. With that said it is well worth it. If you're up for it, get the fries \"Animal Style,\" which adds grilled diced onions, cheese and a \"special sauce\" resembling thousand island of sorts. You might as well get that Doubledouble...  This particular location is just off the Strip in Vegas, really close to the New York casino. It is a bit of a pain to get there by foot but a lot of folks do it. Short cab ride also an option."}
{"text":"I know this review is gonna be posted under Las Vegas but hope my Vancouver, Canada Yelper friends read this.  Forgot Vera's, Forget Romer's Burgers, Forget Fatburger, Forget Harvey's.    In-N-Out Burger has the best burgers- bar none.  If you go to Las Vegas, make sure you find an In-N-Out.    Its not on the Strip but worth the taxi ride.  The cost for three people at In-N-Out was $18, which makes up for the cost you would have paid at any Strip hotel restaurant.  I got the double burger - and it was GREAT."}
{"text":"Double Double with cheese- drool!!  I highly recommend eating this satisyfing artery clogging torpedo at 1am after a few drinks in your belly. I can't think of a more delicious way to ingest a few thousand calories. The one on Eastern has fantastic service, albeit a slow drive through. The onions were raw rather than grilled like we ordered (boo and the reason I'm giving four stars, rather than the 5 the double double so deserves), but other than that I'm in love."}
{"text":"Why don't you open up in Hawaii?!  I know they don't want to franchise but they would do well here.  Cheeseburger combo, sandwich animal style and peppers please.  Always on the list to do/eat when on the west coast."}
{"text":"Fast service.  Good food.  Great milkshakes.  Unbeatable prices."}
{"text":"The drive through line at this location always takes forever.  However the food is worth it!!!  Can't go wrong with anything you order."}
{"text":"The secret menu is the only menu I order from. I get protein style grilled cheese, a Neapolitan shake and animal style fries.  We took our friend from Buffalo, NY to have his first experience and he was blown away.   Another great tip is to get animal style and sliced fresh onions on your sandwich!"}
{"text":"What can I write that has not been written about the greatness of In-N-Out Burger! Maybe my love is borne of the separation from it my primary residence in Dallas compels. I hope that when it opens in Dallas (yes, the plans for that are public), nothing changes."}
{"text":"This place speaks for itself. Absolutely delicious and I really wish they had locations in Colorado. You won't regret it, just do it! The line is usually pretty long but they are quick and it's well worth the wait."}
{"text":"The service at this location was great. The food was good. The fries tasted like cardboard with potato in them and/or stale. The shake was excellent because they use real ice cream. I would come here again only if the lines weren't so long, which that's how I happened to get some food yesterday. Yeah, I would definitely come here again for the burgers and shakes only. As for the fries which I know a lot of people like I'm just picky about potatoes. I would recommend this particular location. It's a lot better than the one on Sunset where I got soggy fries and a half cooked burger. Well, that was a few years ago and I wanted to give this burger chain another shot at a different location. I'm glad I did. :)"}
{"text":"I think there are only two in Las Vegas and this one was close to the strip.  I like to order my fries extra crispy and they just seem to taste better to me that way.  Great cult like burgers, fries, shakes.  Too bad they don't open a restaurant in my area in Florida."}
{"text":"The hype is real! For their burgers... Their fries though nothing special. Their burgers were great. Everything about it was satisfying. Ordered animal style fries and a regular cheeseburger. The animal style fries were good. But when you eat the plain fries they were comparable to McDonald's fries. Definitely need to try it if you don't live out here. Personally shake shack is better overall in my opinion."}
{"text":"I wish, I wish, I wish we had come back here for another meal before it was time to leave Vegas!  It was soooooo good.  Will know better for next time.  Menu is just burgers, fries, and drinks - plain and simple - but they're awesome.  You can get singles, doubles, triples, etc.  And there are different ways of having your sandwich prepared, too, but you have to look up the \"secret\" preparation styles, such as Animal Style, before coming, because they are not posted on the menu."}
{"text":"I don't live in an area where they have In-N-Out Burger, so it is one of those things I have to do when I travel to a city that has them.  If you're visiting and have access to a car, unless you want to visit the souvenir shop, don't go to the popular one near the airport end of the strip.  This one is just around the corner near the university, and the line is NOT nearly as long as the it ALWAYS is at the other one nearby (w/ the souvenir shop).  Good burgers, melty cheese, tasty sauce.  A single is more the size of a regular McDonald's cheeseburger, so I'd recommend a double cheese for the average adult."}
{"text":"This is coming from someone who doesn't live in an area that has the In-N-Out chain, but I'm giving it 5 stars.  I like the double-double cheeseburger with fries.  Love the melty-ness of the cheese and love the sandwich sauce!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this place to open since I first heard about it. I have lived in Surprise for 10 years and before this city had nothing and I would have to drive all the way to Arrowhead area just for some burgers and fries. That's a 30 min drive. It was getting annoying. I'm so happy that Surprise grew in population and now they are building all these new stores. This city is starting to develop. I'm excited! I came here on a Wednesday evening. Of course I'm N Out is always busy. The line for drive through was long so we decided to just eat inside. I ordered a double double with no tomato and grill onions instead and my boyfriend ordered animal fries. Their food never disappoints me. I also ordered a strawberry shake too. The only mistake they made was that when I went up to get my order the lady gave me the wrong shake. She gave me all 3 flavors shake. Once she realized that she gave me the wrong shake she came up to me and apologized and told me that she would make me another one with the right flavor. I didn't get mad because I understand they are new. I'm guessing some of them might be still in high school. The customer service was also really nice so I can't complain. I also like how the store is really clean too. I'm so glad they built one in Surprise. Best decision ever."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at an In-N-Out until today. We came in around 5:05 pm and ordered at 5:09 pm with Edgar RE.   We were #86 and ordered a milkshake and two fries (one animal). Our order was completely forgotten. Once we heard #96 called, we decided to go to the front with our receipt and ask where our food was.   Their response? Asking around behind the counter which they determined that no one had seen it. So we waited a full 30 minutes for a completely forgotten order...which they never apologized for forgetting.   On top of that, we also asked for waters, three times, which we never got. We will definitely start going to other burger places from now on."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place? It is my favorite fast food burger in the country. They do one thing here, burgers and fries, and they do it right. I have tried this place in many different locations around the country and it is alway consistently perfect for me.The burgers are juicy and taste like what you may imagine the best burger should taste like. The fries are thin and crispy. They are fresh cut on site and always cooked to perfection. I only wish they had locations east of the Mississippi and within any kind of a decent driving distance.  If you are a burger lover give this place a try. It will make your taste buds very happy."}
{"text":"Looking for a good burger from perfect ingredients with a really low price? You found it! Also great more healthy fries than in other places, great tasting milkshake and i would also recommend a protein style burger its from the secret menu and it means burger has no buns and its inside a salad leaf... try it!  Im also amazed by the service quality i get, ive been there in so random hours and the workers are always smiling and fun to talk with!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this establishment.  The service was impeccable. All of the employees were smiling and bubbly, no one had an attitude or sucked their teeth when you asked for something! I definitely wasn't in NY anymore!! I am stickler for good service, so I do not just compliment just anyone!! The food was amazing and fresh. I was surprised how in expensive it was because a double cheeseburger, fries, and a drink at Five Guys would have been easily $12-$14!! The milk shake was made with real Milk, not that powered stuff that other establishments use!! They need to open one in Nee York ASAP!!! Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"I love in n out. This is a good place to come when you just want a burger and fries and Neapolitan shake to wash it all down. My go to is always a double double no lettuce no tomato, bun extra toasted and grilled onions. Yum!"}
{"text":"Yeah, yeah, yeah I know super overrated! But I wanted to try it for myself and let me just say that this place lives up to the hype. I had a lettuce wrap and it was amazing my husband had the double which was also amazing (my mouth is watering) I wish we had a in-N-out in New York! Only 4 stars bc the line was so damn long and so was the wait for the food but worth it...."}
{"text":"A great choice when out west! Great food, great service, wish they would expand further east!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out is my FAVORITE fast food in the whole world!  Your meal is prepared by an army of employees in this 1950/60s themed establishment.  The meal portions are appropriate, leaving you satisfied without the gluttonous guilt of McD's, Carl's Jr, or Fatburger.  This particular In-N-Out is very busy since it is right off the Vegas strip.  The drive-thru queue runs 10+ cars at peak hours.  Dine-in orders usually take ~10 minutes.  All of your food is cooked fresh, from non-frozen ingredients.   My order: #2, animal style Includes: Single patty cheeseburger, french fries, medium fountain drink Total Price: $4.70 Taste: Delicious!  An animal style burger adds extra mustard, pickles, onions and extra thousand island spread.  The animal style request is part of In-N-Out's extensive secret menu.  Here is what you can get:  Burgers (1) animal style - see above (2) protein style - no bun, burger wrapped in lettuce (3) veggie sandwich - no meat, no cheese (4) spread - extra packets of the thousand island dressing (5) extra toast - bun is cooked longer (6) flying Dutchman - two patties, two slices of cheese (7) extra everything - extra spread, tomato, lettuce, onions (8) m by c - M meat patties and C slides of cheese (i.e. 3 by 3, 2 by 4) (9) double meat - two patties, no cheese (10) triple meat - three patties, no cheese  Drinks & Shakes (11) lemon up - 1/2 lemonade, 1/2 7-up (12) Arnold Palmer - 1/2 lemonade, 1/2 tea (13) root beer float - vanilla shake with root beer (14) Neapolitan shake - strawberry/vanilla/chocolate shake (15) choco-vanilla swirl shake - chocolate/vanilla shake  Other Sandwiches (16) grilled cheese - self explanatory  Fries (17) fries with cheese - adds two slices of melted cheese on top (18) fries well - cooked longer to be extra crisp (19) fries light - cooked in less time (20) animal style fries - fries with cheese, spread and onions"}
{"text":"In-N-Out: perhaps the only fast-food chain restaurant worthy of a Yelp review. This location is the place to get your fix in Vegas although it get a tad crowded, as in 'I've never seen so many people in a burger joint'. They have a company store so you can get your In-N-Out schwag.  Best fast food ever."}
{"text":"I am not from the West Coast, but I have lived in Arizona for the past 6 years. The only other time I had In N Out was when I was in Hollywood, it was 3 AM and I wasn't sober. So I decided to give In N Out Burger an honest try before I head back east.  I honestly don't understand what all the hype is about. Maybe it's the thousand islandish spread they put on the burger. Is it better than any other fast food place with a drive thru, sure. Is it better than Five Guys, no way."}
{"text":"Everytime we visit our family in Vegas.. this the In and Out we go too.  We live on east coast so we dont have any.  Place is always busy and food comes out fresh. Our favorite fast food family place.  Double Double and Strawberry shake all day!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are here last night as I was craving a burger and it hit the spot! I forgot how delicious in-and-out tasted!  I got a double double protein style with animal style fries and he got a regular cheeseburger. Simple, classic and simply delicious.  Each time I eat at in-and-out, it transforms me back to California when it was such a treat to get it because it was so far from my family and I. It reminds me of a nostalgic feel of getting in-and-out on rare occasions, trips before the beach and a nice cold milkshake on a hot day!   The restaurant is clean, staff were super kind and our meal came out extremely quickly! I like that you can see the workers working hard in the back to create our meals!"}
{"text":"Great spot. Clean and fast service.  Friendly workers. Not much to say here but the 3x3 was great and the milkshake left me satisfied."}
{"text":"Quick service...definitely Google the secret menu items such as the light well fries for a crispier tasty fry. It gets busy during lunch so be prepared to place your order. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Easy, fast, delicious, and the staff is so nice. While waiting for your food, it's really fun to sit by the counter and watch the staff make the fries, put together the meals, and serve the drive through. Always a solid place to get a cheap meal!"}
{"text":"Ok, what's the deal with all the 5 star reviews?  A friend and I had heard about the great food at In-N-Out for years, so we came here with positive expectations. Got our burgers and fries, sat down, took one bite, then... \"What do you think?\" \"Oh, I don't know, what do you think?\" And so it went. Folks, these are good basic burgers, but far from great. The only explanation I can think of for all the ecstatic reviews is somehow they hypnotize you as you walk in the door, and for some reason we were immune. Or maybe they put something in the drinks. Meh squared."}
{"text":"Well worth the hunt! They need to come to the east side! I wanted to go check out the crave.. And it was more then what I expected.. The menu was simple.. Learned they make adjustment of you ask for it.. Next time I'll try it! But my experience was perfect for this fast food joint. I would love to just go out and try more of their double cheeseburgers again & again!"}
{"text":"3 menu items here. Burger, burger with cheese and double burger. The prices are very reasonable and the food is as good as any fast food."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with In N Out!  I recommend dining in becuase these burgers and fries do not travel well.  They get cold fast. Why do you think they give you the option of take it to go or eating in your car??    Always a consistent product. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"The first time I tried In n Out I was excited, heard so many good things, the food was terrible. I thought it was just maybe a fluke or bad day, so I tried it again, same result.   Just don't get the appeal of this place. AWFUL fries, limp greasy and taste terrible. The burgers are bland and dry.   Just because we are TOLD something is great, doesn't mean it is, this place is a prime example.   Yuck."}
{"text":"I love In N Out.  As someone with Celiac, I can't have fries everywhere due to breaded items going into the fryer and contaminating things.  The only thing that goes into the fryer here are potatoes.  Happy day!  When ordering my protein style burger, I let them know it is an allergy burger and they change gloves and spatulas to ensure no cross contamination.  You can't get any spread on your burger because of cross contamination with buns (spread is in a tub, so crumbs get into it), BUT you can get spread on the side in a packet and that is safe.  Score."}
{"text":"Wow this in and out is fantastic just like any other one. But it is the busiest One I've ever seen. We waited in line to get a double single and french fries for about 20 minutes and it took another 10 minutes to get our food. So you if you're in a rush I would pick another location. But the food was great and the service was good."}
{"text":"You know that feeling when you're super drunk and there's nothing in this world that can satisfy you more than French fries animal style? If you don't know what I'm talking about then maybe we can't be friends or lovers for that matter. This location in Tempe has made getting a taxi home from Mill Avenue very expensive commodity for me and my girlfriends.   I love the consistency and the service, also can we mention the price!? So amazing. I take everyone to the east coast here."}
{"text":"I love me some in n out burger, I live close to this one so it's my main squeeze. The workers here are super nice and friendly. The food for the most part has always been fresh.  The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because dining in one day I saw them pour their cooked fries back into the grease to reheat and worked in a restaurant before that's not a good practice."}
{"text":"It's fast food burgers but that what in and out are Famous for.  Excellent chain order to make burgers. The ingredients are always fresh, lettuce crisp and fries burning hot. This place is efficient but there is always a line because of its location to the strip but I always come here since it's so close to my home."}
{"text":"Best \"Fast\" Burger in Las Vegas.  Secret menu's make people feel special and In-N-Out's is no different.  There is nothing more satisfying than ordering \"Double Double Animal Style - Ketchup/Mustard\" with a side of Animal Fries.  Now if only I can get out of my car after i wolfed all that down.....This place is a monthly staple on the Meal Rotation board at our house.  Can't wait until next month."}
{"text":"When it comes to fast-food burgers, In-N-Out have achieved the epitome status in the world of fast-food burger for their fresh, fast and cheap food.   The first thing you notice when you enter the restaurant is the retro interior design which gives the vibes of the 60's in California. You will also notice the classic red and white In-N-Out menu above the cashiers. The menu itself is simple and only consists of couple of items. This allows them to focus on perfecting their burger.   The restaurant was packed and there was a long line, but fortunately, thanks to their exceptionally fast service, I did not wait that long in the line. I ordered the standard number 1 order which consists of double cheese burger, fries and drink for $3.60. a very good deal!   The place was pretty clean and we received our food relatively fast. My hamburger was freshly prepared, hot and delicious. The juicy meat combined with the cheese and the sauce is the perfect recipe for happiness! the fries were decent. There is nothing special about them, they were just normal fries. In-N-out is hands down the best and cheapest burger you can get in town, I never was disappointed by them. [204 wds.]"}
{"text":"That's what hamburger is all about. I've had great experiences along with a few mediocre experiences throughout the many years I've been eating at In-N-Out. The bottom line is they win more than loose and based upon that they're a first round HOF (hall of fame) nominee.  Other 'burger joints claim you can have it your way. But can you really?  This time around got the Double-double with grilled onions and chopped peppers, hold the lettuce & tomato. A grilled cheese. That's right!  Give me a cheeseburger, hold the burger, with tomatoes and onion. My way all the way! Top it off with fresh French fries, Coke and vanilla shake and you have a little piece of nirvana served in a small red plastic tray.   Lastly, at $12 for all that food In-N-Out blows away the new-to-the-west coast \"quality\" burger joints and their inflated prices.   For full disclosure, being from SoCal I am completely biased towards this chain.  However, quality is quality no matter where one hails from."}
{"text":"Best food and best service. Now I've been to some really busy locations and some not so busy ones. This is a good average. It takes about 10-15 to get your food but it's so worth it because they get it right EVERY single time and it's super fresh! It's amazing that for not being able to choose how you want your meat, it's always juicy. I hate In-N-Out fries. I think they're stale, with or without salt. So I either make my burger a 3x3 with no fries, tomato, raw, and grilled onion or I get animal style fries and a 2x2. The parking lot is pretty big too!"}
{"text":"This place is a bit of a guilty pleasure for me. I almost always end up getting a Double Double animal style with fries and a root beer. Nice and simple. I call this lunch \"heart attack in a bag,\" as it's about the most unhealthy thing I will consume for lunch. It is, however, very tasty and always fills (or even overfills) me.  Now all praise aside, I would have given a higher rating, except that this place is a little inconsistent. I've gotten a few burgers which were absolutely falling apart; the bun was only halfway covering the innards. I've gotten some pretty soggy fries. And one time they apparently didn't understand that I wasn't eating in my car. Even after I told three people. Granted, I still ate the food. And it was still tasty. It was just rather annoying. Not like I'm paying for top notch service here though!"}
{"text":"I like eating alone. Love it. Why? Two reasons: I'm an only child and I can appreciate, sometimes, a solitary existence, and two, because I can have whatever I want. What do I want when I want what I want? In n Out. Those crazy religious zealouts have a menu even a vegetarian like me can feel embarrassed that my mouth is watering for...   What do I get? Same thing every time: Grilled cheese and Animal fries and a small drink. How much is it? $6.43. How much do I love it? THIS MUCH!!! What are animal fries? They're these beautiful, cheese covered, sauced enriched sliced potato children. Good god."}
{"text":"I have been to In-N-Out many many times and I am rarely disappointed but on this particular visit at this particular location I have to say LAY OFF OF THE SALT SHAKER.   Both my husband and I had the same complaint about over-saltiness and we pinpointed the source of the salt to either the bun or the onions surprisingly enough. We both managed to scarf down every morsel of food on our trays but the excessive salt was a bit of a food buzz-kill."}
{"text":"At first I was very disappointed at how very little choices they had at the menu, but after having a bite of their double cheese burger.. Mhmm! Best one I've ever had. They have a secret menu, but that's something you have to look online and it's really unique and good. I'd come here again."}
{"text":"This has to be the best burgers out there in fast food land iam from Florida we need some of these there the double double is amazing the fries are fresh not frozen great prices"}
{"text":"This was the first In-N-Out Burger joint I've been to and I'm sad that it hasn't spread its wings to bless the people of Virginia Beach... or just anyone on the east coast. Please, come out here. I'm begging you.  First, I wasn't expecting the menu to be so simple. I love menus that aren't overwhelming. The first time I went I got a double with fries. The next time (and the third and maybe fourth) I got my burgers protein style.  The price is good. The food is good. You can tell it's all fresh. It's very clean inside. The employees are very happy and welcoming. Definitely became a go-to place for lunch and dinner while out in Henderson."}
{"text":"This is the only fast food restaurant I eat at.  I usually come here if I need a quick fix.  That fix usually comes after the gym, when there is no food at home.  You can't go wrong here.  The burgers are great.  I always get a triple meat burger with grilled onions.  2 of them.  The young kids they got working here are are always polite, quick, professional, AND they can speak english.  I find this to be the case in the California locations as well.  They must have a great training program."}
{"text":"standard hunger games stop.  triple triple animal style with animal style fries.  Routine grease shimmer down the elbows, require immediate shower and confession afterwards but the burger is delicious for the 3 minutes that it existed."}
{"text":"Busy but quick! My parents and I popped in for dinner tonight. I've missed In-N-Out since moving out of California, and the burger, fries, and shake here were wayyyyyy better than I remember from my local spots in San Diego. The fries were especially excellent, and everything tasted extremely fresh. The fries were definitely made just prior to being served, and the burger lettuce and tomato were crisp and perfect.   This location was very busy during dinner, but they got people in and out (har har) quickly. At no time was there a line, and their servers were very, very professional and courteous.   We are just in the area for vacation, but we may stop in again! Great spot!"}
{"text":"If I could rate on wait time alone I'd give this location ZERO stars. Waited over 25 minutes tonight at midnight and this isn't the first time at this location the wait has been this long. Food is generally still good but  due to the long wait the buns can be soggy. If the business demands then keep the first window open for payments. I work in guest service and I get the fact that hours need to be cut and things happen but this is a constant slow location. I would expect more from such an established food chain with a cult following such as In n Out."}
{"text":"Typical amazing In N Out food.  Great service at this location in the drive through.  Fast, friendly and quick to acknowledge and repair mistakes.  Great experience."}
{"text":"choice #1 grilled cheese. - everything but the patty mmmm! choice #2.. #2 w/ grilled onions.   they have the best fries of all fast food joints!"}
{"text":"This location has really good costumer service; the cashiers are super patient even after I asked to half the burger. The manager was walking around and asking everyone if they needed any extra service. Sooo nice compared to other places I've been to :)"}
{"text":"Finally, been waiting a long time to have one close to home. Great location , friendly staff , and the food was on point. Fries were delicious and the burger was cooked perfectly. Pretty busy location , but that's expected since it's new."}
{"text":"All In-n-Out Burgers are good. This one tops them all. The best in Vegas and best one I have ever been to.  Everything is always fresh. The works are friendly and cool. The food is always good. This is the one  In-n-Out Burger you should come experience  to see what success is all about.   Plus any Burger joint that offers Vegetarian options gets points in my book. The way a Burger Joint should be."}
{"text":"What can i say that hasn't already be said time and time again about this California burger staple.  I left California a little over three years ago and when I'm craving a taste of home In-N-Out is where I go.  Meat, cheese, grilled onions, tomatoes and lettuce a classic and tried but true combination. An unstoppable, planet aligning equation guaranteed to provide any , man enough, consumer with a tender, juicy, run down your forearms experience. Put a double double with grilled onions in front of me and it's on, a shark weekesk feeding frenzy not for the faint of heart.  Mothers shield their childrens eyes as the carnivorous food orgy commences. A flesh ripping, sauce slurping, finger licking no holds barred burger grudge match. Like a great white shark leaving no evidence of the massacre behind, except for the random pools of sauce and gooey cheese drippings letting people know something seriously wrong happened here, something gluttonously psychotic, something delicious."}
{"text":"It's like coming home. Multiple cheesey burgery goodness plus a fancy t-shirt to boot.   Super friendly service accompanied by fresh burgers and fries.  Spot on every time. Hence the reason a lot of burger chains copy their format for success.   I heart In-N-Out!"}
{"text":"Amazing cheese burgers and awesome french fries. First time In n Iut experience and m coming back again. Fast service too"}
{"text":"Being from the east coast, never had the in and out burger, so we had to try it. We are not much on fast food but it was really good,for fast food fresh veggies and quick service."}
{"text":"love the cheeseburger protein style and their fries are light. A friend pointed out at the cup's bottom is printed John 3:15 probably explains their popularity, successfulness and most importantly, great customer service."}
{"text":"The big debate - In'n'out vs Shake Shack. Everyone has their prefence, but for me.. it would seem that I may have overhyped myself for this place.  Don't get me wrong, the double double animal style was a freshly made burger off the \"not so secret\" menu. With that in mind, it still lacked the umph that my taste buds craved.   Located off strip and def gets packed. Lines move quickly thou. I'll give this chain another shot next time I'm on the west coast."}
{"text":"Burgers and fries are consistently fresh & well prepared. They sometimes struggle with keeping the tables clean, even when they're not busy. The pink lemonade dispenser is gross! Looks like it hasn't been cleaned in ages. I definitely would stay away from that. Makes me worry about the cleanliness of all the fountain drink dispensers."}
{"text":"I was shocked that an In-n-burger place would be be given a bad review! But, here it is: The fries that I normally love were over flowing with salt! I'm used to taking salt off of fast food French fries, but this was ridiculous! My wife's was as bad.  I suppose they would have redone the fries for us had we known to ask, but obviously that can't happen at a drive through & who knew until we got home The fries were so salty, it made the hamburger saltier than usual, too Their quality control needs to be improved, I don't want to even contemplate that that's their new standard!"}
{"text":"My first time here. I try not to eat meat very often but made an exception because of all the hype. I was very disappointed. The fries were soggy and the meat was very stringy. Unfortunately not impressed. Staff was very efficient though and everything looked clean."}
{"text":"YES, I appreciate the undying love and dedication to In-N-Out Burger.  I just don't get it.  To me, the burger tasted like a somewhat better \"Big Mac.\""}
{"text":"My second time having In-N-Out Burger and it was way better then the first time. This location had excellent customer service with a clean building. I watched my food get prepared; everyone had gloves on and clean utensils/work stations. My food was displayed on the tray very beautifully for a fast food restaurant. The food was 10x better then the In-N-Out on the Strip. This location is definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Easy good and inexpensive - love mine animal style!"}
{"text":"Just 3 days till I'm in Vegas again...Just 3 days.....Soo hungry..."}
{"text":"Been going to this in and out for almost 3 years. The norm was always when they call your number you go and pick up your food. Despite being busy on a Saturday afternoon an employee named Nigel noticed my brother walking to get our food of two trays and quickly brought our trays without asking. I smell a raise."}
{"text":"I recently visited Phoenix for the first time, and the one thing I was really excited for was to try my first In-N-Out burger.  I've heard things.  I've seen the \"secret\" menu.  I've thought about what I would order.  What I did end up ordering (and eating poolside) was a double-double, animal style, with fries and a strawberry shake.  Was it messy?  Yes. Were the fries outstanding?  No, they were just A-OK Was the shake the best ever?  No, in my opinion, Portillo's has a better strawberry shake.  A-OK  But the burger?  That burger.  That mustard cooked patty, dripping in all of its animal style glory... That I'd go back for time and time again."}
{"text":"The Employees are what make this places outstanding. Very accurate order taking even though we were pretty picky and customized our order like crazy  Especially I would like to pinpoint out REASHITA(!!!!). She was just so amazing by providing us the most efficient, patient and friendly customer service. She should be promoted as she is someone that truly cares about her customers and her company.   Many people talk about In n Out in Europe due to its popularity, and I will personally keep on spreading the words!"}
{"text":"We were in Las Vegas for 4 days and ate here 3 times including on the way to the airport when we made our cab stop here on the way AND including *walking* here from Venetian despite having to go over a river and through the woods (actually over a highway and through some sidewalk-less streets).  The burgers are amazing, the fries are incredible, why, we cried, don't we have any of these on the east coast?  Why?"}
{"text":"What can you say? It's In-N-Out. It's bound to be good. I'd say this one was as good as any other. It particularly hit the spot that day, but I think it was more because I was hungry.  I will say this about the location: it's a great stop on the way to Sedona/Flagstaff or anywhere else north."}
{"text":"Their burgers are delicious (kinda small tho)  and fries are different, but good. the strawberry milkshake was delicious too, but kinda hard to drink using a straw since its too thick (thicker than normal milkshakes I've had)."}
{"text":"As your typical tourist visiting Las Vegas, I always am down to try spots you hear about that you don't have back home. On our way to check in to our hotel, we asked the uber to stop at IN-N-Out. The line was long but the workers worked at a fast pace and processed orders as quick as they could.We waited about 20 minutes for our order to come out.  I ordered 2 doubles one with animal style and the other without and a side of fries. My girlfriend ordered a double with animal style and fries with animal style. She enjoyed her order. Me, not so much. Both burgers tasted the same and the fries were just okay. I'm not sure what the hype is all about but I won't be back when I'm out west.   This location is just off of the strip so your best bet would be to take a uber or taxi."}
{"text":"Order your fries Animal Style with no Spread...."}
{"text":"Stopped by In-N-Out Burger near 28th y Peoria. We were in a bit of hurry so we got 2 cheese Burgers y French Frys to go, but parking lot crowded so we decided to eat them in car. Soo disappointed to get a cold soggy dried burger cold that had been made at least 1 hr.old. Cold cheese y meat soggy dry bun.Have eaten here many times before y not like this bad pathetic experience . Frys were good y hot.Cant believe  they served us dried out cheese burgers. I will get nothing to go from then EVER. We  ended up throwing the stale soggy burgers to the massive amount of wild birds that hang out there. If you serve burgers like that to others, word will get out y you will not have the business. You now do. This was Saturday Dec 10 th. 2017. I will check my food from now on for temperature y freshness. Not going to ever pay for garbage that had to throw away again! Don't just assume it's going to be good y fresh made because it was in the past! To go does not mean toss out the garbage to them. They are leaving! Will be watching way closer wherever I eat! Big Bad Surprise by In N Out! Happy Holidays People y  your sweet pets."}
{"text":"Soooooooooo disappointed. We don't have these in Florida so my expectations were super high. I started to give it 3 stars but figured it was unfair as I don't eat meat. The menu is no frills. I'm talking 3 different sandwiches and fries. Yes. That's it. I ordered only fries as it was my only option. I hated them. 4 stars because everyone else seemed to enjoy them and they always have a line."}
{"text":"In and out burger is a great place to get a burger and fries maybe a shake and a drink but that all you can get and that why i love this place so much there 4x4 cheese burger is awesome."}
{"text":"IN N OUT!!! i think thats pretty sums it up!!!!! If you have no tried this place you better try soon!!!! Burgers are made to order and how ever you want them! Very delicious and inexpensive for what you get!!! Be sure to try their animal fries!!!! YUMMY!!!! They take french fries and add cheese, spread, and grilled onions!!!!!"}
{"text":"Animal style, protein style, and poof, you're fat. But you actually feel skinny and great because you had a delicious burger surrounded by only lettuce leaves. It's the perfect delusion and like a rainforest in your mouth. Try it."}
{"text":"Double double, stupid line...  Pretty sure everything you could need to know has been stated.  Definitely one of the better fast food options, though with any fast food could really take it or leave it."}
{"text":"Ok. Overrated. Definitely hope this is not representative of the chain. Supposed to be one of top burger places in the states but left a lot to be desired. McDonald's would have been better."}
{"text":"Best burger you can get from a drive thru. Fresh burger, fresh veggies, fresh fries. Love that you can see each step of the burger being made. INO has nothing to hide. Burgers taste great. Why more can you ask for. Great food without getting out of the car."}
{"text":"I usually don't give reviews for fast food but I loved it here. I eat In-N-Out a lot. I live in Vegas so going to this location kind of surprised me. The busiest Vegas location managed to get my food out in less than 15 minutes! Impressive. So nice too, most of them were Chargers fans so it was a plus. (: burgers are so good but I hate the fries. Always have though."}
{"text":"Great location! It's in the same plaza as David's Bridal on Sahara! Their drive thru is very fast! I had 6 cars in front of me and I got done within 10 minutes. When I got to work, everything was really fresh and great. I either get a #1, but instead of regular fries I get animal style with both raw and grilled onions, and no tomato! One complaint about all locations of In-N-Out is that their smoothies are always too thick to drink. You have to wait a while for it to not be too thick or it literally won't go up the straw. I really dislike the fries at In-N-Out but it's tolerable animal style. The burgers make it worth coming here. You can get a 3x3 or even a 6x6 if you're hungry enough! They're only cooked well done and it's all real beef but they still make it really juicy. The flavors in it are amazing. I don't know what it is exactly but it has the perfect amount of everything in it. And the cheese is always melted as well unlike most fast food chains. I have not once gotten an order wrong here. They always have amazing service too!"}
{"text":"I must confess I am probably the only person out there who never had a notorious In-N-Burger so of course I had to check it out while in Vegas. In my defense we don't have this chain in Canada but after trying it I wish we did.   Such a simple menu, burger or cheeseburger, fries pop. That's it!!! Keeps it nice and easy. Cheap prices too!! I read the Yelp reviews and the consensus was to have a double burger with cheese and fries done animal style. Mmmmmm, ok!!! Loved the burger especially with the grilled onions which in my opinion made it. Freshly made before your eyes and pretty darn good. I tried out the fries animal style which consists of a thousand island type sauce over the fries. I found it to be messy and not my thing but I hear it is popular as hell. The burger is what won me over so it didn't matter too much about the fries.   Always a line-up and that many people can't be wrong. They specialize in the one item and excel at it so it is another gotta go there each time I fly over to Vegas. This is one place that lives up to the hype. So while you are gambling away Junior's college fund keep $3 change in your pocket and get something for your money but be warned after one bite this too will be an addiction."}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying that I almost never eat fast food. Nevertheless, I think I can list about 20 fast food places that I find superior to this one.   I finally stopped in to try In-N-Out after seeing the rather large parking lot at this location permanently full and hearing the rantings and ravings from people all over the universe about the franchise.   First, coming within about a square mile of this place will put you in a (likely life-threatening) nuclear fallout cloud of grease - so extrapolate that a bit to think about what I experienced walking into the actual door of the building. Second, I was a bit disappointed to see that they literally sell only hamburgers and fries. Why are there not a few other American fried food classics like onion rings and chicken tenders, or even a few different styles of burgers or related entrees? Third, I would say that the cheeseburger and fries that I had were pretty terrible, even as far as fast food goes. It is kind of like putting that aforementioned greasy nuclear cloud into your mouth and intestines.   This really makes me wonder why anyone marvels at In-N-Out, unless they've never had anything else. For anyone who likes In-N-Out, I would recommend perhaps a Steak 'n Shake or Culver's as a well-rounded, higher-quality, still affordable and greasy fast food place. Since this is the only In-N-Out I've been to, I can't say that there is anything particularly wrong with this location. Instead, I can confidently say that I'd choose almost any other fast food franchise over this one."}
{"text":"Paid $60 for a limo to take a bunch if us from a hotel close by!  Yes it is that good!"}
{"text":"This is the best In-N-Out Burger in Las Vegas. I have never been to In-N-Out where they have a host that takes my tray and fills my drink. I mean who does that at a fast food restaurant?"}
{"text":"I don't get it.  It's just a damn MEH burger.  What's the hype all about?  Is it because a majority of the American population are simple sheep?  Try a locally owned indy burger and live the burger life you were born to live."}
{"text":"If you need to read a Yelp review to go to In N Out, well, just go order a double double and thank me later. This is a top burger place in all the land of top burger places. Always a simple menu. Staff is great. And now I'm hungry just thinking of the amazing food that is In N Out Burger. #amazing"}
{"text":"It is the original and still the best! There are times you just have to have In-N-Out no substitutes! This location maintains the high standards of the chain from great food to clean restrooms. Love it!"}
{"text":"I love in n out. So much. The protein style is awesome as a GF option and their meat tastes better than most places I've been. (I've had burgers from a lot of places....theirs just has better freshness and flavor. And the cheese! Oh vey) Great food quality, as healthy as fast food can be. In n out will remain my go-to for a quick bite for a long time! The kids at this location are always friendly and courteous as well. Stay awesome guys!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times, including the drive-through and inside. This is a great in and out, they have never messed up my order the 5+ times I've been here.  I hate that their milkshakes only come in one size. I used to not like their fries, but they have grown on me. They are different from what you would find at other fast food restaurants.  I like their burgers because they taste fresh. They are not the greasiest or the most unique, but they just taste good.  Also, the indoors is very clean. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday evening, the place was really packed but the service was super fast and the food was great. We enjoyed our meal :)"}
{"text":"Good burgers, that have a nice grilled flavor. Arguably better than any other burger joint in phoenix at that price point! Somewhat greasy food, so bring a strong stomach. Further, the rest of the toppings on the burger where just eh....nothing unique really!"}
{"text":"First stop when I hopped off the plane to Vegas. It wasn't super busy at all. Burgers were great, just a good simple burger, and great fries. A really great meal right after a long plane ride. Can't wait until they have one in or near Seattle!"}
{"text":"This is a great \"morning after\" place to eat. It is usually packed Sunday morning with all the people that stayed out a little too late the night before.  I love ordering number 1 animal style, well done.   Food is great and service is prompt."}
{"text":"Obligatory stop at In-N-Out on our first night in Vegas after we checked into Caesar's across the street. The line wasn't too long and it moved quickly, with all enough employees manning the cash registers. We ordered some of the off-the-menu items (like fries well done, animal style fries-hold the grilled onions). Somehow our order got skipped over, along with about 10 others, but we got our food soon after we brought it to their attention. I thought maybe I had a bad experience when I had In-N-Out in LA, but nope.. everything just tasted overly salty to me. People ate and didn't linger, so by the time we got our food, there was an open table for us to plop down at. Since the turnover happens so quickly, the tables are not wiped down. All of the common areas (soda dispensers, condiments area) were cleaned and restocked often though. Overall, I'll eat here if someone requests it, but I wouldn't be the first to recommend it. Food isn't great, but the service sure is!"}
{"text":"This location is very very busy during lunch so beware. I loved that they were able to reasonably deal with it though, despite all the pressure. We sat outside because there were no tables inside during this craziness. Good quality and employee customer service were top notch as always."}
{"text":"I made a pilgrimage to this In-N-Out closest to the strip. Its located right across the expressway at Tropicana (New York/ Excalibur). You need to walk on the south side of Tropicana because there aren't any sidewalks on the other side of the street. Or you can cab it here, and there's always a steady stream of cabs coming back.   I was there about 3 PM on a weekday but there was still a line. What more can I say about the place? Great business model: simple menu, wholesome tasty food and still CHEAP! About six bucks for their double burger, fries and a drink!"}
{"text":"Very nice! I was impressed. In and out lived up to the hype! Highly recommend getting the \"secret sauce\" at check out. It's a very tasty burger with lots of flavor and you're not paying much! If you love burgers and want something better than your typical fast food. This is the place to go! (Get the fried onions on it)  Skol vikes"}
{"text":"You either like the food or you don't get what all the fuss is about.  I happen to love it.  This location is well run, but always way crowded as it is right off of I-15 near Trop. and the Strip.  Most of the license plates in the parking lot are from CA or some other state other then Nevada.  If you miss LA, you will feel at home here. Great food and people watching."}
{"text":"Look, I love In n Out. I mean who doesn't? Seriously. I hear so much nonsense from ppl saying this and that about it but let's point out a few things.   1. You get quick and fast service 2. You get a great product for a great price 3. The staff is extremely friendly and I have not once ever seen a staff person be mean or not have a smile.  4. The secret menu and what you can get done to your food is pretty sweet.   5. They have bible verses on their stuff which is awesome  My go to is a number 1 no onions, well done fries and 2 packets of special sauce. If I feel hungry I get a 3x3 no onions. Ready for my drink mix. The pink lemonade and iced tea for an arnold palmer with one pink packet of sugar. The absolute best.   I'm obviously going to return. The overall experience is great. Whether lunch or late at night with some of the crazies that come in, it's a fun time. They also keep this place very clean which I appreciate and they always check on you when your eating to make sure they can get anything. Some of this service is better than many restaurants in the valley. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Before the plane even touches down on the West Coast I begin to feel that old familiar craving and visions of animal style cheeseburgers and neopolitan milkshakes begin dancing in my head.  Arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday was no exception; I demanded to be chauffeured to In-N-Out immediately after fetching my luggage. As I sunk my teeth into this perfect cheeseburger I couldn't help thinking that all was right with the world."}
{"text":"Raised & residing in vegas, I have to love this place. In n out is exactly what can satisfy your tummy anytime of the day! Theyve never messed up an order or given a hard time. Its always a clean & friendly place. I always order a protein-animalstyle burger with regular fries, with a side of spread. Try it! Its from their secret menu. If you're a tourist, just avoid the Dean Martin location because it's always packed."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with a hamburger from here.. my go to when I need my burger fix...  Frys r good too. What"}
{"text":"Went in for a cheese burger with lettuce tomato and mayo. They told me they don't use mayonnaise. I said OK, no pickle no ketchup and no mustard, thinking I would get it plain and dry. WRONG! When I got it it was floating in thousand island dressing. I was so disgusted I just walked out and didn't even ask for a refund. If you can't get a burger the way you want it whats the point?"}
{"text":"One of the few, if not ONLY thing left from my \"once upon a time, Cynthia lived in So Cal...the land of Hollywood, Disneyland, beaches and great weather.\"  Thank you In n Out for having locations here out in the dirty, dry, desert. Your burgers and fries taste so much better than THAT other place. *ahemfiveguysahem* Don't worry, I would never go to the dark side."}
{"text":"Ive changed my mind. In-N-Out is the second best burger place in Vegas. Im on the search for the 1st. 2 words changed my mind. ANIMAL STYLE."}
{"text":"Waited so long for one burger and one fries, watched my burger sit on the side for 7 minutes while they did a large order. What they should have done was did mine first, as my order was put in first. By the time they called my order up 15 mins have passed, the burger was ice cold.  First time i wanted a refund!!! There was no team work there and I could hear the employees goofing around and even arguing with each other."}
{"text":"Its what I wanted, we took our car and drove our here to get away from the strip for a bit. Good food, exactly what you expect from In and Out."}
{"text":"I'm going to go against the grain a little here and say I don't like In-N-Out. It's not this location or the price or that the service is poor, it's that the food isn't so damn good to justify why it's ALWAYS packed. It's like a weird cult of people who don't realize they're eating a basic cheeseburger and \"eh\" fries.  When I hear people go like \"OMG we HAVE to go to In-N-Out!\", it worries me. That place is like the Scientology of burger joints. I get it though, they have their own special lingo so people feel like they're part of a special group. If it worked for Starbucks, why not this place?  At the end of the day I'm on my lunch break... I don't want to wait in unnecessary lines to get a burger. I could get a Whopper quickly and not think twice about it."}
{"text":"Excellent! I will not get tired eating in-and-out burger and good service. I will recommend to my friends and family. I like their protein diet menu healthy choices. Fries are not oily."}
{"text":"OMG the best burgers and fries in the country! Enough said but wish they would  expand to the Atlanta area!!!"}
{"text":"Everyone knows it's super fresh and super fast. Don't need a long review it's simply awesome"}
{"text":"Being from Pittsburgh, we get pretty excited when we are on the other side of the country where In-N-Out Burger's exist. We had to get one while visiting Vegas for a few days. I went with the cheeseburger and Brendan went with the double cheeseburger. The sandwich was fantastic but I found the fries to be super dry and honestly flavorless.. sauce couldn't even save them. However, the burger was perfect. Friendly staff here and a clean location as well!"}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I love this place. More than I probably should. I've always been greeted nicely, and the food quality is consistent. This is the one closest to where I live, so it is super convenient.  I've knocked this down two stars due to the parking lot. I am shocked that I have not been hit in this parking lot or on the street. This parking lot is extremely dangerous due to the long drive-thru line and the connection to the Arby's parking lot. This could be a scene out of a bumper cars game. Proceed with caution!   Something needs to be done to make this an easier and safer parking lot."}
{"text":"I finally went to in and out burger after hearing about it and seeing it on tv. I thought the burger was very good because it was simple and I loved the toasted bun. Although the fries seemed bland and dry to me. Great experience and glad I tried it!"}
{"text":"Seriously miss in-n-out. Ever since my husband and i moved to Oregon, i can not find a burger good enough to resemble. We had to stop here on our way out of las vegas and it was the best meal we had while we were there."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Some of the best fast food burger I have ever had in terms of freshness. From the bun all the way to the fries I could tell they were never frozen/ baked the previous day. I ordered the #2 meal which came with a cheeseburger, fries and a drink. The burger I ordered animal style, but not the fries. It tasted great with the extra sauce and added lettuce, tomatoes and pickles. The fries were very fresh and I wish I had them animal style too. I was happy to see that they give you a small salt packet to put on your fries to see how salty you want them yourself.  I had never seen a fast food restaurant so busy. The lines moved fast and there were always a steady line of people coming and going. They even had taxis stopping by there to drop off and pick up waiting customers.  Great location not too far the Las Vegas strip and the people working there had a great attitude about working there. They really knew how to keep the place moving. If I'm in the area again I know where to stop for my next burger meal."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best fast food burger.  In my opinion, better than Shake Shack and worlds better than Five Guys.  We came here on a Sunday at about 11 a.m.  I totally understand why the line was almost out the door.    I got the double animal style and an order of fries.  Unfortunately, I did not order the fries well done.  The fries were bland and not crispy enough.  French fries are very important to me, so I knocked off a star.   Alright west coasters - you win this one. I get the hype."}
{"text":"I went out of my way to stop here as often as possible. They did a great job at making my double double animal/protein style burger. They were always busy no matter the time of day but you are always greeted with a smile and wonderful food. This location is worth visiting for an In-N-Out burger fan."}
{"text":"Amazing.   Truly the best thing i've eaten in las vegas.   I came home from the bowling tournament at 1230am and was looking around and saw this wonderful place and ordered a double double and fries....quite possible the most amzing thing i've eaten in vegas....perfect."}
{"text":"Life Changing is the only term I can describe this.     I asked the guy behind the counter what is the normal as I have heard of IN-N-Out but never ordered it and he said double double and some fries and shake.   I got all that and really couldn't have asked for much more in life.   The burger was perfect, the fries amazing and the shake perfect.  I like burgers, but a lot of times get all mad at people saying 5 guys is good.   This place is by far the best I've EVER had.   Period.  I think you should all go here immediately and try it out.   Thank me later."}
{"text":"Everyone that knows me, knows I LOVE IN-N-OUT!  Yes there is none in Hawaii but if we had one, they would know my name as I would be going there often.  I travel to California and Las Vegas every year for the past 14 years and for the past 10 years I have been eating here at least once every single time.  Yes I truly love this burger, the place (nice and bright and clean), the people (they are always smiling and up-beat and is willing to please), and there is always one some where that I can pull up to and get my fix on.  With all that said, I will get into the nitty gritty about this place as most people know that they have a great burger, shake, and fries.  What I am about to write is what I know and have ordered at one time or another just to see which way I like best ( so far I liked them all ).  Yes, what I'm talking about is their secret menu.  Secret menu?  Yes, they have a menu off the menu you see.  It's so that the normal person won't hold up that already long line trying to figure out what you want.  Kind of like Starbucks and all the different ways to order your drinks.  Wait, you didn't know about that too?  Oh boy, that's for another review.  LOL  Ok the buns here come toasted and burgers are done medium-well.  But you can request that your bun come either no toast or extra toasted.  Make everyone that didn't know you could do it this way and say the two magic words... Medium rare and whoop there it is, a nice pink center that most don't see as they didn't know you could get it this way.  Besides the single and double, you can ask for a THREE BY THREE or FOUR BY FOUR.  Yup you guessed it.... You will get a triple or quadruple cheeseburger.  Before, one could order up to a 100 by 100.  Unfortunately, that is a thing of the past.   What, you like extra condiments on your burger... No problem as you can get extra for any burger (example for extra mustard) by asking mustard grilled. What the cook will do is put extra mustard on the top of the patty before flipping it so that the flavor soaks into the meat.  Oh yeah!  I'm sure some of you cooks out there is going to try this at home.    I'm sure here and there you will hear someone ask for ANIMAL STYLE (you can get this with almost any burger).  Animal Style is grilled onions cooked in the delicious meat juices which is combined with extra Thousand Island sauce, mustard grilled patties, and extra pickles. (btw this is my favorite at the moment but I also add raw onion, yes you can have both)  What, you're feeling that you want that delicious grilled onions and Thousand Island Sauce on your fries.  YES PLEASE, you can do it by ordering Animal Style fries.  YUMMY!  So, you are on a no carb diet!  No problem, you can ask for PROTEIN STYLE.  That's right no buns but you get your burger wrapped in lettuce.    Some Monkish people prefer to keep their rabbit food and carnivore-ish food separate.  If this is you, you can do this by ordering a SALAD ON THE SIDE.  If the employee is a newbie and doesnt know how to do this, then you can ask for extra lettuce, tomatoes, and if you want onions on the side.  To be really sneaky and get the most out of it, you can also ask for an extra packet of spread and BOOM you got yourself your own side salad at no extra cost.  Now we come to the FLYING DUTCHMAN. This is for all those who are looking for something Mr. Atkins would come out of his grave and give his stamp of approval.  Two slices of melted cheese between two burger patties.  No bunny food, no carb loading buns, just pure protein.  You could do animal style with this as well but they will but they will put the onions with the cheese but the Thousand Island Sauce and pickles on the side as it would be too messy and get all over you unless that's your thing.  Hey some of you are strange individuals.     You have a friend, (we all have that one friend who is vegan or vegetarian. Yes there is a difference) no problem.  Just ask for the GRILLED CHEESE.  You will get a toasted bun with two slices of American cheese melted perfectly between the two buns.  If you want you can even ask to get the standard lettuce, tomato, and raw onions inside.  I like In-N-Out fries but I LOVE McDonald's fries better.  If you are like me, you can order your fries differently as well.  If you want them extra crispy, just say, WELL DONE.  The fries will come out more dry and crunchy. If you like opposite 180 then ask for LIGHT and you will get that limp and oily and just add salt and there you go.  Some like the TWO MINUTE fries which is still crunchy and a little raw in the middle.  Last but not least is the shake and floats.  You have the standard choice of chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry shakes.  What you want all three?  You got it!  Ask for the NEAPOLITAN.  So you want to wolf down a nice cold one without struggling to suck out the goodness?!?!?!  Then try ask for the ROOT BEER FLOAT.  You will get a half cup of root beer topped with a swirl of vanilla soft-serve"}
{"text":"Employees are nice and work pretty quickly to serve the thousands of cars in line. Love it!"}
{"text":"I would give ZERO stars If I could. This disgusting location, complete with filthy tables, floors and staff, was not only rude, they betrayed and belittled myself and my family. TEN calls to corporate (they are above giving you the location direct phone number) and even three tweets to them, no reply. They show no concern. I will spare you the other hideous things we observed at this location, for fear they will sue me for slander."}
{"text":"This In N Out had a longer-than normal Drive Thru line, compared to others.  With kids, we decided to take our chance to sit down and enjoy our meal.  We sat at the next available booth while we waited for our order.  One of their employees came over to clean the table and then asked for our Order #.  She said she'd make sure our food was brought out to us.  She asked the tables around us the same thing.  When our meal was ready it was brought to our table.  No other In N Out has done this but it was really nice.   It kept the kids from getting up from the table when the adults usually get up to pick up the food.  The restaurant was clean.  Food was delicious.  The staff was working together to keep it that way.  I'd definitely go back to this location.   There were a lot of college students dining there... small groups and couples."}
{"text":"Always fast, friendly and efficient service at this location. It stays very busy here because of its proximity to the 202 Freeway and ASU."}
{"text":"Nothing else that you can say about In N Out that hasn't been said. It's all true. The burgers are so freakin' good. Don't be shy, try animal style and hold the pickles!  Just a heads up, this might be the busiest In-N-Out burger I've ever been to. You might want to go to a different location during peak hours to avoid the long line."}
{"text":"The hype is real. The lines are not bad. I ordered double double cheeseburger animal style. Also, I got the French fries. The burger was nice and juicy. It is the best burger that I ever had.  it was like a mouth orgasm. The French fries were just okay. Its kind of pricy, but worth it. I recommend this place to anyone out of town ."}
{"text":"man i always eat in and out and it never fails no matter which one i go too its the same and i always get the 4x4 best hambugers period ."}
{"text":"What can I say about In N Out, other than I am a fan!  This particular location is very busy due to all of the tourists.  Next door they have a little gift shop for souvenirs.  I haven't been inside the souvenir shop so I can't comment.  Tons of people in the drive through but it went relatively fast.  Employees I dealt with were extremely pleasant like all of the locations I have visited.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Everything about their burgers are fresh and crisp. They're vegetarian friendly too! Don't forget to upgrade your fries to animal style--SO GOOD.   I'm pretty generic when it comes to ordering but I always order their cheeseburger combo with fries and a medium drink.   Popular place to be, so don't be alarmed when you see the line. They're efficient and quick with their customer service! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Employees are always so friendly and deal with the chaos so well! Also, animal style fries."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and fries were worth the wait. It was super crowded when I went (Noon on a Sunday) which didn't surprise me as I've heard it to be a popular place. Best fast food chain in the country."}
{"text":"Ok. So I found this place and was quite skeptical. Another freaking burger place? How great can it be?? But you will not be disappointed!   Their burgers taste amazing!! They're shakes are tasty AND cheap ($1.50). I recently moved away from here but I'm really missing it. I would really like to try their monster burger whenever I get around to coming back.   When you get something to go, keep in mind they dont have \"to go\" boxes, so your burger will be in a paper wrapping and thrown in the bag. Same goes for fries. I wish they had a little bit better packaging ideas."}
{"text":"Super service a damper friendly staff. The staff was super friendly and they got all the food correct. The food is always fresh, but I wish they could salt the fries. I love the special sauce or thousand Island that they put on the burgers, and I love the pink lemonade, best lemonade ever. All I have to do now is try the shakes, also need to see why they were putting cheese on the fries. Must be a secret menu, but if it's like the rest of their food then it's going to be great."}
{"text":"Food: 4 Decor: 2 Ambiance: 2 Service: 3 Value: 4  Good, but not as good as Shake Shack. And crazy busy."}
{"text":"The double double is always my go to when I find an In N Out burger since it is so damn reliable, I get extra lettuce (trying to be healthy at In N Out....) The burger is always delicious and made to perfection. It always impresses me that they are consistently busy throughout the day when many other fast food restaurants are yawning their days away. It must be a fun environment to work in."}
{"text":"My favorite In-N-Out location. Great service every single time. Even during their lunch hours and after 5pm when they're packed, they still provide fast service. I consider myself a needy customer when it comes to In-N-Out. I always ask for spread, banana peppers and cheese on my fries. Oh, and I get my burger well done!    Management you've been built a wonderful team! Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Fries sucked but that's okay cus in and out has the best burgers. Literally better than any other burger I've ever had. Service is great like chick filas too."}
{"text":"I guess the East Coast vs. West Coast still rivals on.  I'm just one of many defending the east coast (Shake Shack NYC ALL THE WAY).  But I had to judge In-N-Out burger for myself.  I came here with coworkers on a conference and we got lunch.  I ordered the cheeseburger animal style and fries also animal style.    I tried the burger and was unimpressed.  The burger patty is so thin compared to the toppings and the bun.  Bread with a side of meat?  Yea, pretty much.  The grilled onions really added flavor to the burger though.    The fries were so heavy.  Thick cheese and sauce and onions.  Again, the onions made it better until the cheese congealed and was really goopy.  The service was fast and they were really nice.  This was also a lot cheaper than I thought.  Still, I'd gladly pay a premium to eat at Shake Shack NYC!"}
{"text":"My brother ordered animal fries , and the cashier messed up , we didnt get the fries and she was completely rude to my mother when she told her we didnt get the animal fries like it was my mothers fault . never ever should an employee disrespect a customer . i honestly hate this location because of their poor customer service , this was my first worst experience at an in n out and i hope to not come across another ."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick cheeseburger. I have never been before and I was pleasantly surprised.  The cheeseburger was excellent, crispy bun, crunchy edges on the burger, and very fresh. The fries were good and the price was excellent. I will definitely stop by here again."}
{"text":"In N Out tastes like every other fast food joint. Bland thin burger, bland thin fries, bland thick shakes with a high loogie factor. I couldn't even finish my chocolate shake (blasphemy!!!!), it was just so... boring. It tasted more vanilla than chocolate. I don't find the secret menu all that exciting.... it's pretty much just a bigger stack of stuff they've already got on the menu. So what? Fast food is gross.   And yet... all these 5 star reviews. Perhaps there's some kind of hormone that In N Out puts in their food, cooked up in a diabolical Christian laboratory, that affects 99.9% of the population. And somehow I am immune. To quote a great man, the designer of the piano-key necktie: \"Doesn't anybody notice this? I FEEL LIKE I'M TAKING CRAZY PILLS!!\""}
{"text":"Since this is a very popular spot with friends, I decided I would give it a try. I was disappointed. I really didn't think my burger was anything special and the fries were ok. But one thing I did like with the customer service. Everyone was very polite, very friendly, and went out of their way to make sure that I have everything I needed. I do appreciate excellent customer service.  After hearing many people rave about it again, I thought I would give them another try to see if it was just me. So I went again and had the same experience. Blah. Unfortunately, the food was not enough to make me want to come back a third time."}
{"text":"1st time at In-N-Out Burger. Love this place. One of the best burgers I have ever had. We do not have this chain in the Midwest that I'm aware of. This place was crazy busy with a line out the door and the parking lot was jammed. My buddy and I took at cab from the Mirage, which only cost a few bucks. Kind of hard to get a cab out of this place, but we managed. Well worth the stop. I will make this In-N-Out one of the first stops when I get back to Vegas next Feb."}
{"text":"Fast food...perfected.  It's almost always hoppin', but they make your food fresh and get it to you pretty quick.  The staff is always nice, and I almost never see a dirty table or floor."}
{"text":"This place is way overrated and we waited forever to get our food! waited in line at least 15 minutes before my order was taken and after I placed it waited at least 10 minutes more before we got our food! The burgers are delicious and fresh. However they put an entire slice of onion on my burger which ruined the taste and over powered everything else. Also did not put enough of their secret sauce on the bun and their french fries are godawful!  they have hardly any taste at all and are not seasoned with anything. Most of the fries were white in color when they should be a golden yellow maybe because they were not cooked enough but either way they were terrible. Strawberry milkshake tasted great but it was too thick to go up the straw I would take Red Robin over this place any day and get a lot more food, much better tasting fries and much faster service for about the same price!!!"}
{"text":"Idiot kid at the cashier got our order all jacked up. Really, go back to grade school."}
{"text":"I've heard so much a out in-n-out that we had to try it. This location near the Linq is super crowded and it took a while after we ordered to find a seat. Somehow our internet and phones were totally blocked while we ate here. Food was hot and decent. It was not the best burger ever."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of In-N-Out, but at this location I had a HORRIBLE experience. I ordered my food to go with some friends and when I took a bite of my double double I saw that there was MOLD on the bottom of my bun. I was so disgusted I could not eat for the rest of the day. The other people in my group had nothing wrong with their food, so I was the unlucky one. I contacted corporate about the issue and they sent me vouchers for two free meals during my next visit at any In-N-Out but I do not plan on going back for a while..."}
{"text":"Well! Here I am again rating a restaurant chain, but I have good reason! I have things to tell you! Many magical great things!  1. This is the closest In and Out to the Strip (Bellagio, Monte Carlo, New York New York, Paris, etc). It is a reasonable walking distance and gives you a fantastic reason to order 2 double doubles animal style instead of just 1.   Ok, maybe it was just that one thing...  All in all, everything that you would expect from an In and Out. Fairly clean, and quick service. Burgers were extremely tasty as usual and they have indoor and outdoor seating. And if you get tired after eating and don't want to walk back, they often have taxis waiting outside to take you back to your hotel!"}
{"text":"always good - the perfect junk food fix that really tastes good...my guilty pleasure  the team here is consistently efficient & friendly"}
{"text":"Always serving fresh food, Fast service and exceptional  customer service. Limited menu but that's what makes them stand out!  :) thank you In and Out! love your home made fries and the way you serve your burgers for the car ride! :)"}
{"text":"Great place for a  great  price  for a good. Burger i'm in coming to in and out for a long time since I was a little kid with my grandpa and grandma. I know in my heart that in and out is the best place to go because you get what you pay for and you left the cup up and there's always a peaceful message from God in the name of Jesus in and out is a perry proud member of my family and they're awesome"}
{"text":"this place is wierd.  i cliped a coupan from my paper that was for a free large chili with purchis of an drink. when i showed it to the maneger he told me they were \" out of \" stock.  now im not one to get angery over in competince, but this one drived me to the brink.  the manager said \" hey garry. we do have plenty of handburgers made just the way you order it. can i intrist you in one of those?\" i said \" yes\" and then he said \"hear you go. here is your handburger\"  i will say this was a really good handburger and almost made up for the fact that they didnt have my chili. 5 stars"}
{"text":"pros: - consistently great-tasting, high-quality burgers - fast service  cons: - thin patties - limited vegetarian options  yummy meat, delicious fries, thick milkshakes--they deliver on everything in-n-out is known for. you can make small modifications to your meal such as getting cheese or cheese + thousand island dressing on your fries, and you can get a double-double burger that has two beef patties and two slices of cheese. if you are feeling especially hungry, you can get a three-by-three (three patties and three slices of cheese) or a 4x4 (four patties...you get the idea). vegetarians can get a grilled cheese, which is exactly like a classic cheeseburger minus the meat patty. if you like shakes, they have chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, and a mix of the three (called neapolitan) as flavors. don't expect them to have anything but burgers as the main course, though--in-n-out has nearly perfected one thing and one thing only."}
{"text":"We meet again, In-N-Out! Ever since moving to the east coast, I almost forgot how good the burgers and fries were!  I came here a couple of times when I visited Las Vegas recently. The night when my friends and I flew in, we made our first stop at In-N-Out before we even went to our hotel. It was around 12 something and it was still packed with people! I typically get the hamburger--animal style, fries, and a drink. You can never go wrong with In-N-Out. They are always consistent.   I can't wait until I go back to California and get In-N-Out again!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, service, and people! Their fries are a bit on the dry side, and it's usually packed."}
{"text":"I love cheeseburgers, anyone that knows me knows this.  In N Out Burger is hands down the best cheeseburger I had ever eaten in my life. When we went to Vegas 2 years ago, I had my first In N Out Burger. We went to L.A. last summer, we got off the plane, got our luggage, got the rental car and proceeded directly to In N Out Burger @ The 405 and Inglewood Avenue.   They can make a burger as big as a 4x4, I got the 3x3 myself with well done cheese fries. The fries are decent, I know a lot of people don't care for them, but the burgers are the best you will ever have.   The location in this review is nice and convenient, its a short walk from New York New York right down Tropicana Ave under I-15. They also have a company store, which we bought some mugs and T-shirts at after lunch.  I always recommend In N Out to friends going to Vegas or Cali.  You're only going to find them in Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah, that's the only drawback since they are not franchised.  I wish they'd franchise and open up in the Chicago area, they'd kill out here."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love in and out? Animal style is a must! Long line but expected, it goes quick anyways so don't let that discourage you."}
{"text":"There is always a line here and clogs access on the main road and careless drivers just block the road trying to get in here... but onto the food the fries are basically wood sticks with salt on them, and the cheese burgers taste like they have 5 slices of American cheeses. The redeeming one star is the milkshakes."}
{"text":"From 3/2/15  After all these years of wondering what these burgers taste like all the way from the East coast, I finally get one in my mouth #crawlinmybelly !!   We walk in, and the place was packed, I guess that's to be expected for all the hype this fast food joint has known for in all it's glory. I got a cheeseburger animal style with a side of fries; my boyfriend got two for himself because he's greedy.   So was I satisfied you ask? Si, I loved the burgers. I can't say it was everything I hyped it up to be in my mind, but at least it wasn't anti-climatic.   As far as the atmosphere it was a typical fast food sort of deal, nothing special, and the service was par for the course. No real complaints, I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is the best location there is! Obviously In and Out has great burgers and fries that keeps us coming back. That being said, the staff here are the most courteous and devoted group of young adults that I have ever met. Our drive through order was taken at the car with such ease. Quick and friendly service. We were given paper lap mats to keep clean and the burgers looked perfect and amazing. It amazes me that these burgers always actually look pretty. Never any wilted lettuce or mushy tomatoes. Of course delicious! The best employees here!"}
{"text":"Being my first time experiencing this west coast specialty, I had my reservations going in despite the high recommendation from a friend. A nostalgic throwback to an old school drive thru, I was pleasantly surprised by the menu. No choice paralysis here. Not very many items to choose from which for me echoes confidence in products offered. Fresh cut fries and a pretty good burger. Overall I'd return."}
{"text":"Love these burger & fries!  But this place was so dirty! I was surprised to see the mess on the floors. I wish this place was cleaner. They were really friendly and helpful! Someone needs to come here tho and seriously clean this place!"}
{"text":"GREAT choice for something fast for lunch that doesn't tote a \"Vegas Price.\"  It's pretty simple, burger with cheese or without, fries or not and drinks or a few milkshakes (they aren't great, standard fastfood shake mix).  The burgers were pretty dang skippy."}
{"text":"Pros and Cons: the service was well, she took her time with me even though there was a long line. The burgers were tasteless the fries were awful, I love the grilled onions."}
{"text":"This in & out is always busy! The food is always fresh and very good! Fast service and the employees are friendly and nice! In & out keeps it simple with burgers, fries, shakes and sodas and they do it right!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out certainly lived up to the hype. I went here almost everyday for my lunch break and during the month I lived in AZ, I didn't get sick of it. Sometimes the wait was a bit, but with the amount of customers they have, they are entirely effecient. Will there ever be any expansion to the midwest?"}
{"text":"Of course ;) best burger in town, cooked to order - seats available - free refills and fresh lemon for my iced tea. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, some of the best - but get ready to WAIT! The staff moves as fast as possible but fast food isn't really the idea here - it's much more about quality hence huge lines of people. Riding that fine line between greasy and unhealthy with fresh and semi quick. I normally get the double double with extra lettuce and fries animal style. It's a good deal under 10 bucks and somewhat healthy..."}
{"text":"good burger joint, always packed, simple menu, cheap price, the menu is simple, burger, fries drink or chesse burger, fries and drink or double burger, fries and a drink (cheese optional) btw....an item not on the menu is (order your burger \"animal style\"----and it comes with extra toppings including fried onions) you have to know about the animal style or else its not advertised....."}
{"text":"Ok. I'm a little bummed out. After hearing about In-N-Out all this time, I was expecting something out of this world. Like Wham-o! Pow! Kazaaaam! I'm not saying the burger was bad. It was pretty good, but not the best. (I am a fan thought) I had the 3 By 3 Animal Style ---- it's huge, cheap, and 3 notches above most of the chain places. I would definitely visit again when I am out in the west coast."}
{"text":"Consistently awesome. Best burger and fries in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Not really a fan of fast food but I like their fries and milkshakes. Also love that they are open late. I come here when Five Guys is closed. Lines are usually long but they move fast. Service is nice. I've never had them mess up on my order."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is? seems like all my friends love this place.. my wife and I have tried it twice in 2 different states and still not impressed... stale flavorless fries and a very basic plane burger."}
{"text":"I didn't realize this location existed until a couple days ago! I've been going to the one on Trop and the 15 or the one on Blue Diamond thinking those were the closest. Little did I know there was one a couple miles from my house. In-N-Out, without a doubt, has the best fast food burger around. Seriously, a cheeseburger \"animal style\" can't be beat. Any burger and fast food chain that's good enough for Thomas Keller (http://www.foodandwine.com/articles/thomas-keller and http://fastfood.freedomblogging.com/2009/12/20/thomas-keller-in-n-out-inspires-mcdonalds-a-treat-as-a-kid/45993/) is good enough for me."}
{"text":"One bite of their burger and you can taste the freshness of the beef, vegetables, sauce, and seasoning. They cut the fries fresh and throw it straight into the fryer. Freshness is the main theme here.   Aside from their great burgers, shakes, and fries, they have a lot of options that are not on their menu. That's what makes them intriguing. If you're a first timer, talk to any regular that's there. They will tell you things like \"animal style\", 4x4, and hot peppers. Just other day, I learned you can get a neopolitan milkshake! Awesome!  Their menu basically hasn't changed since the first ever restaurant opened up. That's why I love it. Whenever I go get drive thru for a certain number of people, it's pretty easy to remember what everybody wants.  Keep in mind that since everything is fresh and made to order, sometimes it takes a little longer for your order to come out, especially if the place is packed."}
{"text":"Wow...grease and filth!  This place (like all the others) gives new meaning to \"gut burger\".  Flavorless crap heaped on a bun with cold fries to fill in any void remaining.  Once was once too often."}
{"text":"So, how do you mess up an order twice!!?? ...the past TWO times, they got my burger wrong... Double-Double(number 1), no cheese, no onion, extra lettuce, mustard instead(with an iced tea)... Yet, I get a Double-Double, sandwhich only, made normally... 2nd time was this evening(6'oclockish) & 1st, Halloween Night, last Friday... Even after I specially ordered as a meal as well, it gets understood as just a single sandwhich... this is why you don't have your order taker MULTITASKING at the drive-thru!! I'm never going to this location again!! Very disappointed. When I tried to explain how sometimes the ordering gets confusing to the girl in the window, she just looked at me like I was speaking French. Then insisted that it was MY wording, yet I ordered straight off the menu as it reads. Either way, in addition to pickles not being on their burgers, they also have an insane and insufficient ordering process in their drive-thru. When you order the 'combo' it gets understood as just an a la carte. Vise versa when it actually is. UGH the humanity!!!! Yes. Never again. So sorry."}
{"text":"Simple and short review- if you have never been to In-N-Out Burger, go for the experience. It's worth it. Maybe it won't blow you away, but it's a good burger. We went to a couple near San Diego and this was our first experience outside of Cali. The food was delish- my boyfriend always gets the double cheeseburger. Service was very efficient and quick here and the restaurant itself was very clean. Overall- great experience!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. From Samantha in the drive thru as well as the manager. I was overcharged and when I asked about it the worker gave me an attitude and threw my change at me. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Who doesnt love an in-Out-Burger when your bored or hungry late night and nothing else is open?? High Protein High Fat meal. Very good if your in your bulking stage of the year. Always friendly customer service and food is cooked in a timely manner thank you for the great meat!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love In-n-Out?? The menu is pretty simple which I love. Fresh cut fries,  made to order burgers and thick shakes...so good!! Employees are friendly and fast. The one thing I like about eating here is that you don't get that guilty feeling like you do with other fast food chains. During peak hours, it can get packed and the wait times are a little longer. My go-to order is a burger animal style with raw onions instead grilled, fries with a bunch of spread and a ton of banana peppers. My tummy is happy with every visit:)"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said about In-n-Out?   Burgers are delish. Fries are hot and fresh. And shakes are thick and tasty. Their menu is pretty simple; it's just burgers, fries and drinks. And they also have the not-so-secret \"secret\" menu. My go to order is a 3x1 (3 patties, one cheese) animal style (patty cooked in mustard) with raw onions instead of grilled and no tomato. No matter where I go, I know quality will be the same.   What stands out at this location is the customer service. They are always fast, friendly and efficient. During one of my visits, I was standing near the counter waiting for my to-go order and this angry customer stormed up to the counter. He claimed that his burger was raw and showed the female employee the half eaten burger. I saw the burger and I assure you it was not raw. The female employee was very friendly and patient with the irate customer and gave him a new burger even though he proceeded to eat the old one he was complaining about. Some people are just a**holes, but the female employee took it in stride and kept smiling. Props to her. Also, their drive thru goes by pretty quickly even with the long line of cars.   I always pass this location on the way to my parents' house, so I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been to more that one branch of In-N-Out in the valley so far and this branch was just as good as all the other ones, only better for me personally. Having been to the Scottsdale road one and another around south Mesa, this was by far the cleanest and fastest. Overall, I like In-N-Out burgers. 4 stars only because I believe there are better quality burgers out there who really deserve 5*. I like the fact that their fries are actually made from fresh potatoes. I also like the idea of the secret menu, interesting concept. I will definitely be going again particularly because their prices are pretty good for the quality of their burgers and their service is pretty fast."}
{"text":"This is a MUST stop for me every time I'm out here for work. And by must stop, I mean I'll have my cabbie take me there right after the airport, I pick up my Double Double, animal style, naturally, with a side of fries and I'm on my merry way. Open this up in a meeting and I'm in my happy place.   I don't know what it is...a burger is a burger is a burger...but nothing else on the strip or NY's Shake Shack can beat my love for INO."}
{"text":"The best thing about in n out burger is that no matter where you eat at; California, Arizona, Nevada or Texas the food always tastes the same.Got to love a restaurant that sticks to its core product. The service was fantastic, burgers were hot delicious and it wasn't as crowded as the one near the strip."}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally review something that basically everyone has tried, but I just wanted to bring awareness to the fact that there is now an In-N-Out walking distance from the strip! It is located in the Linq promenade, and great if you need something quick and familiar without having to visit a food court. It gets packed and it may be difficult to find a seat, so keep that in mind or take it to go. The food is on par as always!"}
{"text":"This review is a shout-out to Danny. He was one of the most intuitive and polite employees I've interacted with at any business the past two weeks.  Danny, don't change, inspire others and do great things!"}
{"text":"Pretry good  Not the best in n out I've had, but also not dry. Definitely pretry good  One of the guys came by while eating and asked if everything was good and if we wanted a refill on our soda   Great staff"}
{"text":"Fast service, good food.  Love it.  No complaints.  The milkshakes are good too.  We went multiple times during our visit.  Would certainly go back again."}
{"text":"The food was great especially for the price I paid. The wait time to order can take anywhere from 5-10 minutes. Once your order is placed, you would have to find a seat...well if you're lucky to find one. There's seating but this location is always crowded. Not to mention, if you're trying to get to the rest room you'll get shoved because the ordering line blocks the rest rooms."}
{"text":"Honestly I haven't had anything negative to say about any in n outs in my life I LOVE THEIR FOOOOD & customer service is always excellent but this location in particular is worthy of a review.  Long line almost wanted to go to another food spot but I realized how fast the line was moving,  took 5 minutes to get through maybe 12 cars! Impressive and delicious as always."}
{"text":"I make it a point to go to the In-n-out burger everytime I go west ,I love the double double with fries it's so good its hard to believe it's fast food ,expect to wait a few minuets during lunch time it dose get busy but totaly worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I don't like fast food hamburgers. In fact, I am not a big burger fan in the slightest. If I'm going to have cow I want a steak. However, my boyfriend has once told me, \"I could eat a burger for every meal.\" So the first time I ever had In-N-Out was when I first started dating him. He was simply amazed that I had never had one and that he had to fix that.   Nonetheless, I was not impressed the first time we went. And technically still not \"impressed.\" Their burgers are good. If they were a movie I would give them a solid one thumb up. I keep going because the burgers are good. Cheaper than a burger at a sit down restaurant, more convenient and better than the average fast food chain.  I foresee many more trips."}
{"text":"I am so happy that an In N Out Burger is now on the strip. During my previous Vegas trips, I would cab out to the In N Out. Yeah, I'm dating myself here because there was no Uber back then.  This is solid. I love this place. You can even get only a piece of lettuce and a tomato slice alone (no meat, sauce, pickles, onion or bun) if you want to feel like you are dieting. I don't know if that has a secret menu name, but they'll do it for you and it made the fries I ate with it ok to eat after all  In N Out is so good. I love this place and am happy to say that it is of the same great quality as the ones in California. Yay!  Check out the little merchandise store outside and pick up a t-shirt or keychain just for fun!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at an In-N-Out food chain, and I felt that the food was good. But the service that I receive was pretty awesome. It's definitely worth trying again."}
{"text":"Yum. In-N-Out. Simple burgers done right! What I like most is that the buns are toasted and has no sesame seeds, the grilled onions option, and that you can get it protein style if you want a low carb option. I also like that you can ask for them to add chopped chiles if want to add some spice to your burger!"}
{"text":"Fast cheap and delicious!!! We loved it! Staff were perfect and all condiments were stocked. Definitely happy finding out what all the talk was about."}
{"text":"Best, best, best, best. That's all I can say! Super speedy service when we went in, even though it's so busy - they are on POINT. Great prices, great food, quick and easy - I love In-N-Out and I love how they seem to assign someone to the dining room so it's always being cleaned up since the turnover is so high. SUPER YUM feed me style, thank you - oh yeah and order animal fries .. just order them!!"}
{"text":"First time to an in & out, decor on the inside was very cool as it reminded me of an old fashioned diner. Menu was very small which I thought was unique as well. When I got my food it looked absolutely delicious, but when you bite in to the burger, there is no flavor there to savor. The burger was very bland even with all the toppings that come on it. It was very disappointing. The fries were the same way and I understand they are fried in cholesterol free oil, but when you bite in to them there was no crisp about them, they were soft and chewy. Very cool decor and great service, but the food was very underwhelming. First and last time to an in & out."}
{"text":"I can still remember when I had my first In-n-out burger. It was the summer of 2001. One bite and I was hooked. Unfortunately I was only visiting and there is no such thing as an In-n-out burger where I live. So imagine my excitement when I saw this one in Vegas.   There was a wait (as usual) but it moved swiftly which my hungry tummy truly appreciated!  It truly did not disappoint. My burger was so fresh and juicy! I do have to take off one star only because I just don't like the fries. I'm not quite sure. They just taste funny to me. I think it's because my body is programmed to like frozen fries! lol"}
{"text":"I don't understand all the hoopla about this place.  The last time I ate here was probably 2005.  The burger and fries were average but I wouldn't say spectacular.  The prices are reasonable and the staff are nice but when I want to enjoy a great, fresh and non-microwave hamburger I always hit up Whataburger.  To each there own I guess :-)"}
{"text":"Inn & Out Burger is okay.   I don't understand the hoopla about this place other than they are an icon in California and there are alot of Californians living in Phoenix.  Don't get me wrong the food is not horrible it just didn't make me feel like oh my God I gotta have Inn & Out Burger. Since they arrived in Phoenix I have eaten there 2-3 times and it was decent.  I feel the best burgers and fries are at Lenny's and that's where I go when I want to enjoy a delicious burger and fries.  Otherwise, for burgers on the go I will take a Big Mac, Whopper or a Whataburger anytime over Inn & Out but if somebody wanted to go to Inn & Out like say a co-worker for lunch I wouldn't say no because I do love me a hamburger and fries. It's America after all."}
{"text":"Burgers have zero seasoning; their special sauce is 1,000 island; the fries are never cooked properly (either under or over cooked) and those also have no seasoning.  Everything was really greasy - soaked through a stack of napkins :-( I don't understand the big fuss about this place! The secret menu isn't anything special... It's all hype to make people curious. I'll only give their milkshakes 4 stars, those are legit and completely worth the bellyache."}
{"text":"Great food, typical speed of In-n-out, even though it was empty they were a little slow. Great service and clean restaurant, though bathroom smelled funky... Awesome food as always"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers!! Waited for a bit longer since we ordered almost everything 'animal style', toasted buns and well-done fries. Definitely worth it though. Cashier was very friendly and patient even when we were indecisive.  Not as busy as we thought it'd be. The line was not consistently long, food was quick and all the condiments were refilled when they were low.   Great place!!"}
{"text":"One of the better burgers I have had from a fast food place. The veggies are always fresh and I love the \"special sauce\" aka thousand island. Just an all around good burger. Their fries are also great too. Made fresh and perfectly seasoned. The only thing I wish is that their burger patties were a little thicker..."}
{"text":"Amazing. Double double with cheese, no onion, extra pickle!!!  Nothing like it in Chicago...although 5 guys comes close (I guess).  But this place is cheap, GOOD, and fresh!!!!!!"}
{"text":"In-n-Out. If you don't know about it, get your head out of your a** and get a double double, animal style with fries and a shake.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"Fast, tasty and consistent.  I would give them 5 stars, but it wasn't the cleanest location I've ever visited."}
{"text":"In N' Out business model has no flaws. Simple, clearcut menu. Burgers are always freshly-cooked, and the lettuce-tomato-onion always crisp edges. Most quick burger places have the soggy tomato problem, not here.  Employees wear these oversized hats, straight out of Pizza Planet from Toy Story. Speed is a priority, but always have my order right. Food comes in little red lunch trays. Burgers are served with the wrapper support, facing upward. Food presentation checks every box.   This location is newer, and probably the largest In N' Out that I've seen. They're running through people here. Ticket numbers cycle 1-100 throughout the day. I was order #17. By the time I finished my meal, they were on order #94. Talk about speedy gonzalez! Mind..blown !   ANIMAL style is my favorite aspect of In N' Out, which is the Golden Goose of the franchise. Although not featured on the menu, Animal orders smear a blend of sautéed onions and thousand island sauce, to my knowledge. Anything you order can be served animal style.   Milkshakes are mediocre average, but they also don't claim them as a focal point. --PASS--  ***Affordable, quick, delicious. You really do come in, then out. HUGE IMPACT. My only complaint is the lack of locations around the country. Consistent end product, start to finish***"}
{"text":"This place is packed. I've been here a few times now, and the only downside to this place is that it's sometimes tough to get a ride back to the hotel you're staying at (assuming you took a cab to get a burger). One alternative is to run across the street to Wild Wild West, but that's definitely hit-or-miss.  As for the food, if you've had In-N-Out anywhere, then you'll know it's terrific (though while its similar to NYC's Shake Shack, its just  a bit different/not as good). Lines here can get pretty long, but overall, the wait's not too long, and you are usually able to find a seat either inside or outside."}
{"text":"I have had In-N-Out Burger in Los Angeles.  This is a poor representation of the restaurant.  Buns were dry French fries WAY salty and I was soooo upset. All we talked about before our trip was that we were going to eat at in n out burger."}
{"text":"Every ingredient is fresh and made to order. Probably one of favorite places to get a chocolate shake."}
{"text":"Easy breezy to get to, on and off the highway.   We had no wait at dinner time at the cash register (we went here twice on our way to and from LA)  and got our food in about 10 minutes.   Really affordable for excellent food, and kid friendly.    LOVE the double double with grilled onions, fries, and a chocolate shake!    All of the staff was super friendly and nice.  When my daughter flipped her fries on the ground, they were really nice about cleaning it up, and brought her some new ones.  They also gave the kids stickers and a puzzle for while we were waiting for the food.   Will definitley go to this one again when we are road tripping this way!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that hasn't been said already? Probably nothing...  or maybe that if you are a vegetarian you can still eat here. YAY!  Get the grilled cheese animal style, you won't regret it!  If you're a meat eater get a burger animal style.   DO IT!  The end"}
{"text":"In-n-Out never fails to deliver, no matter what location you choose.  The staff here are cheerfully devoted to their craft, and the food is spot-on.  Every so often they will get an order wrong, but it generally gets corrected before it gets across the counter or all the way through the drive-through window."}
{"text":"N-o-M, N-o-M, N-o-M, N-o-M! Being from Chicago this was my first In-N-Out (Burger)! Aww, they were so nice to our big group of clueless Inny Outty virgins, big props!  And the burgers (Double Double, natch) and fries were tasty! Mere steps from the UNLV campus, they keep the dining area clean and the line moving! Thanks for being my first, I'll never forget you!"}
{"text":"This is a tourist thing which is an acquired taste...unfortunately I have not acquired a taste yet for bad food.  I went there because the wife loves this place for some reason so why not.  My 3rd time at In-N-Out and I still don't like it.  To me it taste like frozen meat patties grilled and toss it on a toasted bun....absolutely tasteless.  How this place get so many folks I have no idea but this is not a burger, H&F in Atlanta makes the best burger IMO.  I rather eat McDonalds then this place....and Wendy's is definitely better then this cardboard of a burger.  Sorry but I have nothing nice to say about this place. 2 stars because the service is pretty good, that is it."}
{"text":"Just brought burgers and fries from 'in and out' at 95 and Lake mead. They increased the price and the fries are very bad. I don't know how to post picture here but all the fries are broken, brown and dark brown and 1 to 2 inches in size."}
{"text":"As a native East Coaster, for YEARS, I have heard about the myth & the mystery surrounding In & Out Burger. I've been to California multiple times; it eludes me why I never made it to In & Out Burger then. Then recently, I was visiting my brother in Las Vegas when I saw the In & Out Burger sign. For some reason, I assumed it was a California thing, as opposed to a West Coast thing. Easy decision. I had the Double Double. I'm a fan, no doubt. Certainly one of the Top 5 burgers I've had ever. Everything about it is right: it's simple, it's juice, the beef really stands out. With things like heart disease, it's a good thing I don't live on the West Coast!"}
{"text":"Woo wee! What a walk! 90 degree weather at 11am! Walk from Harrahs all the way to this In n Out. Dodging traffic like bruce lee. Finally after about 30 mins of walking we made it. It had been a while since i tried me some in n out. My buddie was more excited. I came along for the walk. Walk in the place was pack as usual. Ordered me a double double combo  sat outside because that was the only seat left. Burger was good but not great! The meat seem a lil cold. I'm guessing they cook a bunch of patties and leave them there since it was so busy. Anyways it was good. Maybe after walking 30 mins made the meal better. Well had my in n out fix for the year. Go to Orleans hotel and try Fuddrucker. Now thats a burger. A combo will cost about 5 bucks more though"}
{"text":"I live in Chicago and often have cravings of an In-N-Out cheeseburger and fries......    loooooovvvveeeeee In-N-Out and miss it very much :-( please put one in the midwest In-N-Out!!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out is a solid burger joint that's worth going to if you're ever in the area.  The wife and I both had burgers with french fries. To be honest, I don't like the shoestring fries, which seem to go stale in a hurry and are a bit dense for my liking. But it's okay, because the burgers, with mustard and/or a special thousand-island style dressing more than make up for it.  The beef tastes fresh, and it's seasoned lightly. And I think the buns have a light coating of butter or oil, and they're wonderfully soft to boot.  There were a ton of people here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon, so you might have to take your food outside."}
{"text":"Like everyone else I agree the food is great. It is an institution.  We visit this location every time we are in Vegas to see my parents. Cheeseburger animal style with a milk shake, game over!  The burgers are great, a top 5 burger. The shakes are dense and so F'ing good.  But, I think the fries are lacking.  This may be an East vs. West thing but I just think the fries are thin, weak, and flimsy. Yes, you can get them well done but it does not help.  I am happy to enjoy my meal there without the fries. I would rather go over to Five Guys and get a giant bag from there. Their burgers are tasty too... This is still a solid meal and can't miss. Give me my In N Out hat and dive in!"}
{"text":"Tucker Max says it best:    \"I have only fallen in love three times in my life, and the first bite of that Double-Double was one of those times. The crispy bun complimenting the cool lettuce, the special sauce accentuating the fresh tomato, the sweet meat mixing with the salty cheese, all of it coming together in a harmonious medley of flavor thus far unseen on the American fast food landscape - I was smitten. It was the single greatest fast food meal in the history of civilization. Even though I was full, I immediately ate another Double-Double. I was nearly in tears at this meal, it was so transcendently excellent. Those #*&!@'s should hire me as a spokesman.\"  TIP: Do not allow your Cabbie to keep the meter running.  Yes.  My friend and I left the Ditch Fridays pool party at the Palms to go get our second, yes second, Double Double for the day.  We took a cab to the In N Out Burger.  It was an adventure I will never forget and good god are those burgers delicious."}
{"text":"Food was great as usual it's what you come to expect from an In N Out. The major problem with this location as mentioned by some other reviewers is the fact that the night shift is a skeleton crew. This causes super long wait times. The location also isn't too great so you really do wanna get in n out!"}
{"text":"Lickety split went the line :) the greeter asked me how I was doing and I said i'll be doing great in about five minutes! LOL it took them 4 and I had my burger and drink. Great service, smiling employees, super fast and super yum!! Thank you In-n-Out!"}
{"text":"Always good! Never messed up an order. however, if you are in a time crunch, ALWAYS go through the drive through. So much slower inside."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger. You can't go wrong with in n out burger. Great quality, very tasty at a great price. Everything is fresh and never frozen. Great customer service and very clean establishment."}
{"text":"My friends and I came to this location last night but noticed our burgers weren't fully cooked. It seemed as if the staff was rushing to get them out, but the strangest aspect was, there were not many customers in the restaurant. Displeased as each of our burgers clearly had chunks of red rawness in them. Haven't had this issue with other In-n-Out locations in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We don't have these in Florida, but I went to one while visiting family in Arizona. They are pretty good. Second only to 5 guys in my opinion."}
{"text":"Good food for fast food. Always busy and serves hot, made to order food.  Animal style is the only way to go!"}
{"text":"Whats not to like. Double Beef Animal Style please! As a east coaster I make an effort to make it to any IN and OUT when traveling out west."}
{"text":"I hardly ever go to fast food places to order food, yet alone a burger. But In N Out can make a pretty good burger. So if you're cravin a burger.. fast, In N Out is the way to go.  It has been a long time since I've had In N Out and the burgers are still the same. At this location, things are on the slower side. The drive thru line gets pretty packed.They created a lane for the drive thru using cones and chains. So once you're in that line... theres no way out! And it ALWAYS smells like sewer outside. It just kills my vibe!  I usually get a #2. Cheeseburger no onions, animal style fries no onions. But last visit I decided to be crazy and keep the onions on the fries. Bad idea! My fries tasted like sh**. I have started to acquire the taste for onions but In N Out grilled onions are disgusting! I will stick to \"No onions please\".   They have a secret menu. Part of that is animal style fries. They also have protein burgers, grilled cheese, and some other fun secretive items that I can't remember. My friend once told me they had a item called \"Road Kill\" and she ordered it in California and it is basically Animal Style fries with chopped up burger patty on top. I tried ordering it here and they had no idea what I was talking about. ¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"Wowowowowow! I am NOT a burger eater at all (the last burger that I had was probably 10 years ago), but after knowing about this place, I convinced my husband to go there to get a burger so I could have a bite. He got his double double, and I asked for a bite. Burger bliss. Everything a burger should be. Fresh, juicy, cheesy, and just perfect. Fries were crispy and delicious, too. I'd definitely eat a whole one next time I come out to Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a quick bite to eat on our first day in Vegas to compensate for not eating breakfast, lunch and having too much to drink on a empty stomach. Although the line was long we got through it pretty fast to place an order and even had a little time to have a small conversation with our cashier who asked us a question about our Fat Tuesday in our hands and how she never had one before.  Our number was in the latter part of the 40's and they were on their 20's. We waited around for a while to get our order as the 20's passed, 30's passed, 40's passed, 50's passed... wait what? Where is my order? I went up to the pick up counter and waited a little bit before i asked if they called 48 yet?   The lady that helped me checked the back and found my order stashed with all the other upper number of to-go bags. We walked to the Linq to meet up with my friends and ate our meal. The burger weren't even warm (The Linq is literally across the way and the temperature outside was well over 100 degrees). The fries were super cold that we didn't even touch it. This tells me that they totally forgot to call out my order number and was sitting there for a long time for.   I've experienced much better than this location but, on the good side the ordering line goes by really fast."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and wasn't a long wait time when I walked inside, will definitely come back but what definitely made my day was the employee Cole, he was super nice and friendly, had a great big smile. Definitely happy to see someone like him today."}
{"text":"I used to go to the Rock Springs location all the time after high school seven years ago...  This location is perfect for an In-N-Out as there are shopping centers all around.  I love that the workers always double-check my order when I get some custom burgers and fries. The fries are always light and crispy. The burgers are just like any other In-N-Out joint. For a bunch of kids working here, it seems like the service is great! The only issue is going here after school is out during school hours! A bunch of kids being loud and disruptive seems to be common."}
{"text":"The original menu? The secret menu?  It really does not matter because these guys here will go to there utmost ability to get you the burger that you want and how you want it. I remember coming here after high school asking for a \"three patty, no cheese, grilled onions, protein style with French fries, but put some grilled onions on the fries.\"  Complicated, but they seem to know what is going on. I give a lot of credit to these folks for being able to put up with a bunch of high school kids who go to Cimarron High School. I can only imagine the disaster that comes with teenagers, yet the service and friendliness is still to par."}
{"text":"I love ordering a four-patty hamburger, protein style with grilled onions, no cheese and one extra sauce packet!"}
{"text":"Considering it is in Vegas, felt it would be so so, but the quality and friendliness of the staff was great.  Food well prepared, and no issues, even with the amount of people going through.  Clean restrooms, and eating areas. Pleasure to dine at."}
{"text":"Typically, I would shy away from writing a review on a fast food chain with 290 locations. However, the In-N-Out experience is anything but the normal fast food dining experience. I am always impressed by the consistency of the In-N-Out Burger experience.   The quality of their never frozen beef patties and fresh, made-to-order burgers is excellent and their customer service is always prompt, efficient, and wonderful. The staff is always courteous and happy--it's good to know that I am supporting a place that seems to treat their employees well.   The inexpensive burgers and fries always hit the spot--I only wish there were locations outside of California and the Southwest to satisfy my fast food burger cravings. But, I suppose staying within a manageable driving distance of the distribution centers is what keeps the food high-quality, fresh, and preservative-free.  My go-to is the protein style double double burger (no bun, just a hearty lettuce wrap around patties that are oozing with cheesy goodness).  When I want to try a variation on my favorite, I just consult the \"Not-So-Secret\" menu on the In-N-Out website!   If you have not been to an In-N-Out burger, I strongly recommend visiting this wonderful fast food place! Expect a long line and short wait, but if you are a fast food/burger lover, you will not be disappointed!  Fun tidbit: Look for the bible verse references on the paper products. Just noticed this after my umpteenth visit to In-N-Out Burger!"}
{"text":"ooooooo.........grilled cheese animal style. (vegetarian)   awesome!!!     love it love it love it."}
{"text":"New to Vegas and this was my first fastfood burger. It was pretty busy at the drive through, possibly 4 cars ahead of me. Ordering didn't take long. If you order alot, they put your food in a takeout box. We ordered 6 cheeseburger and fries to go. We got home, like 8min away, and the burgers were still warm, and the fries... well, they were gone by the time we got home. LOL. They were good. Fresh and tasteful. Better than McD's. So Im at home and I sit down and get a burger out of the box, surprisingly everything held up nicely. I bite into it, and holy cow... literally... god bless that cow that gave it's life to be on that soft bun. Juicy, beefy, and cooked just right. And that sauce, kind of like a ketchup and italian dressing throwdown. Nicely done In-N-Out... nicely done."}
{"text":"This location sucks. I have grown up on this stuff and for some reason this location gets it all wrong. DD did not taste right, dry! Fries not done right, not enough salt and I ordered it animal style and it was disgusting!   I will never go to this location again. I will stick to the Tempe location as it's as close to home as possible.   Very disappointed. Horrible!"}
{"text":"Lines were crazy, tables were a little dirty, and the food was nothing short of spectacular. Definitely order off the \"secret\" menu!"}
{"text":"Oh memories of my first night in Vegas......  I had an In and out Burger for the first time in Vegas back in 2002.  So I love it because it brings back fond memories of greasy goodness back when I was able to digest greasy goodness.   Even after I had one of their burgers I became an even bigger fan when I read a case study on the In and Out burger business in grad school.  They make ONE main product and they own the entire supply chain. Because of this, they make an exceptionally tasty and fresh hamburger. They are not greedy in trying to increase their profits and compete with other markets (like making chicken sandwiches...) and they keep their location within a reasonable distance of their distribution center to provide fresh burgers.  Awesomeness to the max!  Even if you aren't a supply chain geek like me, you'll still appreciate the fresh and tasty burgers In and out has to offer."}
{"text":"The protein/veggie style burgers are a must have if you are trying to lay off carbs & bread. After every workout I do I go to this location & get veggie style for the win."}
{"text":"This was a treat for me because we don't have In N Out on the east coast. But the burger and fries were so delicious and the staff was so patient and friendly!! Cheaper than Five Guys and healthier! I highly recommend the double patty wrapped in lettuce."}
{"text":"Fast fresh and delicious fast food  First time coming and I enjoy ever piece of my meal. Staff moves very fast. My burger was everything and my cheese fries"}
{"text":"I do not care for hamburgers at all. BUT I LOVE these hamburgers. To be a 110% honest this is the only place I will eat them at. There fresh cut fries are also very good not my favorite but very good. The food is always made to order and very fresh."}
{"text":"Thats right I said it. 5 stars for In n Out Burgers.  As far as I'm concerned,  they can do no wrong. Service with a smile, always a pleasant atmosphere. The burgers, fries and shakes are exceptional. If Jesus was working there I would give them 6 stars."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I only went once, but they have one of the best burgers and french fries I've ever tasted.    The prices are incredible, I don't think I've ever had a burger so cheap.  The beef, french fries-  MM everything is so good here.     Coming from NY where there are tons of great burger places. I know a good burger when I taste one ;)."}
{"text":"Great and fast service. Tons of people here during lunch time but thats not a reason to dock stars. We were fortunate to get seats as a table was leaving. Line was out the door but the food came quickly. Excellent service and delicious food. Highly recommended: get extra \"spread\" packets for burgers and fries (their special sauce)."}
{"text":"You know while I have been to In n Out a gazillion times, this one and a few others, I have never taken the time to review them. I mean if you are looking this up on Yelp you are either confirming the location, store hours, and whatnot, not really checking to see what people are saying about it because I mean come on, you MUST have heard about it before.  What can I say? Its burgers and fries are glorious, and when you order you better get it animal style which basically means they load it with their special sauce they called the spread (and you can ask for as many extra packets of them as you heart desires) - basically a variant thousand island fry sauce type mixture, and grilled onions and cheese. It melts your mouth as it melts your heart. Get it for both your burgers and your fries and get ready to coma happily."}
{"text":"Uh, how could anyone hate In-N-Out? Really. Like, how could anyone possibly have anything bad to say about this place?  Ahem. Anyway. This particular location lives up to the hype. They're always fast (or as fast as possible if there's a line out the door), friendly, and they've never messed up my order (which is double meat, protein style, extra spread - in case you were wondering).   Go to In-N-Out. Like really, just go."}
{"text":"at the first window at 10:22pm I was treated with a shallowest attitude I've had in customer service. it was a girl with gapped teeth. wanted to say screw this and leave and get my money back but there were people ahead"}
{"text":"My favorite fast food joint in Las Vegas! My only gripe is how insanely packed it gets and it can be hard to find seating. Other than that, it is incredible place to get a burger. My mom loves topping her fries with cheese!"}
{"text":"I am truly surprised how okay this place was! I've always imagined my first time at In-N-Out, I would have multiple O's in my mouth but all I got was Oh...  Let's start off with the pros of this place: Everything is made in-house. They literally put the spud in the slicer in front of you! The milkshakes are the creamiest milkshakes I've ever had so this definitely was the highlight of my night!!  Now the cons: The burgers are overly salty. Saltier than I am when I'm trying to get my revenge on the person that cut me in traffic. The fries, although are perfectly made, are not perfectly seasoned. The cheese is bland. The animal style fries are also salty. Maybe we just got a bad batch and someone accidentally poured the entire tub of salt in our order. Maybe west coast folks just don't have that taste bud anymore and anything remotely salty to us southerners are normal to them."}
{"text":"tldr  Like I said in one of my previous posts, this place is my go-to. I messed around and got one protein style hamburger and one hamburger. In my opinion the buns you get on a regular hamburger isn't going to mess up your carb macro too much. The protein style is just more sloppy and just lacking in taste compared to the regular hamburger.  Get: -double double cheeseburger (minus the cheese) and grilled onion"}
{"text":"After getting some booze on the strip this has been my spot. Don't let the line deceive you guys good is served quickly . Tough to find seating so have someone order while you look for a spot for your friends . Double double both kind of onions and fries with a strawberry milk shake please . Hits the spot every time :)"}
{"text":"I like how they keep it simple. If you go through the drive thru, expect your burger a little rare.  Walk in and the burger usually gets a little more time *less rare more well.  I don't waste my time asking them to do this.  I walk in when I care and drive thru when I don't.  My son 11 only likes the grilled cheese *plain with a strawberry shake and the fries that aren't burned.  Kids are picky so I order a burger and eat the rest of the fries.  My only complaint is that they don't sale the grilled cheese sandwich for less.  It's bread and cheese for the same price the cheeseburger."}
{"text":"Truly a great fresh burger. The service was quick and the staff was very friendly. The place was packed but don't fear they can get you in n out in a heartbeat"}
{"text":"Okay In and Out is what it is, not sure myself why people think it's such a big deal.    Here's the rant. Wife and I just went through drive in and before we went off too far checked the order.  Well as expected wife's burger was made wrong. Went inside to get it corrected and they made the whole order over.  Whatever, one would think after going in pissed off ( keep in mind this is not the first time a simple order was not made right) when they handed the new order over it was made right.   Okay so we leave get home and they made the same mistake again  HOW HARD IS IT  TO SIMPLY GET A SINGLE BURGER MADE RIGHT!   Again, I just don't understand why people think these burgers are so good.   This store just needs more supervision and training"}
{"text":"Love the Animal style fries!! Always busy, and I take that as a sign of good food. I always arrive starving so waiting isn't fun, but it's always worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way to visit a friend. Went through the drive-thru. The line was long but moved quickly. Fries were some of the freshest and hottest I've ever had at an In-N-Out. On the flip side, all 4 of us complained about the stale buns on our grilled cheese  burgers. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was a bad day when my friends and I stopped here on the way home from out Vegas trip. It was a Sunday and super crowded, inside and the line for the drive-thru. The young lady taking orders was super friendly. She was so friendly, she began complimenting me on my long, real nails, kept talking, and briefly forgot about taking our orders. Lol!   She was a bit hyper, but I give her 5 stars.   Food was hot and fresh. It gets 5 stars.  As for the young lady at the drive-thru window, she had a very stank attitude and acted like she didn't want her job. Luckily, I was having a good day and didn't feel like complaining."}
{"text":"From the midwest,I really don't see what everyone  is craving for. Maybe if from west coast I could see the attraction. Burger was just ok,be awhile  before we go back.Store could probably  be little  neater."}
{"text":"Crazy long lines but its worth it. I pulled up like a champ and ordered a 3x3 animal style, animal style fries, and a neopolitan shake. That's right folks I went there! The smell of this place alone will fill you up. All of the emploees here smile and make you feel wanted. That's always a plus for me. I think they handled the pressure of the crazy lines well. By the time I pulled up to the window the food was done so there was no unnecessary waiting.  The only thing that I think they could add is some music in the drive thru area. I mean the wait sucked pretty bad so a little old school music while you wait would probably sooth the beast in my belly."}
{"text":"Great place for fast food. It is always clean. All employees are very professional. I never see anyone standing around."}
{"text":"The staff at this location are outstanding, they always go out of there way to be friendly to all there customers. The inside and outside is always clean and neat. The has always been hot, fresh and has always been correct  (special orders) I can not tell you how much I love there spread always getting extra. They have a small menu but they have a excited one that is there secret menu. If you don't know about ask them on your next visit. This review was written on July 22nd but visit was on July 21st...."}
{"text":"Wonderful brunch Vegas style.   Arrived a few moments before 11 to beat the big crowds at this popular burger Mecca.   When I left at 11:20, the line was already out the door...   'Nuff said.   People vote with their feet!   We did a super complex order (my wife does a triple patty protein style with lots of extras), and they got it right - not an easy feat given how off menu we went!"}
{"text":"Oh Dear In-N-Out,  How I love thee! Yet, I fear our long distance relationship will not last. The distance! Me turning away from meat (as much as possible)! And you, well you'll never change (and that's a good thing.)  If you were closer it may work but for now let us depart on a good note and remember the happy times. There will always be a place in my heart (and stomach) for you sweet, sweet In-N-Out.  Love, Naurry  P.S. Can we still be (culinary) fuck buddies for those times I come into town?"}
{"text":"Have heard the hype for years so finally we went into one and know what?  It didn't impress me that much.  The service was pretty speedy, the place was very clean, fountain drinks are fountain drinks and the burgers were pretty good.  Awesome? No.  Good and reasonably priced? Yes!  I didn't like the fries at all.  They weren't crispy they were mushy and rather tasteless but hubs enjoyed his double double that was wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun.  I can now cross this place off my list of places to try and maybe one day I might try them again - maybe."}
{"text":"tldr  Burgers are CRACK and ridiculously cheap. #1 double double burger with fries and a drink for $6.76 out the door. Then a hamburger (you don't need that cheese bro) is $2.38 can't beat that. Animal style is good but you don't need those extra macros.    Get: -meal #1 double double burger (no cheese) with grilled onions  Protip: break off that jalapeño juice in your burger and fries."}
{"text":"What else can I say? It's in-n-out my fav burger joint 100% over anything! Nice and simple menu no fuss! Animal style your burger!! The fries are the best I have ever had! It's the size of McDonald's fries but these are fresh, and Chewy, not the frozen crunchy kind."}
{"text":"Being from the Midwest, In-N-Out has always been just something I dreamed about. I was THRILLED to find out the Vegas has several locations. Throughout my 5 day trip to Vegas, I ate In-N-Out for lunch 3 days. I was addicted after the first bite.  Ask for \"Animal Style\" on either your fries or burger and you will not be disappointed. The service was excellent, food was delicious and fresh, and a combo completely filled me up for a very reasonable price.  100% lived up the hype I've heard"}
{"text":"It's an In-N-Out just like any other, which is good, because they make a great burger and fries.  This place gets really busy but they still hustle through it and get your food out fast.  It can be a minor challenge to find a table during peak times, but just have someone watch for tables while you wait for the food to come out.  We've always had a table open up in time."}
{"text":"For fast food I've gotta say this would be my first choice."}
{"text":"This review is gonna be short and sweet. I love In-N-Out Burger!! This location is the only one I'll eat at because the food always tastes fresh here. Thanks guys for doing such a great job."}
{"text":"Why, at 6:30 at night, dinner time, was there a pile-up of cars two miles long?!?!?! Seriously? It is bad enough that the restaurant is apparently now franchised and the integrity is gone- food is awful compared to that of San Diego and Vegas, but now I have to wait 45min to order a shake?! They should have people outside taking orders, or more help at gee... I don't know, dinner time. What a concept. Stay clear of this grotesque place!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this location and In-N-Out in general. The fries are better at this location than the other one I used to go to. The last couple times I have been here, the girl at the counter has been a little confused by my order. Everything came out right in the end though."}
{"text":"wow, this was a dangerous walk from the strip.  i don't even want to imagine walking here in a vegas stupor of over the top drinking and fun.  the best part of my in-n-out experience was ordering.  i was able to get in my order of:  a #1, animal style burger, light fries and coke and a cheeseburger, animal style, well done fries and a neapolitan shake   in what must have been less than 5 seconds.  even more amazing was the cashier who repeated it all back to me in 3 seconds flat.  awesome-ness.  having had the east coast version of in-n-out (shake shack), i wasn't over the moon about the burger and fries here.  the food was indeed good, and my burger even tasted a bit like a mcdonald's big mac, but my eyes didn't bug out at the first bite of my burger and fries nor did my taste buds shout in excitement.  i did really enjoy my neopolitan shake though.  my next food challenge is to find something like that in ny.  needless to say, we took a cab back to the strip."}
{"text":"Other than the long wait, this is the go to spot. Always good shakes, fries, and burgers. I'm not normally near this side of town but it's good to know anywhere there's an in n out, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I used to hate fast food hamburgers, but i found the one fast food burger that never disappoints! I love this place! when i first came here, I dreaded it since i hate hamburgers, but friends made me try one... to my surprise, I loved it, and now I look forward to going here everytime someone mentions it. hmmm my mouth just watered as I wrote this review. maybe I'll grab a burger for dinner tonight lol. :)"}
{"text":"I love In-n-Out -- this location though, while food quality is on par with all of the In-n-Outs in California is SUPER BUSY. The lines are long, and getting a seat is near impossible unless you vulture a table that looks like it is about to finish. Which also makes for an uncomfortable eating experience when you are eating and other guests are eyeing you for your table. The alternative is to sit outside in the blazing heat. Overall though, if you are craving In-n-Out I'd definitely go -- I just wouldn't bother sitting in."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy!!!! First time at this location.  Great service and quality of food! I love that each location provides the same excellent service."}
{"text":"Do I even have to go there?!?!  the staff is so nice manager came out to see us and made sure we were full. Bought tee shirts and more food. MMMMM LETS EAT"}
{"text":"Fly here just to eat and be treated like royalty? Yes why yes we do!!!! The place is constantly be cleaned and perfected. The employees here are so nice and friendly and helpful, I wish NM would get one and be just like this place. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Awesome as always, this location is particularly nice and very fast.  Love those burgers!"}
{"text":"I've had many of In N Out in my day and this onr is as good as any of them. Everything you'd expect from an In N Out is available and ready at the Surprise location. The service was quick and the place was fairly clean. There is usually a line because of how new this place is. I recommend trying the regular double double first then venture into the \"secret\" menu."}
{"text":"It's In N Out. The standards are pretty much the same in every restaurant unless you go to a California In N Out... but everything seems to taste better in California for some reason.  I like the fresh ingredients and value prices. Can't go wrong with In N Out.... Don't forget about the off menu stuff like animal fries. I personally like to get my onions grilled. Having a huge piece of fresh onion is a bit too much for my taste buds. Grilling it makes it better!  Drive thru at this particular area can get super crowded. It wraps around during peak hours and sometimes even late at night!"}
{"text":"Nothing is worst than being starving, getting home & it's the wrong order. It took 20 mins to get our food in drive-thru because they gave our order to another car. Had to park & wait for them to remake our order. Finally get our food, drive 15 mins home only to find out they gave us a single patty vs. double double. Never experienced this horrible service @ in-n-out before. Although the staff was nice, so disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. I visited Las Vegas and I knew this was a must have so I tried it. I am vegetarian but I decided to cheat this once and try the burger. I was pretty good, I would say 9/10. The fries are amazing! Nice ambiance and the restaurant is very clean. The staff also takes your tray when you are finished. I felt bad letting them do that but I guessed it was to keep the customers moving in-n-out, haha! The staff was also very friendly. I loved the freshness of the toppings on the burger the most. Next time I would probably just get a veggie burger with the toppings and that should be good enough for me. The outside of the restaurant also looks very nice. The price was great too!"}
{"text":"I was told for years that I had to try this place.   What a waste of time.  The burgers are paper thin and overcooked.  The fries were fresh but bland. There are no other choices besides burgers here.  Only the amount of patties you want.  Plus we had to wait about 10 minutes for fast food. I would rather have Five Guys Burgers any day!!"}
{"text":"If you want a fast but good burger that doesn't break the bank, leaving u money for other fun things! Really nice employees too!"}
{"text":"My go to location.  Great fast and friendly spirit.  Employees really seem like they enjoy working here.  Food is consistently fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"If your trying to eat clean and healthy, you must try the protein style with NO sauce. Keeping the sauce defeats the purpose.. IMHO"}
{"text":"Couldn't leave my Yelp review trail without a write-up of In-N-Out - the fine burger establishment - this place is all it needs to be, and you can be assured no matter which one you go to in any state - you will get the same quality food and service at any one.  Double-Double with grilled onions cannot be beat by any burger chain, and few gourmet burger joints.  Fries are simple, fresh and just damn good.  Service is always friendly, they keep the place clean, and staff always seems to be in good spirits and well treated by management/owners.  I have never encountered a simple fast food chain with these types of qualities, In-N-Out has a winning formula."}
{"text":"The food is ok, Service is always slow, but it seems fresh and is always hot! I like the protein style   burgers!"}
{"text":"If you've never had the joy of ordering your fries animal style, you're just not living! They can be a little messy so plan on dining in or waiting till you get home. The burgers are always on par and I recommend adding the extra raw onion. The milkshakes are wonderful, but can be very filling. Beware of the wait time as everything is made when you order it- definitely not a grab and go type!"}
{"text":"Just what I wanted a nice cheeseburger after a long week of working out and watching what I eat. The fries were nice and crunchy. The hamburger was perfect."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this location at all. I mean, it's still In N Out, so the actual food I got was amazing, AS ALWAYS. But, the service at this location kinda falls flat. I got into the drive thru around 4:40pm & noticed that it wasn't that busy- not too many people actually inside the restaurant either. The girl who took my order was really frazzled and confused. I had to repeat my order about 3 times. Then to top that off, I was in the drive thru for 20 minutes- didn't get out til 5pm. Like, what is that?"}
{"text":"My only words are...I love In-N-Out Burger! I wish they would come to New Mexico!! So obviously I recommend coming here :)"}
{"text":"In n out. Good food for the cheap lol. Get the animal fries and the cheeseburger/double double with grilled onion. When they are busy with the drive thru, they have an employee outside to take your Orders so it'll be speed up a little. But they make great burgers! Oh and if you wanna watch your diet, you can get it protein style or you can order a grilled cheese for the vegans. Whenever I come to this in n out they are really fast and polite too."}
{"text":"Not only are the burgers and fries incredibly fresh, the staff here do an excellent job in maintaining the restaurant.  They had people always moving around doing stuff, like cleaning the windows, wiping down surfaces, helping people throw out trash, etc.  It was really busy when we came in, but we just asked to share a table with someone and they were totally cool with it.  We ordered two #2s, but after reading some of these other yelp comments, I think we might have missed out on some of the secret menu stuff."}
{"text":"How can one even be near an In-N-Out and not stop by??!!    I wanted a quick brunch and saw it as I was driving.  Decided to get the off menu 3x3...triple burger with fries and drink.  It did not disappoint!     During every vacation I'll find the closest In-N-Out and make sure to visit. The consistency at all of them are fantastic.   The burgers always juicy and delicious and of course the fresh potato French fries!!  Easily my favorite fries at any hamburger stop!  Many can try to copy such s simply cooked item but never match it!     The 3x3....better than any triple burger you find anywhere!  You'll wish you ordered a 4x4 or two 3x3's!!   Just can't get enough of the burgers here!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location.  We were there primarily for the merchandise that they sold. It's so cool because you think of in-n-out and of the long lines they had so you automatically assume you'll have to wait in a long line even though all you want is the t-shirts. They had a separate  window for the merchandise which was awesome !!! The associate Austin was super helpful and patient with us. There were so many great things to choose from and we also got a complimentary cup for spending I think it was $50."}
{"text":"Mustard-fried double double protein style with grilled onions and animal style fries. A late night run that definitely hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Best and cheapest place to eat in vegas. Don't even need the fries. Just a double burger and you're set to go for under $5!!"}
{"text":"This was everything I ever imagined it would be and more.  Being from the east coast, In-N-Out was always simply an unfulfilled dream, so when we booked our trip to Phoenix, we were beyond excited that there was a location mere seconds away from our resort.   We hadn't even unpacked our bags when we ventured on over, and we are so glad we did!  This particular location has amazing staff and service!   Everyone was kind, knowledgeable, and fun.  Our food was obviously great.  You truly cannot go wrong.  I'm not a fan of fast food whatsoever, but I have made an exception for In-N-Out, and would do so again in a heartbeat.  In fact, I did - two more times while in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Always amazing!  We have all had it. What I love about this location is that it's super fast!  Fastest in n out I have ever had!  Looks like there's at least 30 people working in there. Great food and speedy!"}
{"text":"Never ate at an In & Out, had to see what the fuss was about. Long line, but it went pretty fast, so that's a plus.   I'm sure I'm going to get a lot of haters, but I didn't think it was that great. It was a burger, just a burger, unicorns did not fly out of my mouth & I did not see angels twittering about.   Frankly, I'd rather eat at a Smashburger."}
{"text":"In-N-Out represents the burger.  Fresh cut fries, oh yeah.  Dropkicks any fast food burger chain.  Most likely to be crowded because of this.  The drive through takes a minute too, but the real deal with In-N-Out is the secret menu.    Watching a friend eat a 4x4 animal style is impressive, so be hip to the secret menu and rock yourself a flying dutchman."}
{"text":"After spending the afternoon hiking at Red Rocks, my family went to In n Out for a quick meal. Our experience was wonderful. Every employee we interacted with was genuinely helpful and positive. Our orders (all double doubles with different toppings) were all correct and delicious. We are from the Midwest and have only been to In n Out twice, but based on our experience, we understand why it's so popular."}
{"text":"It was ok not all that wish it was hot. The service is good so why not the food???? I would give them another try"}
{"text":"Arizona may be hot in August but at least they have In-N-Out to make it bearable.  The thing I like most about them is no matter where you are they always are consistent.  My double double animal style is as good in Prescott as it is in Vegas, Dallas, or SoCal.  Keep up the great work and please come to San Antonio soon!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out baby!!! Best fast food burgers in town. Order fries and burgers animal style for a real treat."}
{"text":"The In-N-Out burger closest to the strip is jam packed.  It's located just of the I-15 which makes it probably the busiest In N Out in the Valley.  This location serves up the traditional menu and offers the same great flavor and service you come to expect from In N Out."}
{"text":"Its super busy restaurant.. the drive through are always preferred so even for one buger you have to wait min 15-20 mins.. but the burgers are cheap and very tasty.."}
{"text":"Just flew in, my wife starving. Craving an in n out burger since we left Denver this morning. Got here and was greeted at the door by a young man working the dining room.  He opened the door with a huge smile! Then as we waited for our burgers, he noticed it was taking a little longer than usual and he went to check on our food and even delivered it to our table and apologized for the long wait.. simply amazing! Never has this happened at an In n out in all the years I've been coming. He did not have to do this, but he did it and with a smile!  Great way to begin our Lil get away! His name is Matt!! Thank you for the great service, Matt!"}
{"text":"What's to say that's not already been said? I write this from the busy drive thru of another Vegas area In n Out. Truly delicious and fresh. Simple menu, good food,  very efficient service.  A must try!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for quite a while since I live three miles away and my brother attends Copper Canyon so we go after school, etc. We love their burgers! We get four double-doubles with everything, two regular fries, and two lemonades. I have to say their burgers are SOOOO good but their fries and lemonade aren't as satisfying. I really think they need to work on the fries because they're always either all dry, I get a little bit, or they just taste bad. The lemonade always tastes like mostly water and hardly any lemon, and it has a weird taste when eaten together. I would recommend this place for this friendly service and their delicious burgers but not for their fries nor lemonade."}
{"text":"People travel from all walk of the Earth to dine in an infamous InNOut Burger.  Really this place is amazing.  I think it's crazy that we almost take the In-N-Out burger for granted.  I am positive if I moved somewhere that doesn't have this place I would probably be clinically depressed.  OK, maybe not that sad, but pretty sad.    In-N-Out burger is all about the secret menu.  Secret menu you ask?  I am talking animal style!  What is animal style?  It's a mustard-cooked patty with additional pickles, cheese, spread and grilled onions diced up and mixed together on the grill before getting dumped on your burger.  Yes it's pretty much the most awesome burger ever.  I also get chopped chilies on my burger.  This will put some extra kick on you burger.  Don't forget to get a double double or if you are feeling adventurous then go for the 3X3.    What's great about the IN N Out is the the prices are pretty reasonable.  The restaurant can get pretty packed.  Sometimes they are slow to clean the tables.  So you end up guarding the table you want to sit at waiting for someone to come clean it.  If you have guest from out of town that aren't from California you have to take them to In-N-Out burger.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries are okay. I have to try that animal style :) the bad thing about this place is there's not that much room to eat and you'll be waiting on your car to the outside for a bit..it gets packed afternoon."}
{"text":"Glad they have good holiday hours. Came here on New Year's Eve before the big night. It's like any other in n out location.  I was greeted by a friendly face at the drive thru which went quick. I got a double double with everything in it. The burger turned out good, looked nice, and tasted great. Food and service was excellent. Overall, I'm glad I chose to come here even though I'm from Cali. It's a good addition in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ok so, I'm backing away from eating so much red meat these days but see, what had happened was, someone recommended this joint.  Kinda glad he did because it was good lol.  This was my cheat day and boy did I do it up. I got that double double ONLY with raw onions, pickles, ketchup and lettuce and it was fantastic.  I was almost tempted to get another one but I didn't. The quality of their burgers are great, have some weight and are reasonably priced.  I took pictures here on Yelp but I'm learning that some of my pics disappear when I use Yelp's camera option and don't post the review right away.  I'll just use my phones' camera instead. This is a franchise burger joint but they're only West Coast based.  They're good and have excellent customer service with their little vintage soda jerk hats on. I'm not calling them jerks, that's the name of those hats. Overall, I enjoyed it and recommend if you're on the West Coast."}
{"text":"Coming from California, I've been to about 10 different In-N-Out locations, but this is my favorite one by far. Every time I visit Vegas, I like to stop here for a burger, fries, and a shake.  There's nothing really special here that you wouldn't get at another In-N-Out. What sets this place apart is its consistency. Its burgers, fries, etc. are always prepared to perfection every time. Elsewhere I've experienced cases where the buns or fries might be slightly soggy, or the burger just not quite done right, but not here.  87/100"}
{"text":"Best burger ever.  They are made fresh - the place is so crowded they keep pumping them out, so they aint sitting around, under lights, or whatever.  People take cabs to this place, and the parking lot is a real cluster.  Gottabe animal-style, or you get arrested - the only thing you can get arrested for in Vegas, other than drinking a Coors Light in the dugout at a softball game, but that's another story."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised - much better than McDonald's/Burger King/Wendy's, and I'd venture to say that it's even better than Five Guys. I got the cheeseburger and fries, both animal-style, with some of their fresh pink lemonade. In terms of fast food, this might be the best you can get."}
{"text":"Oh in-n-out burger, how I love thee so...  There is nothing more to say.  It's delicious, consistent and fast.  If only they could get rid of the  guilt."}
{"text":"Ok, so what can I say about In - N - Out that I haven't already said, probably very little, but here it goes  Here is what I want out of my In-N-Out Burgers.  1. Super Fresh Burger cooked exactly how I ask for it. 2. Super Clean Restaurant and Bathrooms 3. Super Friendly Staff  Everything was great here, except for one of our burgers had no lettuce and had twice the tomatoes.  Hmmmmmmmmmm, never seen that before.  Big issue?  Not at all.  Surprising?  Yes, they are usually so spot on.  Am I a fan still?  Um, yeah, of course, love this place and will be back next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Ein absolutes Muss für alle USA Besucher. Wer erstmal die frisch zubereiteten Pommes, die Burger (wie auf dem Plakat) und besonders den süchtig machenden Schoko-Milchshake probiert hat, der versteht auch die lange Warteschlange (40 min im Drive Inn) -Tip: im Auto wartet es sich viel bequemer. Es gibt Hamburger, Cheeseburger und DoubleDouble (doppelt Käse, Doppelt Fleisch). Als Vegetarier hatte ich den Grilled Cheese, also Käse statt Fleisch. Und zu den Pommes Extra Spread. Lecker 5 Sterne"}
{"text":"dude , really? it's In-N-Out...  my favorite is the \"protein style\" double cheeseburger. which is; instead of buns, they wrap the entire burger in a big leaf of lettuce.. i can eat this stuff everyday!  fries? i like  mine with cheese and grilled onions only and topped off with ketchup..   nom nom !"}
{"text":"Pretty sure I am the exception to the In-n-Out craze. Everyone for years has been touting this chain as the best of the best.   After stopping for lunch at this location I got the following:   *Stale bun falling apart *Mediocre dry burger  *Inconsistency with secret menu ordering -- they f-ed up their own item.  *Sad-ass, stale fries   Maybe it's because I'm from a state where burgers are a 8th level to the nutrition pyramid, but these burgers were absolutely not worth the hype. The experience was almost on-par to McDonald's, but worse.   Yep, this goes under the big ol' book of fails.   You'll be fighting for seating during peak hours, but the staff was pretty nice and on it, which is why I'm adding a star to the experience.   Nope, nope and more nope.   Don't settle for the hype, people. Stop lying to yourself."}
{"text":"I am a local who lives quite close to this burger joint and I have come to this In-N-Out a lot. Also being a consumer of their burgers for more 30 years, you'll find this review helpful.  My regular order is a 4x4 animal style, protein style, easy sauce burger with fries well-done and a large lemonade. 4x4 (aka 4 by 4) takes its base burger format from the double double, e.g. meat, cheese, meat, cheese; the result of ordering a burger ends up being meat, cheese, meat, cheese, meat, cheese, meat, cheese. Animal style burgers are made fresh daily with mustard grilled into the meat. Protein style means no bun, wrap the burger in one big leaf of lettuce. Ordering this back in the 70s and earlier was a big secret. Now, not so much. But the quality is always good and they don't miss a beat taste or presentation. Well done fries means the fries are made crispier, almost potato chip crunchy on the outside. Great change up on the regular order of fries.  Everyone is courteous. The food comes out quickly and well presented. The only real drawback is that there are better burgers in town filled with burger competition.  What's my bottom line? Give them your money and eat their food. The price is right for what they have and it is a drive-thru, fast food joint giving you quality for your buck. My actual rating is a solid 4.1 stars..."}
{"text":"Of course they always have good food. This location is right off the strip and a slight walk from the south end."}
{"text":"Haven't had In N Out in a while so we stopped by this location earlier today.  I gotta do this more often! It itsn't the greatest burger I've ever had, but as far as fast food goes, they provide a solid product at a reasonable price.   The service we recieved was friendly and somewhat fast, all things considered. There always seems to be a long line at most In N Outs, but I think that due to the fact that they have good burgers as opposed to slow employees.  I enjoyed sinking my teeth into that nice, juicy, fresh tasty burger that came with a basket of copious amounts of fries! I almost want to say that the burgers were better at Five Guys, but the prices at Five Guys are just completely rediculous. The three of us were able to eat here for under 15.00, which I think is more than reasonable.  Only complaint is that those booths are rediculously tiny! They were NOT made for 4 people to use! None of the three of us are large people. I am the \"largest\" at 5'7 and 170 and I felt like we had to get a little too cozy to fit in there. Next time Ill get it to go! ;)  Other than that, I love In N Out and I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place hits the spot. If you've tasted the greatness of an in n out fast food burger, then you know what I mean. This review is more for the customer service and the overall cleanliness of the facility.   Customer service: the employees all greeted my friends and I when we walked into the door. It really seemed like their assembly line was legit and they kept their customers first. What I mean by that is I didn't see any workers talking to one another while serving customers, or taking the occasional cigarette break in the middle of their shift. The cashier also repeated my order to make sure it was totally correct, thank you! I even had a happy employee when giving my food and upon asking for more spread :)  Facility: bathrooms=CLEAN. Finally a place that knows that toilet paper isn't an item that belongs all over the floor. Tables were also cleaned up and washed down immediately after customers left. The soda fountain station was also cleaned up many times as I was sitting waiting for my to go order.  Overall my experience at this location was excellent. I wouldn't mind going back at all when I'm looking for my in n out fix in Vegas ;)"}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum. This location did it disappoint. Animal-stoe burger and fries. Amaze balls!"}
{"text":"Stayed at the Linq hotel and found this In-N-Out within the shopping center outside. The location itself is quite small inside. The menu is the same as any other In-N-Out but the pricing is definitely more expensive. I ordered a cheeseburger with grilled onions and French fries. When waiting for my order, we attempted to find seating and there was none available. The wait time to receive our food was quite long because they were very busy. Eventually other guests left and we were finally able to find seating after about 15-20 min.   Once we received our food, it wasn't up to the normal In-N-Out standard I'm used to in CA. The buns seemed a little dry and would crumble a little when you would hold it. The French fries were definitely a disappointment. They were so salty we couldn't really finish them.   Because we were so hungry, the food did its job but overall I probably won't come to this location again."}
{"text":"I have to eat at one of these burger joints when I'm on the west coast! It's simply the best!"}
{"text":"Great clean, fresh, made to order burgers with crispy fresh ingredients! Get anything and everything \"animal style\" for an extra punch of flavor and a savory heaven-sent taste-bud explosion experience. (Okay, enough with the drama...) I got a regular hamburger \"animal style\" and a protein animal style burger. Both were excellent, but there's something about the slightly toasted bun that had an essence of sweetness to it that I found addictive. The service took about 8-10 minutes, but they were friendly and it was only an inconvenience as I was in a pinch... Definitely willing to partake again, but not high on my to-do list."}
{"text":"Très bon comme d'habitude attention pour les puristes il y a les menus cachés et oui et il y a aussi la boutique à côté du restaurant."}
{"text":"Quick, good burgers especially for the price! Fresh cooked French fries! Thank you in n out Burger"}
{"text":"Number one animal style is excellent. Check the Internet for In N out burgers secret menu. Animal style is a mustard grilled patty with pickles and grilled onions. This burger has incredible flavor, and beats many high dollar burgers around town.  (Check my review for the Grind... ) Great shakes also - secret menu allows you to mix and match new shake flavors which is totally cool. You can't beat In-N-out for both flavor and value. And you can buy a cool In-n-out shirt for $8 - wear it proud!"}
{"text":"Double double, animal style. Perfect. Animal style fries aren't really my thing, but I ate half anyway. Ordered a chocolate shake. It had malt in it, which I love but my fiance was confused by. Drive thru was very busy, the line wrapped around the building. It wasn't a long wait though, and so worth it. You wont find a better tasting fast food burger."}
{"text":"The best fast food burger around.  The best items arent even on the menu. 3x3 animal style please.  Though its great, its still fast food."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating there. I was surprised at the extremely fast and extremely friendly service! I had a bit of a conversation with the cashier guy who asked me where I was from because he was surprised I'd never eaten In and Out! As for the food, I ordered a plain Cheeseburger with Ketchup, Mustard and Pickles, Fries, and a chocolate Milkshake. The first thing I tried was the shake. It was thick, and cold... but you could tell it was a fast food milkshake. The fries were good tasting but they were soggy and by the time I had eaten like ten of them they were already growing cold.  But the burger, while tasting like any fast food burger would taste, was better than most. I still prefer McDonalds in terms of fast food, but this was a close second.   Overall the best part of In and Out is their service, they should be commended for that."}
{"text":"There are so many places to eat in Vegas that I never even think about eating at places like In-N-Out anymore. However, last night my brother asked me to pick up some food for him, so I went here. Usually when I pass by, I see a pretty long line of cars in the drive-thru, but last night there were only a few cars in front of me and the line went by VERY quickly. I ordered a number 1: double double animal style, fries, and a Dr. Pepper for my brother and an animal style cheeseburger for myself. The person that gave me my food was pretty funny. I asked him for some ketchup and when I already had the bag in my hand he said, \"Oh, here's some ketchup..SLAM DUNK!\" and he put the ketchup in the bag as if he were really doing a slam dunk. The service itself deserves 4 stars. I was probably In-N-Out within five minutes.  Once I got home, I dug into my cheeseburger. It was mighty orgasmic. Imagine not eating chocolate (if you love chocolate) for a few months, then finally having a delicious chocolate truffle. That's how it was when I bit into the burger.. I've been going around town having all these \"gourmet\" burgers that I almost completely forgot how delicious In-N-Out burgers were. And the fries...oh the fries! So thin and crisp, so perfectly cooked, and soo tasty!  Hands down, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I love innout, though, very disappointed tonight. They got my burger wrong (I had to repeat me order a dozen times, still wrong), waited longer than necessary to be helped at the counter, and the burger they replaced mine with was not fresh. The meat wasn't very warm, the sauce was soaked in the bun like it was put on a while before, cheese was hardly melted, and hardly any lettuce. It's like they gave me a burger that was made 15 min prior, slapped some mustard on it and called it good."}
{"text":"Burger was good but the bun was bigger than the Burger, I kind of like my burgers to be too big for the bun. But on the other hand the animal fries was awesome fresh cut potato fries topped with American cheese and a relish sauce."}
{"text":"best burgers on the planet we know as earth!!! ask for the quadruple burger if you want to live the american dream!! oh and best service from every one of their staff members. i have been eating here for 12 years and have never had a bad experience once. i highly recommend to all!!"}
{"text":"I like the concept of the menu being super short and to the point, cheap, and simple basically. But I HATE everything that's on the menu. Except for the fries and the milkshakes."}
{"text":"I love In n Out and since I love it so much I know the menu and the prices. Today I was down with my work and I got a burger only and burger at it was 5 dollars. As a local it sucked but it is what it is. I normally pay 6.60 bucks for the mean so be ready for inflation major inflation. The burger was good like always but the prices suck"}
{"text":"Really good fresh food that is inexpensive. Their burgers tasted more like a burger from a diner than a fast food joint and that is a good thing. Just like Arnold, \"I'll be back.\""}
{"text":"Great staff and management that cares about hiring great people. Never have had an issue with the service, cleanliness or basic people skills in this or any location.  The food is what you would expect, basic. Thats not a bad thing. Meat and potatos stuff, right?  If you are in a hurry and not concerned about being impressed, this is the fast food of choice."}
{"text":"The standard after McDonald's if you want to step out up. Fries are good but taste completely different so be prepared some don't like it.  I like em but nothing special. Burgers are home run. Gorilla animal style it and enjoy. Gulp."}
{"text":"TOO GOOD!   Everything from the service to the food to the cleanliness and quickness. This in and out is one of my favorite locations. Reminds me of home, Cali. This food joint will always be one of my favorites cause it's fresh and you can't beat that."}
{"text":"Wow..... Just wow... Never had In-and-out burger in my 34yrs. What have I've been missing. Im from New Mexico so we dont have a In-and-Out burger there. We do have Blakes Lotaburger, which was similar in taste. But these guys do edge out Lotabuger. This place is a must when in Arizona. Now come yo NEW MEXICO!!!. Order was fast and quick. Lotaburger does cook your burger till you order though. So you know fresh patties. But if you want a quick bite and satisfying burger hit up In-and-Out ...5 All Day!!"}
{"text":"Once upon a time, a certain McBurger chain was the king of service and consistency. No matter what location you visited, you knew your burger would be delicious and the service was the industry standard. After what I witnessed at lunch today, I can safely say that torch has been passed to In-N-Out.  I've known that In-N-Out makes some of the best burgers anywhere, for years. They do it by focusing on one thing and doing it well. And they cook them to order. The former king \"assembles them to order\".  Today, at the In-N-Out north of ASU, I saw a well oiled machine in action. I pulled into a packed parking lot with a full drive-thru. I walked into a lobby that had just a couple seats left. And while I waited for my order, I watched the line stretch out the lobby doors. No one got upset or impatient. No one left or complained and they were all served in a timely manner.  How does this location manage to attract the crowds? You can't see it from the 202 until you're passing it. You can barely see it from Scottsdale Road. (Hint: Their reputation.)  My \"protein style\" (no bun) Double-Double and fries were freshly prepared, hot and delicious. And the service is impressive for its friendliness and competence. Lunch today was as busy as I've ever seen in any fast food restaurant. And the crew at In-N-Out handled it like it was any other day. Long live the new king!"}
{"text":"I got  to give In-N-Out Burger some love. I've been wrestling with a rating on this place for a long time. It's definitely a WIN when you can feed two hungry college aged boys and yours truly for under $15 bucks with some delicious food. They always get your orders right, keep the place clean and are UBER Friendly with fresh delicious burgers. No wonder this place is always mobbed well past the traditional lunch hours with families. Keep up the good work IN-N Out Burger!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love In-N-Out?! This is my go-to whenever I'm craving a burger. Their menu is simple, their ingredients are fresh and their staff is always super friendly. They also have a \"secret\" menu but I'm content with the basics. Only problem is they don't have any East Coast locations so all of my family & friends back home are missing out!"}
{"text":"I am from out of State but my husband grew up in Vegas so every time we are in California it Vegas we have to have In-N-Out. They repeated our order 3 different times which cracked us up but it was still wrong when we got it.  It was still good not as fantastic as my husband acts like it is. The fries were tasty.  For the price you really can't beat it. Just bring some patience bc that drive up line is forever long."}
{"text":"For being one of the first In-N-Out Burgers in Vegas, I remember back when I used to live in Henderson almost 10 years ago and how busy this joint was. Eating here reminded me of SoCal and this was the only location I knew of and now there's a handful. Still really packed and crowded, you'll need to grab the first available table. They still make consistent juicy burgers with animal fries and their yummy strawberry milkshake.... i could never get sick and tired of In-N-Out for real. Their cheerful attitudes, cool hats, and great burgers, fries, and shakes are the best."}
{"text":"I just moved over on this side of town a month ago, but of course I need to find the closest In-N-Out. Crazy busy like all In-N-Outs, but fairly quick and always delicious! But OMG! Best service I have ever received at an In-N-Out. Usually the workers at any location are great, but these guys go above and beyond. Everyone clearly works hard and serves with a smile. :) they even had two people head over to the doors to open it for you! So cute! Lol and everything tasted fresh. Glad this is my closest now!"}
{"text":"Stand in an hour line to eat crappy food off a crappy limited menu, I would rather just eat real crap."}
{"text":"in&out is the bomb. i've been going since i was little but what bothers me is a super long wait. i understand at lunch time or even during dinner but at 10 or 11 at night. let get these burgers flying!! i waited over 10 mins just to order. then another 10-15 to get my food, and this is in the drive thru. my food was great but i could have been home making something in that time. i supposed waiting is one of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to dining. if i want to get my drinks more that 15 mins, there is something wrong or im not in the right place."}
{"text":"First experience with this chain and it did not disappoint.  The location made it very busy and hard to find a seat but there were attendants everywhere keeping the tables clean and were very polite. Food was fast, hot and fresh.  It was a simple but tasty burger and the fries were hot and crispy."}
{"text":"This is usually an excellent in n out burger, but tonight my protein style burger was barely warm and the animal frys were clearly stale  They were cold. I parked so that I could enjoy a late dinner after flying in from a long week.od wprk out of state. I went out of my way to have dinner here. This was not up to their normal standards at all... Huge disappointmemt."}
{"text":"One word: amazing. If you've never had in-n-out...I'm so sorry! You can't even understand the deliciousness you're missing. I wish they would branch out to the Midwest, they're seriously that good, only problem with that is I would eat there too much and get crazy fat.  The cool thing with in-n-out (aside from the free paper hats) is that you can get their burgers wrapped in lettuce w/o sauce (protein style) and it's just as tasty as if you got the real thing; bun, sauce and all. The even better thing is that it doesn't taste like fast food.  You can tell that the meat, fries and everything in between are fresh. Plus the late hours are wonderful for those of us that don't have normal schedules or have been out too late partying on the strip. Staff here is also very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I just don't get it! The burgers are empty with barely any taste, the fries are always cold and leave a disgusting greasy film in my mouth, and the grilled onions taste like slimy slugs.  I want to like this place, I really do. I'm forced to eat it at least once every six months because every single person I know loves it and acts like it's Gods gift to fast food. (hence the psalms on the cups) This place is like fast food for elitists. \"I won't step foot into a McDonalds but In&Out is so indie and different that I'll allow them to serve me~\"  The hidden menu is what really gets me. Having \"secret items\" on your menu doesn't make you cool. It doesn't make your customers feel special or exclusive (unless they're idiots). It just makes me feel like you're too cheap to update the menu that you've had since the dawn of time.  Did I mention that there is ALWAYS a giant line? Both in the drive through and the dine in. Theres never a good place to sit and it's always packed. If I didn't know any better I'd think it was Club In&Out.  That being said, when I'm forced to eat it I'm unhappy but never physically ill like I am with another extremely popular place that I hate (chipotle). Also the employees are really friendly and service is pretty quick considering how long the lines always are.   I know I'll most likely continue going here with people close to me for the rest of my life but I would never pick it on my own or suggest it to outsiders."}
{"text":"John was a great employee. He got our complicated order correct quickly even though the lobby and drive-thru were super busy."}
{"text":"Tasty burger. Meat is softer than I like; if that makes sense. I'm more of an angus steak burger kind of gal. But for the price and the simple fact that it's fast food I'd say this falls right behind Shake Shack. The fries are better here, as that's a complete let down at shake shack. But their burger is superior in texture, quality and taste. Overall the animal offering made for mega flavor impact and the drink choices were plentiful. Food is fresh, hot and made to order. Does have a slight fast food crack taste to keep you coming back. Not sure if I was just overly hungry or what, but the double felt light in comparison to say a double quarter pounder (McDonald's) and not the old one but the new ones made from fresh ground meat. They are just heartier. So that's my review of having finally tried in-n-out as when I lived in Los Angeles I was a vegan and couldn't eat it. Solid place to eat and the prices are unbelievable. Easily half of what I paid at Shake Shack and even McDonalds for that matter.   P.S. hubby says he disagrees about the fries. He prefers Shake Shacks fries as well as their burger. We did not try the milk shake. Oh, and the potato bun is more solid than the softer, mushy bun at in-n-out"}
{"text":"I went here after volunteering and the service was poor and they messed up our order countless times"}
{"text":"We arrived at In N Out ready to eat some Guaranteed Fresh TM fries. But when I bit into them I found the only thing saltier then the fried potatoes, was my mood after eating that meal."}
{"text":"It gets SUPER busy and seating is hard to get.  Double double animal protein style.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Nice that they put an In-N-Out here. What more needs to be said?  In-N-Out is love, In-N-Out is life.  Thank you for delivering a high quality meal at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Whenever I am on the West Coast, In N Out is my number one destination.  I had to have this before I left Las Vegas.  Best farewell meal ever.  My go to is always a Double Double Animal Style and Protein Style/Animal Style.  That way you still get the benefit of the bun, but when you want more and eat the protein style.. you won't be too full already.  If you get the fries animal style, ask for them well done.  Service is always amazing at every In N Out I've been to.  Everyone that works there takes pride in what they do and are genuinely nice.  Skip the drive thru and just ask your cab driver to wait outside for you while you run in to get food.  The line goes by fast and you get your food fairly quickly. Then off to the airport you go."}
{"text":"Always a go-to place to take out of towners.  I'm not sure what the best part of the meals is here... Could it be the french fries which are cut fresh from potatoes? (you can see the guy behind the counter slamming them through a manual press).  Perhaps it's the fresh lettuce or tomatoes with that tangy sauce.  Whatever it is, I'm always prepared to wait (especially at this location) but it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out Drive thru was hopping on a Friday night, thankfully they have a actual person taking order for the cars waiting in line, that way payment is smooth at the 1st window and the food is ready to go when you pull-up to the second.  Food was still warm when I came home and absolutly delicious as usual.  When I do get fast food, I always make it In-N-Out because nothing else compares.  Google their \"secret menu\" to order special prepared items!"}
{"text":"4 Stars for Fast Food?? But, they do it SO RIGHT!!! In-N-Out really does! If I have to Grab on the Go - This is Go to SPOT! No question about it. No matter what city, where we land, the food is always yum! And thanks to a lettuce wrapped burger (Protein Style) I never have that Fast Food stomach ache that I would always get from the more traditional fast food places. No, I don't need to name names...you know who they are!"}
{"text":"Never had In & Out Burgers until moving to Arizona...All I can say is AMAZING!!! So simple yet perfectly made with the number one ingredient that makes this quick bite Burger stand up against the rest...LOVE; it was very obvious that the founder and owner of in and out have a dedicated passion for what they do, and I feel so crazy writing a review like this about a quick bite establishment. It is very clear when a place like this is so successful with only three menu options they got it right. I will be back!! Just thinking about it as I'm writing this review makes me want to take a drive and go get one. YUMO"}
{"text":"ok finally tried one non-animal style in LA and it is definitely much better. Still overrated but is a tasty burger"}
{"text":"First time to eat here... delicious. Next time I'm out west-ish... I'll be back. Long line... moved fast... good people watching."}
{"text":"Always fresh never frozen! Freshly made fries and buns everyday. A awesome family owned Christian based business that has a culture to its procedures. They even provide staff training at In n Out \"University\" to properly train the staff with the work culture up to expectations. They have verses printed on packaging. Check out my pictures. Theirs also a hidden menu you can find online. If you like spicy ask for pepperchinis in your burger...they have a kick."}
{"text":"Very overrated the food had too much salt that's the burger and the fries the shake was too thick to use a straw so let's call it the low quality soft serve ice cream it is. Shake shack, 5 guys sheesh even wendys would be a better option."}
{"text":"It's In-N-Out versus the world. Which says something, when everyone is willing to hate on your product at the drop off a single animal style fry.   Is the food good?, Yes. You have to try really hard to mess up a burger and fries, but, I'm not here to talk about the delicious treats served here, but the service. This is the kind of place that will literally do anything within reason to serve its customers...  - You want neapolitan shake?... coming right up.  - You want animal style fries on your double double and you want it protein style?... You got it.  - Grilled cheese?... got it! - You want an animal style milkshake?... small or medium?   You really have to fail at life if you can't properly order from this menu. Even if it's you're first time here, because the menu is so basic. Burgers, fries, and shakes. Done!    Beyond the one million food algorithms you can create here, the prices are still considerably lower than any other fast food place. I mean my order is almost always under six dollars and is sufficient enough to feed the beast. A double double, fries, and water. Yeah. I don't drink soda.   Plus the food is good! Don't believe the haters. No one really hates In-N-Out, besides vegetarians, but they have veggies options available! Really, anyone who hates In-N-Out is probably just a spiteful jerk who looks for the bad in everything. I can name a few people right now... Skeletor, Thanos, Tuco from Breaking Bad, Cosmo G. Spacely from the Jetsons, and a few humans on YT.   P.S. - If you go late at night. Go inside, it's faster than drive through. America!"}
{"text":"The Double Double is just the Best Best burger in the universe."}
{"text":"The Double Double is just the Best Best burger in the universe."}
{"text":"Always fresh and fantastic!  You can never go wrong with in-n-out! They are always fast and the people who work here are super friendly.  When you want something fast but high quality this is your spot."}
{"text":"Initially, the lines were out the door. However, the wait was under 10-15 minutes, and the food came out within another 10-15 minutes. Food itself was very good. When we went, the place was packed so we were forced to eat outside; however, we didn't mind since the weather was phenomenal. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I now know what all the hype is all about. Fast and efficient service for one, although the line was long in the 30 minutes I was there they served numbers 41-82! The burgers are fresh, well cooked and tasty. I ordered mine from the not so secret menu \"protein style\" wrapped in crisp lettuce topped with fried onions along with some delicious fries. NomNomNom"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this location.  I've received absolutely fantastic service upon every visit over a year: fast, friendly, FANTASTIC.  Thank you guys for serving my late night needs every time."}
{"text":"My first time here! Thank you fellow Yelpers for pointing me to the secret menu! The secret menu is what their non-secret menu offers + grilled onions and extra sauce. For ex. The Hamburger \"animal style\" is hamburger with grilled onions and extra sauce.  They also offer a grilled cheese which is the burger without the patty. Simple, fresh burgers without the frills but the friendliest service you'll ever experience."}
{"text":"In n Out Burger totally lives up to the hype. We ate here basically every day for lunch when we were in Arizona. A double double with grilled and raw onions plus a chocolate shake...I wonder if I lived near an In n Out Burger, how soon I would get sick of it? I bet it would take awhile."}
{"text":"Go to Lenny's or McDonald's. Diahrreah is better than waiting for 30 minutes for a screwed up order and paying again for the right one. Wanna wait a half hour, pay twice and not eat once? Come here then... Overrated"}
{"text":"In N Out is just a classic. You have to stop here if you are out west. It's just a must. Just like shake shack is a must out east. The burgers are great though, they taste a little healthier and not as greasy which is nice. And the fries and shakes are great too!"}
{"text":"As a New Yorker, I am always on the lookout for a great burger. Finally on the West coast, I had to give this burger a try.   This is not exactly a fast food restaurant but they only take about ten minutes to make your food. This place was also very packed so the short wait time was pretty impressive. The downside was that it was not open 24/7.   I got the double-double burger with fries and a vanilla milkshake so I could get the whole experience. The burgers were alright. I think Umami Burger, Shake Shack, and Five Guys have much better burgers. It was really cheap though, around $3.95 for the burger so the whole meal cost about $6 or so. The milkshake was not impressive whatsoever and the fries were terrible. Overall, I am not impressed."}
{"text":"Food here is amazing i love it best burger around yummmmmmy always fast but always bizzy because there so good the staff is always friendly"}
{"text":"This place is too good.  I've been coming here for years and i feel this is the best location in town. The fries are perfect and so are the burgers.  I now get a 2x2 animal protein style with fries and a lemonade, a far cry from my puberty-driven 6x6s but its still great."}
{"text":"This is a great location. We stop here on our way to the Anthem Outlet Mall. I like to get the grilled cheese which is a burger without the meat. Their fries are so good. If you like them crispier you can ask for them well done. This restaurant is always clean and the people are always friendly and helpful. Food comes out fast and fresh."}
{"text":"My first time ever having In&Out burger! I've waited for years to try this place! I love the fries. Thin and crispy and cooked perfectly. My burger was the freshest tasting fast food burger I've ever had. The patty was very very thin however. That's my only complaint."}
{"text":"This location hasn't been on point when taking orders via drive-thru. So if you're in a rush I would pass this location up.  Burgers and everything else is still good, but if I can't trust that my food comes out the way I ask and pay for... Then why bother going back. This location hasn't been on point when taking orders via drive-thru. So if you're in a rush I would pass this location up.

{"text":"While I'm not quite empathetic of the absurd fanaticism of In-n-Out fans, it's still super easy to enjoy a bite from here as the main flavor is FRESH.  While the drive thru line looks long, don't kid yourself thinking you'll save time by walking in. These guys crank out food as efficiently as possible, but it still takes time.   You really can't go wrong with anything here as there aren't a lot of options. My recommendation is that you eat the fries first; as they are fresh cut, they aren't extra crisp from a double fry, and they're kind of flaccid... so eat them while they're hot as their desirability weakens rapidly.  Fantastic staff, like most In-n-Outs. When in Vegas..."}
{"text":"You can always expect to see young but extremely hardworking people working at In-n-out.  I only ordered fries, but there are no other fries that compare to this old classic."}
{"text":"Yeeessh. INOB on the Linq wasn't delicious. The waiting area was a mob scene of impatient tourists, looking for a better burger than what this particular INOB was dishing up.   Bun was crusty, over sauced, double double.   The strawberry shake was good, though.   It is what it is, though, I should have had a gyro."}
{"text":"delicious burger! I got the #1, was cooked to perfection. my cashier taylor told me all about gettin grilled onions on my burger, was the best part and I'll definitely come back to have that again. she greeted me with a smile, and is my favorite worker now!"}
{"text":"Came here for a burger and milk shake, the burger was great, no line, the only problem was that they forgot to give us our milk shake. We did not realized it until we were far away."}
{"text":"This would be my second time here at In N Out. My first time was in California. I ordered an Animal Style burger with regular fries. It wasn't out of this world, but I enjoyed it.  Knowing this place is really hyped, I decided to come to In N Out again. This location was more crowded than the last one, so I had trouble finding seats. However, we found some at the end. It was a table for two, so I decided to let my parents sit while I stand. I ordered the same thing as last time- Animal style burger and fries. The wait time was a bit longer than the location in California, but that was probably because there were more people. When I recieved my order, I was surprised. I somehow received Animal style fries, as well! Of course, we were charged extra. I take the benefit of the doubt and say that I miscommuniated and said something wrong. My parents didn't look too happy. Feeling a bit guilty, I went ahead and tried to eat the too layer for them.  It was the best thing of my life. I found eating the fries Animal Style so much better than eating them plain. Well- not SO much better.... It was just a unique experience. I thought it was delicious. It went really well with my burger and I was more filled up than last time I went (in which I ordered regular fries)."}
{"text":"dazu gibt's wohl nicht viel zu sagen: ob mittags, abends oder tief in der Nacht: mein preferred Burger Laden wenn ich im Linq nächtige. Am liebsten so Voodoo Bürger = in Salat anstelle eines Pappbrötchens eingeschlagen. Für die, die es nicht wissen: Hackfleisch wird vor Ort frisch durch den Fleischwolf gejagt und die Kartoffeln für die Fritten werden auch frisch zubereitet."}
{"text":"Simple. Good. Is there a name for it if you were to order \"Animal fries\" with no cheese??"}
{"text":"Loved it. The only down part is that this location is super super busy. Getting a table is super hard.  Burger was fresh and tasty. Love that they have picked chilies as a condiment. The fries could be a little more crisper."}
{"text":"In-N Out protein style is when they do a lettuce wrap instead of the bun.  Omgoodess, that is so awesome for me since I don't do gluten (I'm on a modified paleo lifestyle).  I scrape a lot of the processed American cheese off and if you ask for sauce on the side, they will give you the packages of their special sauce so you can put as little (or as much) as you want.  My sister likes to put more and I like a little.    They have fresh fries using fresh potatoes and I appreciate that.  We go to this one since it's closer to my aunt's place and we get to go to Whole Foods as well (since it's a couple of blocks away).  This location has been consistently clean, the teens working there have all been trained very well; they are polite, efficient and accommodating as much as they can be.  They smile, they greet and it's welcoming.  This location has always been busy, either the drive-thru or sit in but they work fast in the kitchen so the wait usually isn't really that long.  Their milk shakes from from a machine so it's not made to order (with milk and ice cream) so it's concentrated stuff which I'm not fond of.  So there's no way for you to ask for it to be thicker or thinner if you have a preference in your milkshake texture.  I hope that is something they will look into, having an ice cream and milk blender (I thought they did before hence the milkshakes always taking long to make) so that it goes with their motto of cooking food \"the old fashion way\"."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place for a cheeseburger and fries here in Phoenix.  Simple menu.. classic burger, fries and milkshakes.  Made fresh, never frozen, with superior service and friendly staff.  You won't find better."}
{"text":"This place was of course good and the staff were upbeat and friendly. When im in the area will always go to this place. People could learn alot from the way this staff acts."}
{"text":"I gave it a 2 because the service was good but the food is trash. The west coast peeps hype this place up for nothing. It's a tomato, lettuce, and onion sandwich with a slice of meat. The fries are drier than the Arizona air, too. The hype isn't real..."}
{"text":"You either like In-N-Out, or you don't. I happen to love it - can't get over how little everything costs - but the sheer amount of people in such a small space was overwhelming. They have it down to a science, but I found myself crammed amongst a bunch of strangers for 15 minutes while I waited for my food, and then we had to eat outside in the heat because there were no tables left inside. It hit the spot but I don't know that I'd go back to this location in particular."}
{"text":"Fast Food at it's best!    Guaranteed U won't be disappointed.    Fresh and clean.  Employees care and it shows because they all aim to please.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"Pretty much the best, freshest, burgers and fries you can get. Can't beat the price. Always try to make it here when im in town. My only complaint is that they don't do hand dipped shakes."}
{"text":"This is right near our house and our got to fast food restaurant.  The burgers are the best and I love that the french fries are fresh.  They have all kinds of add ons and special orders.  Check their website for their secret menu"}
{"text":"The first time we ever went, I was disappointed that they only had burgers and fries on the menu. I no longer stand by that disappointment! The burgers are VERY fresh, the lettuce, tomato, and onions very crisp, the sauce they use is delicious. I'm picky with fries, but these were perfect fast-food fries, crunchy, not too greasy, soft on the inside. Whenever we crave burgers, we go here!"}
{"text":"I love in n out  I actually had it for dinner today... All the locations I've been to have been great, they've all had great service and have never messed up any of my orders! This is my local in n out, I love going there, always happy and friendly people working there and always clean! Don't forget to grab a Neapolitan shake with those fries (;"}
{"text":"Love this In-N-Out... even when the line is long. Burgers always come out hot and I've never had a problem with them being out of any drinks in the fountain (one of my pet peeves.) Sometimes the fries aren't steaming hot but honestly, it's nbd. Never leave feeling disappointed, unless it's so busy we can't find a seat!"}
{"text":"I love it here, when I can actually find a seat...  It's quick, staff is nice, and the food is always hot and fresh.  The inside really should be bigger for the location, since sometimes there's no seats available to paying customers.  The other day I was watching the staff from the waiting bench and they are so fast and impressive. Pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Simply the best \"fast food burgers\" in town. Simple menu, great cooking styles... A classic that others can't imitate"}
{"text":"It is a greasey burger, their onions are strong even when cooked which usually carmelizes and mellow them out.  I enjoyed Smashburger a bit more"}
{"text":"Pretty indifferent about InO.  Not the worst, not the best. I never plan going, its more of a spontaneous \"I am hungry and they're the first I see that are convenient to turn into\""}
{"text":"Ah, greatness in simplicity.  When you first walk in, you notice kitchen is open and meticulously clean.  The staff is friendly and smiling.    I went with the #1, animal-style (double cheese burger).  The lettuce and tomato on the burger are cold, crisp, and fresh.  They help contrast the heat and texture of the two beef patties.  The carmelized onions/thousand island dressing add a bit of sweetness to compliment the flavor note.   The fries are shoestring and fresh cut.  They have that homemade taste.  These are my favorite fast food fries.  All in all, In n Out is a great example of how a fast food operation should be ran.  The quality control, pooled with efficiency and simplicity make the experience here great."}
{"text":"Exceptional burger at great price. You know you are in a quality restaurant when there's a long queue and especially when there's only 4 burger options. This means that they do not mess with the recipe and master their craft in a few!"}
{"text":"This is easily the worst In-N-Out anywhere in the country. Forget about the average service and complete lack of hospitality (which you get in spades in most other In-N-Outs), what does this location in is pricing. You will easily pay 30%-40% above standard In-N-Out prices for the same food. I get that the location is in a tourist mall on the Vegas Strip, but when you go to the Starbucks in the same location you pay standard national pricing. If a megalith like Starbucks can do it, why can't a Christian company like In-N-Out do the same?"}
{"text":"Trust me - go here and get the number 1, Animal Style, and you can thank me later. It's the best burger anywhere.  For those who are really interested, there is a \"secret\" menu that allows you to order food protein style (no bun), or a triple or even a quad, or the mythical grilled cheese.  I advise you to avoid the grilled cheese, but everything else is great.  I like to sub a milkshake for the included beverage, and you can't go wrong with this option."}
{"text":"To preface this review, I had never been to In-n-Out before and I am from the East Coast. So perhaps take my review with a grain of salt because I'm probably biased. Either way, when I found out that Vegas has In-n-Out, I knew I had to try it - if only to further support my argument that Shake Shack is better.   We arrived in Vegas just 2-3 days after the new In-n-Out opened in the LINQ Promenade, so we didn't have to drive out to bumblefuck in order to get it. The line at about 9:30pm was relatively short and we got our burger relatively quickly. We took them back to our rooms since half of us wanted In-n-Out and the other half wanted Shake Shack (In-n-Out's vegetarian option is...to be it frankly, sad).   The fries, first of all, were just disappointing. They're regular fries - but overly salted fries. I dare to say that even McDonald's fries are better! The burger itself wasn't anything spectacular. I got mine Animal Style and it kind of just tasted like a \"real\" Big Mac. I didn't particularly enjoy it, but I didn't hate it either. My friend from San Francisco has already disowned me.   To be fair, we did eat it after it's been slightly cold. BUT even cold Shake Shack burgers are bomb. Again, I might be biased. Either way, I'd have In-n-Out if it's in the area, but I don't think I'd ever go out of my way to have it again."}
{"text":"As for \"fast food\" burgers, these are decent.  The BURGERS at least.  The fries?  Please.  They are AWFUL.  Let them get cold and they are WORSE THAN AWFUL.  Anyone who says these are \"the best burgers they have ever had\" has just not tried enough good burgers yet.  Try Lobby's.  Or Chuckbox.  Or Hillside Spot.  Or Deluxe.  Or Roaring Fork.  In-N-Out has decent \"fast food\" burgers.  But are they the BEST BURGERS ANYWHERE?  Not a chance."}
{"text":"Completely overrated, overcrowded, and underdelivered.  Yes, it's a decent burger.  A little better than McDonald's, not as good as Carl's Jr., but perplexingly an EVENT to attend.  The menu boasts three versions of the same burger, and if you snoop around online, you'll soon discover that a whole secret society of (gasp) OTHER WAYS to order those burgers in code exists.  So you go up there armed with your fancy shibboleth and get it ANIMAL STYLE.  Super-awesome, I'm sure, because that means extra sauce and also pre-mixed with mustard.  You know, like animals make burgers.  OK, again, these are good fast food burgers, and the price is appropriate (which is certainly welcome), but seriously... come on.... you know this was a total waste to come here, right?  Next you'll tell me you simply HAVE to go to White Castle."}
{"text":"I honestly DO NOT get the hype here. I remember years ago while still stationed in S.Ca eating at one near me. Even back then I thought they were a SCAM, and after having one years later they still are.  Seriously, they have no redeeming qualities at all.  I will take a Habit Burger or a Tommy burger any day of the week."}
{"text":"Went here for our family Christmas Eve dinner and it was delicious! Went back again and it was just as good. Being on a KETO diet IN N OUT is key! Protein style 3x3 is filling and delicious! I will be back very soon"}
{"text":"Quick service even during rush hour. Order was perfect too. Best of all, it's really cheap! Under $14 for 4 people (4 burgers and two fries). Good stuff, Inn N Out team!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the manager here Stephanie Parker! My family and I just dined in at the restaurant and while we received excellent service and enjoyed great food, we were especially impressed with Stephanie. After leaving the restaurant, my dad noticed that he had left his Backpack at the table we were sitting at. We called once and were told that nothing had been turned in and it wasn't found. When we called again, Stephanie found it right away and held it for us to go back and get. She was extremely helpful and professional as she verified the items and gave it back to my dad with everything still inside. We are so appreciative to Stephanie for going above and beyond to give us the best service possible. Thank you, Stephanie!"}
{"text":"You just can't go wrong at In-N-Out with a cheeseburger animal style (thousand island dressing and grilled onions) for $2.05.  A burger is $1.75.  It's also hard to imagine a busier location in the country than this one - located at I-15 and Tropicana, and maybe half a mile from the strip.  We came for a mid afternoon snack at 2:30pm, and the place was mobbed -  but the crowd was efficiently handled, and we ate within 20 minutes of arrival.  As good as it gets for this price range!"}
{"text":"So thankful for this In n Out location. It's close to home and the staff is AMAZING.   They are always checking in, making you feel less like you're at a fast food chain.   Everything tastes fresh - per usual In-n-Out-style. I always get the Protein Style burger because the lettuce is so fresh and tasty.   Do I even have to tell you to get the animal style fries?"}
{"text":"Why is the West Coast the Best Coast? In-N-Out Burger!!!  Seriously this fast food can't be beat. Everything is fresh and cooked to perfection. No one does it better."}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm not a meat-eater most of the time (but not by choice). I've had the burgers here a few times, and they are a good, no frills burger. This is a nice In-N-Out location, but it's usually packed so you will wait. What brings this place into the 4 star realm is the \"animal style\" option, the \"grilled cheese\", and the chocolate milkshake. Holy milkshake, so creamy delicious. So I know what you're thinking, grilled freakin' cheese here?!, but I'm serious. I can't and shouldn't eat the burger, but I can get the \"animal style grilled cheese\", i.e., everything minus the meat patty. It's very good, and it's an option for all you vegetarians that may get dragged here. The wait and the fries are the most disappointing. For some reason, I cannot stand their limp fries covered with a slice of American cheese. It's just...odd."}
{"text":"This place is always filthy. ALWAYS. I only come here because it's the closest to my house and I keep thinking they will change their ways.  I'm always let down. Cmon guys!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best \"fast food\" burgers I've ever had.  $5.50 for a double cheeseburger and fries after tax.  You cant beat that price, especially considering how good they taste.  We took a taxi from the Mirage and both ways it cost twice as much for the cab as the 2 burgers and 2 fries.  But it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"YUM! I love to dip my fries in my strawberry shake!   They have the best fountain pepsi also... I don't know how they mix it but it is heavenly.   I love the employees always are so respectful and polite with \"please\" thank you\" welcome\".    When they read your order back to you it is confusing because they don't say 3 of the #1 they break it down as 3 fries 3 burgers ect and I don't want to sound dumb but darn it when you have a large order and your tired it is beyond my brain waves to understand it LOL!  Why can' t they just say 3 number 1's!!  Just say yes as they have never gotten my order wrong.   All locations get very packed during peek hours so sometimes it's hard to find a seat.  They often have misters outside to keep you cooler if there is no seating available inside.  It is sometimes best to go with a friend and have 1 person go and save a table that opens while the other stands in line.  Food products are always fresh to order and you will never get fries or a burger that has been sitting under a heat lamp."}
{"text":"This is the most overrated place in existence.  The menu is limited, the fries taste like cardboard, and the burgers are thin, thin scrawny little patties.  I don't get it, and I certainly don't eat there anymore"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love this place?  Great burgers, fresh, and their fries..oh man.  Love their fries.  This place is just as packed as any other location throughout Vegas.  Thankfully they know how to keep it flowing.   If you want a great burger, fries, and shake for reasonable prices then come here.  It's awesome."}
{"text":"(4.5 Stars) I now know what all my Californians friends talk about when they visit me in Texas. In-Out Burger is the best fast food burger place hands down. Nevermind the simple menu of burger fries and shakes, they excel at what they have, and that's the tastiest fresh fast food burger in the fast food market.  Double Double Animal style burger (grilled onions and special sauce) with fries gets a 9/10 from me for a cheap fast meal in Las Vegas. Lots of lettuce tomatoes and onions. It's a little out of the way off the strip, but with a car, it's a Must-hit place if you've never had it.  I never thought I would give a fast food restaurant this many stars but if this place existed in my city, I would be overweight for sure. Go try it, highly reccomended."}
{"text":"This place is dirt cheap, high quality, and extremely delicious!  You must stop here during your Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I pulled up late on a busy Saturday night. The line was long both in store and at the drive thru so we decided to wait in the drive thru line. A young man named Thomas was standing in the line of cars taking orders on an iPad type thing. He was polite and professional and was moving the cars through very quickly. Samuel was also a rockstar at the first window. The moral of the story is that Thomas was cool and got our order right and we were pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Come on . Is not only the food that is constantly good, also the service is always quick and on point. Nice crew."}
{"text":"We drove through after our flight, and on our way to Sedona. We wanted something quick, and not the typical \"fast food\" stop. The staff was friendly and welcoming. The food was pretty much the same as any other in n out, however, the burgers and fries were packed differently than I'm used to, when we say that we're \"eating in the car\".   In California, the burgers and fries are placed in an open box so it's easy to pick up your burger and eat over something, so the sauce isn't all over your pants. They also provide you with \"lap mats\" for extra protection. When we saw the burgers in bags, no biggie, but that's not typically what \"eat in your car\" in n out style, means. We had to ask for lap mats, and then we were only given 2, for our party of 3. Is this just a California thing?  Just a difference worth mentioning for the out of towners like us. Thanks in n out, you hit the spot, and I didn't even mind the sauce stains on my pants!"}
{"text":"Waited too long today, by the time we received our shakes they were melted and warm, dislike.... 15 minutes to get a couple of shakes is not worth it, will chose another establishment next time"}
{"text":"I stand corrected... unbeknownst to me, I am told they are open 7 DAYS a week!!!  Pardon my previous review as I am a tourist only passing through!"}
{"text":"Love this place. GREAT customer service and the food is ALWAYS delish! Fast and prompt. I love the people who work here they are always polite and courteous. I never have a problem with my order. Whether I'm in the drive thru or dining in. Though either one can get pretty crowded. I prefer drive thru"}
{"text":"For a  fast food burger it's one of the best and there frys are fresh not frozen supper yummy fast food. FYI burgers only here. Everyone I have ever been to they have always been clean.big plus in my book.."}
{"text":"For fast food it's pretty darn good.. it's in and out what is there to say but yum... simple and good"}
{"text":"I feel so sorry for those on the east coast because frankly I don't think I could survive without in-n-out. My own little taste of California. Words cannot describe the coma I drift into after a satisfying #2 meal. It hits the spot!  I like the cheeseburger with grilled onion and extra pickles, and the french fries animal style. YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMY!  Always go through the drive thru -  it's a clutch after the club when there's nothing decent open."}
{"text":"I seriously do not get the appeal of this place!   I tried it quite a while ago back in California and didn't like it much. But everyone I know raves about it and it has been a while so I thought I'd try it again. Especially since it's so close to my house.   Blah. I got a cheeseburger with grilled onions, tomato, their sauce and pickles. I passed up lettuce because they use nasty iceberg lettuce. Can I get an upgrade? How about green leaf lettuce like is shown on their website? Also got fries and a Dr. Pepper. The Dr. Pepper was the greatest thing about the meal. OK, the service was good too. Very friendly, kinda creepily so.   The fries are just weird. I'm sure people say it's because they are fresh. OK, then I'll take un-fresh fries any day. These ones are just gross.   The burger is just nothing special. The flavor is not great. My burger wasn't even that warm by the time I got home, which is only a mile away. And it was 154 degrees inside my car. How does it get that cool in that quick of a time?   Again, another place I'll probably only return to for the Dr. Pepper. Clean place, good service, good energy, not so great food."}
{"text":"Fab Idea: Animal fries.  Another Fab Idea: Box so you can eat in your car without dying in a head-on collision as you fish your yummy burger from a bag bottom.  Extraordinarily Fab Idea: Paying your employees a decent sum so they actually smile and make eye contact when they give you your food. Some of these said employees actually talk and *gasp* make conversation, too."}
{"text":"In and out claims all natural oil used for their fries!!! I asked and they use COTTONSEED OIL! this is dangerous to consume!!!! It's a cheap \"garbage product\" in other words ...... It's a discard oil. The company pays $50 per year for this shit! That's the Wierd flavor u get when u eat them! Look it up on line. It's a carcinogen! Look it up! DONT EAT THE FRIES PEOPLE!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood In-N-Out restaurant. I always come to this In-N-Out location when me or my family don't feel like cooking at home. We always order the Double Double with fries and soda or known as #1 combo. I gotta say, it's always HOT AND FRESH. Once in a while, we order the Animal Style Fries and the shake, very delicious!   Everytime when I order my order by drive thru, depending on how many cars ahead of me, the staff here try to make your meals quick. The food here is always good and the colas for some reason here taste more fresh than other fast food joints.  I recommend if you are a tourist or a local looking for something quick to eat, eat here! The staff here are very friendly and they want their customers to always be satisfied with their service."}
{"text":"I've been at UNLV for over three years now, and I keep eating at the UNLV Student Union many times. This time, I want to try something else. As I walked around the area, I forgot there's an In-N-Out in the area. I came to this In-N-Out on Thursday, September 28, 2017 around 12 p.m. (lunch rush) and dined in. This place was packed especially the drive thru!   As always I ordered: #1 Combo - Double Double with grilled onions - French Fries - Large Vanilla Shake  While I was waiting, I might as well get prepared. I got my ketchup, black pepper, and yellow peppers. I only waited about 8 minutes which isn't bad since I'm getting fresh food off from the grill and fryer.  Voilà, perfect timing! I found a table in the corner. The Double Double was to die for! Has two patties, lettuce, tomatoes, spread sauce, and grilled onion just as I ordered. The French Fries were hot and crispy!  If you are tired of eating at random restaurants or expensive fast food, try eating here! My meal was under $10 which is not bad and the food is fresh made to order."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is one of the best burger places you can find in Vegas. They offer many different types of burgers from cheeseburger, hamburger, Double Double, and so much more. Their well known French Fries are so fresh that you can see them making it from scratch of cutting the potatoes into slices and frying them. In-N-Out also have the \"Secret Menu\" where you can order tons of stuff. You can find the \"Secret Menu\" in their website. The \"Animal Style Fries\" from the secret menu is the one I usually order and trust me, IT'S THE BEST! It has fried onion and their \"spread\" sauce. If you want to be fit, they have the \"Protein Style\" burger where instead of buns, they replace it with lettuce.  If you want more spice in your burger, they offer the \"Yellow Chili Pepper\" as one of the condiments. The chili taste very good with the burger and would probably make you sweat a little. Add the \"spread\" sauce to your burger and experience the taste of it. It may taste something that is very familiar.  If you want some dessert, you should try their shakes! Their shakes are very delicious and will make your stomach satisfied and happy.  Their fast food restaurants are always busy in the drive thru and inside. The facility inside In-N-Out is alright. They always have someone to clean up the restroom and the dining room.  Overall, In-N-Out is the best burger fast food restaurants I have ate so far because of they make everything from scratch."}
{"text":"After spending a high energy morning at the Mesa natural history museum, my daughter, 6 year old grandson, 3 year old and 6 month old granddaughters and I were famished for a filling and quick lunch. We stopped by this In-N-Out Burger at Fiesta Mall. In just a few minutes we had a double cheeseburger, cheeseburger, hamburger, fries, two drinks, and a chocolate shake--all for just $15.60 (including tax!). The food was exactly as ordered (a rarity with fast food places) and very tasty. The lettuce, onions, and tomatoes on the burgers were so fresh they tasted like they were right out of a garden.  The store is spotless, the employees are friendly, helpful, and even brought our food to the table for us. Maybe they saw that we had our hands full with 3 active small children and had mercy on us, or maybe they just saw the exhaustion on the adult faces. They even brought out paper hats and stickers for the 6 year old and 3 year old.  The menu is very limited, just burgers, fries, and drinks, but what they do, they do very, very well. We were all full and happy when we left."}
{"text":"Great food it was hot. The service was great. Make sure you have someone in your party to hold a seat before you order(if you are eating in). The place is usually packed."}
{"text":"Over hungry and over-tired 2 year old, 4 year old, 7 year old, and 10 year old made fast food a necessity. We had been kept waiting too long at a nearby photo studio and we were now into melt-down mode, so we needed to be refueled fast.   This In-N-Out burger fit the bill. The usual fast service, tasty food, and super clean dining area were a lifesaver. We had cheeseburgers, fries, milk for the kids, and a shake for me. Staff was friendly and efficient. I fed 6 people for around $23. We left full and much calmer."}
{"text":"Second time this has happened to me.  waited thirty minutes just to get cold food. They need to start hiring more people at night! I saw my food on the county just chilling there until my cashier came from the other side ten minutes later!!!! SERIOUSLY MY FOOD WAS COLD! Never coming back at night ever. btw this was drive thru"}
{"text":"What has happened to you my wonderful go-to treat when I want to eat naughty?   Particularly this location seems far inferior to the others here in town.  It Used to be those buns had a wonderful yeasty aroma and taste, I can't recall the last time they were good like that.  In fact, last week it was so dry and hard that I took it off.  It doesn't smell like that homemade roll it once did.  My tomato was literally a ring of tomato as it had been a little too  zealously cored.  Sadly, in general, the entire burger is nothing like it Used to be.   Now what they refer to as fries... are you kidding me?  French fries have to be pretty darn bad before I'll throw them out... these are That bad.  I'd argue they were from a real potato !   Just darn disappointing how far downhill they have gone with their food.  Service however remains outstanding.  But even so, I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Coming from Hawaii, not having a In-N-Out Burger joint, we had to come here to try it out to see what the hype is about.  We found the nearest location by google mapping... apparently, theres a bunch of locations in Las Vegas.  Headed to the drive thru on a late Sunday afternoon, and boy, the line was really long.    I girl was walking up to each vehicle to take orders.  The menu is very small... about 4 different item on the menu.  We decided to order the regular and a double double burger... you have a choice of with or without onions.  On their secret menu, you can get your burgers or fries Animal Style... its basically something like a thousand island sauce. I recommend that on the French fries because the fries were nothing special by itself.  I recommend also getting the double double burger.  Its basically just another hamburger patty... the patty is small anyways so another one isn't super huge... trust me, it's better.  The burger itself isn't anything special either but it still beats White Castle burgers (which were pretty bad)."}
{"text":"Love this place and their crew. Always happy! Food was awesome. Fresh Fries!"}
{"text":"Always fast and friendly staff. Get for late night food. But popular so be prepared to wait a bit at night, can't help it."}
{"text":"Another carbon copy In-N-Out which is a good thing! The burgers are good greasy salt bombs. The grilled onions really take it to the next level. Service was fast and the facilities are clean. Qualoty is good for a low price. This place doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"I hate to leave a not so nice review but I feel like that's the only way management will know. The quality is great and so is the staff. The staff is so nice but out of the 6 times I've gone to this location 5x it's been wrong. The receipt that comes in the bag is correct but the order is always wrong. I only get a #2 sometimes an extra two burgers and something is always wrong !!! I love In-N-Out it's so frustrating to go to this location though :/!"}
{"text":"So good and so fresh. So not Corporate.   They focus on their people, great food and service. Please never go public"}
{"text":"The workers at this In-n-Out were so nice. Quick service too. This location is about a mile away from the Stratosphere so we were able to walk there."}
{"text":"This is how a business should be run. Exceptional customer service and fresh food made to order. The restaurant is always squeaky clean and employees always make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Super impressed with how fast these guys move, especially when there's a ridiculously long line.  I wanted to go here to try the vegetarian cult-classic grilled cheese and animal style fries, and was not disappointed. That said, it really was pretty analogous to Five Guys veggie sandwich, so I dunno that I'd go out of my way to get it again.  One bummer: very difficult to walk to from the strip. Make sure you are on the south side of Tropicana before attempting, and you should be ok."}
{"text":"Best fast food burger you can get, also if you want off the secret menu get the Flying Dutchman."}
{"text":"I live close to this In-N-Out, but we don't frequent fast-food burgers much,  'cuz I cook a lot and am a burger snob to boot.  BUT.... sometimes the fast route is in order. Recently, we popped through the drive through at 10p for one of those \"teenager is starving and we ate dinner 3  hours ago\" moments.  This happens frequently- we go to pick up one of our kids from some event and they are \"starving\".  My kitchen's done-closed for the night, and they luck out by getting a half-way decent drive thru burger.  And since there are a couple other people in the car, we end up picking up a variety pack so end the growling stomachs and to avoid food envy.  What is what In-N-Out is to me... a decent burger, steps above the McD's experience.  Still, not a stellar burger, but good.  Sorry folks, the fries do not amaze me.  Yes they are fresh cut potatoes but if you've ever made really good fries, you should really soak you spuds in ice water for a while to bring down the starch so that they fry up crisper.  But- the fries are OK.  Here's the \"5 star\" part:    Accurate orders- my kids order a hundred different variations, and they always get the order right.  Grilled onions- not commonly available via drive-thru  Their \"protein style\" is a lifesaver if you avoiding bread.  This is the burger wrapped in lettuce, BTW.  Ingredients that weren't processed back in New Jersey, chemicalized and trucked cross-country.  This stuff is fresh.  Food hot and fresh, service friendly.  Here's the \"2-3 star\" part:  Fries-  ehh.  Just OK  Wait- we always hafta wait in line, because they are busy.  But wait we do.  Price- every time i leave, I think \"wow, we coulda gone somewhere and sat down\" for this amount...   OK, after this review I'll assemble my short-list of good burger places!"}
{"text":"They really need more seats, they have those that are attached to the tables, so for a party of 6 that we where, we had to separate into two tables, but then there were people standing around waiting for a table they could have had, had we not needed to use 2 tables... catch 22!  Google the secret menu before going and try something new!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. I really do not understand what all the excitement is about. For 20 bucks I got 2 small greasy burgers and 2 orders of fries with a bunch of crap all over them. I walked out feeling robbed of my wallet and my health."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with my experience here, even though I visited the day after their opening when glitches are bound to occur.    There were plenty of guests, as expected, and a long line at the drive-thru.  The good folks here seem to have their act together with plenty of smiling staff members both indoors and outdoors to accommodate the anticipated crowd.  The system they used to organize cars seem to get everyone through in an even shorter amount of time as compared to some of their other locations.  The facility is brand new, clean and bright.  There are even outdoor \"ramadas\" for those who want to eat outdoors, but with some shade.  My burger was tasty and neatly packaged.  However, the fries seemed slightly under cooked.  All in all, I was happy with their organization and friendly service."}
{"text":"when you're in vegas, there's always the consoling feeling of o man...i'm hungry but just ran out of all the cash since i spent it all on vegas....  so...where do you go...for me..the answer was in n out   a california native, in n out for me is like rice to asians...wait..i am asian...XD  anyways...get the double double since i had to eat later at night as well...one is enough for the road back to LA  this place is so crowded so if you dont mind sitting with the birds and the bees outside, you probably have to eat in your car"}
{"text":"Every time I visit AZ I make sure I come here. For fast food this is my favorite. Make sure to get fries animal style."}
{"text":"The closest In-N-Out to St Louis is Dallas. So while in Phoenix ya just gotta get a couple doubles. Fav franchise burger. Fries are top 5 also."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Like usual, ordered the #1. Double Double w/ onions, fries & iced tea.  Never a bad burger at In-N-Out any where. I have been to countless restaurants. SoCal,  AZ, NV, & TX. Dreaming of one closer to STL."}
{"text":"This In-N-Out is much more convenient and not as busy as the one on Dean Martin. Minutes from the house.  And still just as good.  This allows me to pick up a double-double with well done fries on my way home after a night of dice shooting.  Animal style for the lady.   As Jason Whitlock (and not Andre W.) likes to say, the damn thangy thang gets diddy did."}
{"text":"Doing the double-double animal style.  Though I still have love for fries well done, I made the switch back to good old regular."}
{"text":"Waiting to get our burgers an fries! It's dinner,our last dinner here in Las Vegas! Hamburger is delicious- fries an a chocolate milk shake!"}
{"text":"I am from Ca and a huge fan of In n Out. This review is for the cleanliness of this particular location.   Let me start by saying that people come from around the world to Las Vegas and THIS is most divination a \"destination location\"   I have been to so many In N Outs and never seen one as dirty as this one. From the bathrooms to the tables and floors, down right dirty. In fact, if I didn't know how amazing the meal was going to be I would have looked at this as another McDonald's. Which is an insult.  In N Out is supposed to be a family owned and operated company that cares about the quality of their food and the foundation of which is was born. And yes, you are just fast food. But you're more than that. Which is why my expectations are so high. If the owner walked through this location at this time someone was for sure getting fired.   Step your game up people.   And as for BOH - great job on our burgers. Hope that kitchen is cleaner than FOH!"}
{"text":"Sweet In-N-Out.  Fantastic burgers with fresh toppings.  Mediocre fries.  A mandatory stop with any trip to Las Vegas.  Go for the double double or 3x3 and get the usual toppings but add a whole grilled onion - game-changer.  The ingredients are always fresh and delicious.  The one downside with this location is it's proximity to the Strip.  While this may make it more convenient for you to get here, it also makes it convenient for the masses to converge onto this one location during the lunch hours.  The lines can often wrap into the dining area, and seating is doggone difficult to find (pardon my language).  The service is usually pretty quick with the army of burger flippers, fry guys, and runners that they have, but it can be pretty hectic.  Unfortunately, drive-thru isn't much quicker as the line of cars often wraps around the store.  Still, if you're in Vegas, hit up the best value burger place there is!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, fries not so much, but the shakes are just like I remember from a long time ago at the Frosty Mug Drive in at my hometown.  Service is very fast!  First time here as these are not in my area yet.  A burger is hard to differentiate in fast food quality.  These guys have a great one and fairly inexpensive compared to the other chains.  Condiments were fresh.  But the one thing a person has to get is their shake.  Preferably the Strawberry ones.  So flavorful, rich and creamy.  In fact next trip, I think I'm only going to get a shake.....yummmm"}
{"text":"Quick service and excellent food! I will be back! Everything was done to standard as depicted on the menu. Had animal double-double and animal fries. I am hooked! Friendly service to boot! Thank you for a great first experience!"}
{"text":"First time eating it and had to come back for seconds at dinner time. The fries are amazing... But the ketchup is the star here!"}
{"text":"Great place right off the strip. The line was long but the lady who took our order was nice and friendly. The food was as is. There is a huge neon light up sign that covers the highway for the place that got my attention. Great little place for a taste of home!"}
{"text":"I love love love in n out but today my burger was cold probably from sitting there for 10 minutes while I drove through the drive thru line. And I ordered an Arnold palmer and I got something disgusting (see picture). It was so gross. I can't believe I am saying this but I am really disappointed with in-n-out and I wasted 6 bucks."}
{"text":"Best In and Out I have had in Arizona! I went and ordered a drink,4x4Animal style with chili, 2x2 light spread with onion, and animal fries for my linner  lunch/dinner and it tasted just as good or better than Cali In and Out. I waited in drive thru for 30 minutes and it was worth it. Burgers were cooked 100% accurately and delicious. I only recommend that they have adverts for In and Out apparel somewhere or a t-shirt display as I collect t-shirts.  Prices and service are exceptional.  I paid 16.45 for everything. I recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"I was driving around doing some errands and found this spot without Yelp by accident. This In and Out is delicious as the other location by Super Walmart. The 4x4 Animal style with chili, animal fries, and 2x2  light spread filled my need. Service is great and prices are similar to other spots."}
{"text":"This is my 1st time at a Arizona In and Out and I am impressed with wait time and food quality. It tastes different than California but I like the meat better in AZ. 4x4 with chilis was delicious as usual.  I RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"Being from the east coast, this was our first taste of an in and out burger. After hearing all the hype about the quality our expectations were probably elevated too high. While the burger was fresh and delicious. It does not compare to five guys. The fries at in and out are mediocre and very starchy and the choices of what's available are lacking (no bacon or BBQ). Compared to the slop at MC Donald's and Burger King this is much much better, but in no way can it compare to five guys. Five guys fries are 3x better and the fresh jalepenos and quality and taste of the burger and choice of bacon make five guys the better choice. That said, at this location the food was delicious and the staff were super friendly and kitchen was clean and we had a very good experience, it just does not rise to 5 star burger status"}
{"text":"I love in-n-out burger! Every time I'm on the west coast it's usually my first stop. This location had a friendly staff and the burgers and fries were great! This place was super busy, and we didn't have to wait long at all!"}
{"text":"It's In-N-Out.  Duh.  It's amazing.  I love a double double with cheese, grilled onions, special sauce with fries and a shake.  Chocolate.  :)"}
{"text":"Double Double with cheese, fries with special sauce and chocolate shake.  Heaven.  You need nothing more in life.  The Drive-Thru line is always long, so just jam out to music, wait and enjoy the best burger this side of The Mississippi!!"}
{"text":"The most popular in-n-out in the LV by far! Though there are often long lines they've figured out how to turn that into only modestly long waits. Pro tip: when you pull in head straight to see the line for drive-thru. It's not a counter clockwise rotation like most other spots. Also, there is plenty of parking (they own the building and lot next door too) so if you can't stand the wait, head on in. There will probably still be peeps in there, but at least you can fill up some ketchup cups while you wait. If you still choose to eat in your car, they give you placemats for your lap, so no worries about getting some animal sauce leakage on the pants. Speaking of animal sauce leakage, get this on everything. Fries and burger alike. Then again, you know the hype, you see the reviews, do you! A solid fast food burger awaits you any which way you order. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not busy and so far waited 20 minutes for a combo....  still waiting. Not so \" in n out\" as advertised."}
{"text":"1) for the overall In-N-Out chain, its 5 stars 2) for this specific restaurant, its 3-3.5 stars -food quality/taste: on par with other In-N-Outs -location: on major road, ample parking, drive-thru available, I walked from Palace Station casino (note this is NOT the closest location from the Strip) -staff is courteous and takes orders quickly to move lines -waiting time: maybe it was bad luck but somehow I waited 12min total for cheeseburger and fries. Numbers before and after me were being called out -dining area clean -bathrooms not so clean. floors slippery  Summary: this is a good location given its food, staff, quick lines and clean dining area. From my experience, food waiting time and bathroom cleanliness could be improved"}
{"text":"I was only out west for a few days but I made it a PRIORITY to stop here for a cheeseburger.  They need to set-up something on the east coast, immediately."}
{"text":"I'm going to say it, maybe it's because it was late I don't know! This was a very disappointing trip to In and Out Burger! I'm mean I got Animal style fries and it's like they were prepped a half hour earlier with the dressing on them that seemed to harden and cause the fries to be one huge clump! Also the double double was a bit cold and the buns were quite tough! After all that it's not sitting to well either! Very unusual I know, it's not what expected since I only get one of these meals once maybe twice a year!"}
{"text":"What is it about their burgers that keeps bringing me back? - I'm addicted. So tasty."}
{"text":"For the price and being fast food they are 5 stars. Fries are a little weird but fresh cut, clean oil. The burgers are legit not frozen.   I like the opposite of animal style, I recommend a  Double single easy spread,   One cheese is perfect.   I use the drive thru but if you want entertainment people watching inside is hilarious. Always packed full of goofs.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"now i know why everyone i know from the west coast cries a little when they find out there aren't any in-n-out burgers on the east coast. the burgers here are fresh and made to order. prices are unbeatable. definitely ask for spread to dip your fries in!!"}
{"text":"We attempted to walk to this In-N-Out (which is possible, by the way) but since we were pretty hungry (and continuing our walk involved crossing a relatively dangerous street), we hailed a taxi which took us the last quarter mile there.  The parking lot was packed with cars. Other taxis were taking folks here (and I might have seen a limo). The line was pretty long, snaking almost outside the door. Diners were eating outside as well as inside, but while waiting, we somehow managed to secure a few tables for our group. Service was going as fast as they could; there simply was an amazing mass of customers.  I ordered a 3x3 Animal Style. As usual, it was DELICIOUS (either you love In-N-Out or you don't, I fall in the former camp). One of my friends requested hot peppers and they came out in little baggies - that's the first time I've seen that at an In-N-Out, and it made my burger even better. If you like In-N-Out, this is one of the good ones, which makes everything just the way they usually do it. Recommended for a good, greasy fast food meal off the Strip, nothing more."}
{"text":"If they place has any faults I couldn't find them. Great food, service and location. Even with a big lunch crowd the staff maintained a fast pace that was met with a smile. I wish more businesses ran like this In and Out Burger. They get my highest regards."}
{"text":"I was only lucky enough to have access to In-N-Out for the two years I went to ASU. I was recently back in AZ for a visit and this was a must. I could say it's just a cheeseburger and fries but it's so much more. In my particular case, the more was \"Animal style\" everything. It's fresh, it's simple, and it cannot be replicated. This location is almost always busy but they get it done fairly quickly and with a smile! Cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"I'll pass on the \"Animal Style\", but the burgers are above average, for sure."}
{"text":"So, I finally tried this place after living in Arizona for 2 years... People out here in AZ say it's really good food for a drive thru hamburger joint.. I would agree. It is much better than McD's, Burger King, Wendy's, etc.. They only serve hamburgers, fries, drinks, and milkshakes. I guess that's why the burgers and fries they make are pretty rockin'!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out Burger is good period. The cheeseburgers were good as were the freshly made fries. My girl friend is Chinese and the Chinese dislike beef and even she enjoyed the burgers at In-N-Out Burger. My only compliant is that some asshole was able to walk in front of our car and order before that other than that In-N-Out Burger is good. Also this in In-N-Out Burger is located conveniently close to the strip, which is also a plus."}
{"text":"So I will first admit that I am a Southern Californian transplanted to Phoenix. So I am biased and I love In N Out Burgers and Fries   I order the #1 animal style. Which for those of you who don't know the secret language that is at In N Out, that is with grilled onions, lots of pickles and spread. Oh and today I learned something about the burgers being grilled with mustard. Who knew...not ME!!  Oh and I took an Newbie, an East Coast Newbie none the less today. Guess what?!?! She loved the burger...but not the fries! I really think the fries are an acquired  taste, especially if you are a McDonald's fry fanatic...All that fake beef flavoring is hard to compete with...ya know some people just like fake flavor...not the fresh cut and fresh cooked fries that are In N Out's   I get that In N Out is a regional burger place. I think that just because you don't understand the appeal doesn't mean it isn't good and has lots of people who love it...and at times CRAVE it!"}
{"text":"I usually get a single and regular fries but since I'm going back to the east coast for a while I forgot my diet (not that I really had one) and got a double double with animal style fries. No shake but I love the strawberry one! I usually hate strawberry but I'm in out has such good shakes. Now I feel like buying a Neapolitan shake...  maybe next time.  The team members were really nice so overall it's great! It's in in out so it always is  So I got the Neapolitan it's really good!"}
{"text":"Being a canuck, we are sadly missing In-N-Out Burgers.  So whenever we come down south, my boyfriend's one vice is that he needs to come here for a burger.  We've been before and have always left with happy tummies, but I was not overly impressed with our recent visit.  The burger was good, but the fries were too salty and dried up from being overcooked.  I'm sure we'll be back on our next visit, but I will probably try some other locations."}
{"text":"I love burgers and I've heard about In-N-Out good things, so I decided to try. I was there on November 29, 2017. Fries was the worst I have ever tried, dry and weird taste. Burger - nothing special, not good.  Staff was bored, I heard when one of staff was talking to another that their boss told him to go home because there was nothing to do. Not so many clients. I'm not gonna visit this place again:/"}
{"text":"Want a great burger?   Look no further!   We got double doubles and loved them.  Double cheeseburgers with everything.  Yum!   I wish we had these back on the east coast.  This place was rockin!   I think there were roughly 20 employees working in harmony in the kitchen cranking out orders at a furious pace.  The fries are fresh.  A guy is pulling down a arm on s fry cutting machine like he's mad at it!  The line was out the door but they were filling orders quicker than any other restaurant I've seen. Fantastic burgers and fry's!   The place was super clean too.  Also free little hot peppers with some real kick!"}
{"text":"Every time that I come down to LV I need to stop by IN AND OUT. There is no thing special about this place. There are the same to me. It's nice that it's next to the freeway. There fast and nice, but so are all the in and out that I have been to!!!"}
{"text":"Oh how I love thee, let me count the ways!! Fabulous burgers Always!! The animal fires are the Bomb as well! Great fresh ingredients and always friendly & fast service considering the long lines!!  Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"Always a fantastic burger!! My daughter had never had In-N-Out so a great excuse to go!! We had burgers with Animal Fries!! She was impressed with how busy they were in the Drive thru but the restaurant was clean and efficient! Our food was fresh and hot!! Not to mention Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with IN-n-Out. After hearing about this place open up recently I was wary of trying it. I assumed oh well it's on the strip it's going to be overpriced and slammed in there. Sure enough I was right about one thing. They are slammed. Surprisingly it's the same price as any other In-N-out. My boyfriend came on a Tuesday around 2 o clock this place was busy. No seats to sit inside or out but we got our food fast. Service was really great and efficient. The decor in here I love. There is a clean red and white theme with the little palm trees all over the wall and the outside is bright and neon like any good place is in Las Vegas. We got our usual two doubles with animal fries and a chocolate shake. The food was hot and fresh! My fries were nice and crispy with lots of spread. Definitely coming back to this location"}
{"text":"From Cali to Arizona  I would say.  This In and out met my standards  Good food quick.  Maybe even quicker  but can't complain.  Satisfied.  Thank you in and out"}
{"text":"My husband has been raving about this place since I met him... He could not wait to get back out to Vegas so he could take me here. Unfortunately, I didn't think it was as SPECTACULAR as he made it out to be... I mean, maybe it's because I am pregnant and burgers have not sounded good for the past 5 months. I had a bite of my husband's just to say I tried it. To me, honestly, it was a burger. The fries were good - hot and fresh but again, nothing to write home about. Their prices were really reasonable. A double-double combo was like $6.75 and my order of fries was only $1.65."}
{"text":"Good food, great customer service!  Andrew was helping me with my order today,  He is way beyond excellent and the rest of the team are great, too!"}
{"text":"Always great! Double double- animal style with no pickles and chopped chili's....mmmmmm... I think i know where i am going to lunch today!"}
{"text":"I  moved to Arizona from the Midwest recently and this was my first time eating here. The food was alright but  I have to say the line and wait was ridiculous. Obviously this is a very popular  establishment however the fact that I had to wait 20 minutes for \"fast food\"  is unbelievable. I don't know if they were short-staffed or it is always like this but quite frankly I may just go somewhere else in the future to avoid the wait"}
{"text":"Man, I so miss this burger chain living on the east coast.  I've only eaten at one In-N-Out Burger place that was slightly sub-par, and this wasn't it.  Service like at a Chik-fil-a: We were about to sit down and a guy came running over to wipe down the table and seats.  They actually brought us our food.  And the place was packed, so the employees had to be on their toes to do this across the restaurant.  And the food?  The fries are really good, but I miss the burgers so much that I eschew the fries and double down on the double double instead.  If there is a better fast food burger experience, I'm waiting to have it."}
{"text":"I don't eat any other burgers except In-N-Out and 5 Guys...and honestly, I don't even eat fast food except for those two places (sometimes I cheat by getting tots from Sonic...but rarely).  When it comes down to it, how can you subject your self to the frozen patties of other places and the low quality, yellow french fries that are oh-so-common.  I just won't stand for it...it is not worth it to me.  Go to In-N-Out burger or just don't eat fastfood.  It's pretty simple.  My standard order: # 3, Animal Style...pink lemonade with Sprite/7-Up."}
{"text":"I'd challenge you to find a more economical option on the strip. Double cheeseburger was $4 and delicious. This was our first time ever at this chain as we don't have them in any of the places we have lived. Ordering went quick. Had to wait a few minutes for the order. Fountain machines are in the dining area and refills are free (and definitely the cheapest fountain soda I could find at under $2!). Coke products-yay!!!  Located at the back of the string of shops by the High Roller at the Linq. It's a really neat area with lots to do and see."}
{"text":"For a fast food joint this place is awesome. Burgers are delicious. I'm from the Midwest so these aren't anywhere around there. When you come in get the burger and fries ANIMAL STYLE, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This location was very very busy when we came in. I've never seen a fast food place this busy. The staff was still friendly and welcoming. I noticed the manager (if not he should be) Tomas being extremely positive with the staff and very engaging with customers. As a self employed person I spend a lot of time seeking out employees. A person like Tomas is one in a million. The ketchup was out so he filled it (fast!) and brought ketchup to tables. He was mopping and cleaning tables. He always had a smile on his face. He thanked us for coming in as we left. The entire staff was polite and friendly. A good manager can create the environment for an amazing team. This whole team deserves recognition. They are doing a great job."}
{"text":"Probably the best looking meal at an in-n-out I've ever experienced.  I have been eating at this companies restaurants for the last 40 years.  The food is always good but this time it was picture perfect."}
{"text":"Food was delicious just like the in n out back home in LA. Service is fast as expected,  only down side is this location is super busy. Had to find a spot to sit down and eat. Not really a bid deal since everyone is out of there pretty fast."}
{"text":"We have been going to this location for a while and everything has been great. Last week they screwed up on an order pretty badly, which is unusual for them but I called customer service and the young lady that helped me was fantastic. They are sending out gift cards to reimburse us for our entire meal. Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, resounding great service, awesome place to stop by if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Great food here. Even when it's packed, there's always great, speedy service."}
{"text":"Well everyday is busy do I don't think that's an excuse why my fries taste very  very weird and very cold . Came thru the drive in approx around 930pm . I've been to this location before and it's never the best compared to some other ones . Well  my review probably won't mean to much here at all . Burger didn't taste right either . I think everyone is like a zombie when it comes to in & and out . Trust me I get it . Only thing taste the same was my pink lemonade drink . Well I continue to eat in and out again of course . Will I go to this location again ? Yes I will one more time just to make sure . Hey it's down the street from where I stay ."}
{"text":"I probably go here every 6 mos. or so if I'm with a meat eater that is and they have to have In N Out the grilled cheese is consistently good and my kid likes em too, along with the fries that sometimes come w/ a fish taste at no extra charge!! Chocolate shakes are always fun though and most everyone I go with regrets eating the burgers afterwards though they say \"Dude that was a good call you had a grilled cheese huhuhuhuuuh I dont feel too great.\" I'm not big on onions so the animal style stuff doesnt do it for me either sorry folks.   I remember when In N Out came to town GOOD WORD you couldnt even get into the damn place they would have cones up in the parking lot with cops directing traffic. I think its way overrated but they pay the kids that work here more than minimum wage and well the meat eaters need to eat still right!?!"}
{"text":"Coming from someone who lives in the East Coast and completely devoid of In-N-Out. On our trip to Las Vegas, we had to stop at In and Out.   The staff are real friendly. Food is simply amazing for fast food. The burger is truly the best in terms of quality and value. The burgers are made fresh and never frozen, which is the best part. Then get the Animal Style Fries.   Thank you for having great fast food and please come to the EAST COAST!"}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum! In-N-Out, I am from the East Coast a place you do not visit for some odd reason! Let say, I am a huge fan! This place has staff that are very nice, helpful and welcoming along with amazing quality food for amazing values.   For lunch today: I order 3 double-double , 2 cheese burger, 1 hamburger and 2 animal fries. The total came out to around $25.24. This is my second location for this establishment and it is very consistent in my opinion. The only thing that can vary might be wait time since it usually packed and staff at different location.   Hint: If you are about to order plain french fries ask for Animal Style Fries. It a secret but the people working will understand what you are talking about!"}
{"text":"How could you cross the country and NOT eat In-N-Out.  It can change your LIFE   Best run burger joint I ever went to  and very clean   Service is top notch   Oh!!  Did I mention the burgers"}
{"text":"Referred to us to try from a relative that visited a shop in California and loves them, we thought we would give it a try. We checked an app on my phone and found one close to us when we were out and about on the Strip. It was a rainy night and we were coming back from a late show and weren't sure what to eat.  They have a rope at the front door with two door man making sure that the place didn't get over run with customers. We were let in right away.  It was a small shop with not very many indoor seating available. I was lucky to find a table. They have a cleaning crew that does nothing but clean the floors, counters and tables. The turnover is huge. The cleaner was friendly, outgoing and a joy to converse with. It make the experience pleasant. The food is a bit pricey but everyone seems to love it. You're on the strip and people will pay that price. There was a long line to order and receive the food, but it seemed to move quickly.  The Cheeseburger was good, but nothing outstanding about it. I am glad I tried it, but I don't think I will again."}
{"text":"Nothing can ever be wrong with In n Out. The only thing that comes to mind is the long drive thrus, but once I taste the awesomeness that is In n Out, I don't care that I've waited 30 mins to get my food."}
{"text":"Ok this is the place I love to go to when I'm missing home (Southern California)  I'm so happy Las Vegas has an In-N-Out burger . Every time I come I always get the same old thing, a double double  burger  , fries and a strawberry shake and my wife pretty much gets the same. I know there is a whole secret menu but honestly I when it come to this place I like to keep it simple. But there is one thing I always do that I wouldn't normally do anywhere else. I put a lot of pepper in my ketchup  does anyone else do that?  The service is always fast and friendly. No matter what time we go it's always packed but I honestly don't mind it's like that at all In-N-Outs ? and oddly makes me feel more nostalgic"}
{"text":"So, living close to this place, I always smell the goodness coming from this place. It's sooo tempting and is so good. My go to burger is the 3x3, animal style. If you are watching your carbs, try the burger \"protein style\". It'll rock your world.   Service is hit or miss. I probably go to this place 4-5 times a month and it's roll of the dice every time. When they do screw up, they are quick to fix and very apologetic. No one is perfect but the food makes it all worthwhile."}
{"text":"Perfect late night eatery.  Definitely feeling the vibe of a midnight run for a double double with crispy fried and a milkshake. Love that there are always around 15 other like minded individuals waiting when I get here and the staff is always able to bang it out with smiles and ease! Keep it up. A must go for any east coaster."}
{"text":"First time here! Walked from MGM Grand on Tropicana, go under the freeway and go right! A short walk to Dean Martin, cross the street and another crosswalk any you're here!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way out of Vegas to the airport because my boyfriend says \"it's not a trip to Vegas id you don't get In-N-Out Burger.\"  I had a regular cheesburger and I must say it was above average for a fast food joint.  The sauce they add (which is probably just ketchup and mustard) lol, along with the fresh toppings is what makes this place stand out from your average run of the mill burger drive thru.  It was the end if the trip so we needed a good calorie filled meal before the long flight back home!"}
{"text":"Came to this location with a friend and we had an enjoyable lunch. We placed our order, got our drinks, and were on a quest for a table, and a gentleman offered us his as he was leaving. The table had barely been used and was still clean, so we seized the opportunity. The place was packed, as it was lunchtime, but within 5-7 minutes, we had our food, hot and fresh.   I had my usual, the #3 combo and shared my fries with my friend. She had a burger and asked for grilled onions, only without the secret sauce...slightly Animal Style perhaps...and a milkshake to go with. Our food was just the way we like it and we ate and caught up on things with one another. We were no sooner done and one of the workers asked if he could take our tray and trash away. Talk about efficient service! They are on the ball with cleanup as well.   I love this location, being it's not all that far from home. I can never say no ti In-N-Out Burger...it's a longtime fave and each time family members of mine visit from out of state, we make it a point to go there since they are fans as well."}
{"text":"Best burger around, but then I am favoritist to this place for a reason. Pricewise, they are decent and you actually get a combo, as opposed to Smashburger and Five Guys where their items are ala carte, hence you spend more money.   I am not a fan of cheese on hamburgers (yes, I know...I am WEIRD), therefore I order the #3 combo. Once in a while, I will either get the burger or the fries done Animal Style. Sometimes I will get a Strawberry Shake instead of a soda too. Their shakes are really good and hit the spot when it comes to sweetness for me. Usually it's the ice cold Diet Coke that lures me though. The only drawback for me is that they don't have Coke Zero. Coke Zero is my absolute drink of drinks and if it isn't offered, I resort to Diet Coke or once in a very blue moon, regular Coke or Dr. Pepper.  The service is pretty good although if it's super busy there may be a bit of a wait, but well worth it by the time you get your meal."}
{"text":"A damn fine $3.00 burger and the shake will soothe your losses at the tables.  For my taste this is identical in every way to Five Guys but, In-n-out costs less.  Note:  They have the coolest, Las Vegas-style, huge neon, flashing sign. Note 2: The lines are notorious at this location.  Expect 10, 20, 30 + minutes at anytime day or night."}
{"text":"On an extended visit to AZ, I am lucky enough to be staying only a couple miles from this particular In-N-Out location. Yes, the parking lot is difficult to get into. Yes, there is often a wait. Even so, it's been my Friday night indulgence for the past month now. Even with a line of cars stretching far into the parking lot, the wait is never more than 10 minutes.  Why is In-N-Out Burger so good? I'd wager there's a secret narcotic they put in the sauce. I love that they have someone in the parking lot to take orders and transmit them wirelessly to minimize wait time. I love how pleasant all their staff is. I love how clean the place is. Have I mentioned how much I love this place?  I'll take their simple menu of a few things they do really well over an extensive menu of mediocrity any day. I've been known to plan road trips and stops around In-N-Out, so maybe I'm biased. I just wish there was a location (or several) in Seattle. One can dream, right?"}
{"text":"I remember when In N Out used to have awesome THICK cut fries that were just perfect. The burgers had a really soft bun and the juicy patties were well-seasoned. They used to be worth 5 stars.  I'm really disappointed that it's all changed. I am not sure if they stayed the same in Cali, but it'd be great if they did. Here in Vegas, The fries are really thin and SPONGY. The burgers have buns that are shiny.. oily, greasy, soggy.. It's really unpleasant. Patties are not seasoned like they used to be so it's not much of an improvement over a salad. The 10-15 minute wait is usual for dine-in. I've eaten at this location 4 times and I'm sad to say the food doesn't represent the In N Out I used to love.  I noticed this is a favorite burger joint for a lot of people, and I'm really surprised. If only you had In N Out when they actually served great food. Maybe it's still the same in Cali. Maybe not. I don't care anymore."}
{"text":"I have always heard how good this place is so today I came and visited the restaurant. People must love this place as its busy but I don't see why. Burgers were typical burgers and fries were blah. They messed up the whole order and had to redo it.. Then they overcharged and it wasn't just me. I just am not impressed for the price of what it costs and the basic food choices. I thought it would be better but it's not. Again a lot of people like this place but I sure don't"}
{"text":"My first In-N-Out experience! One of the things I was most excited about trying during my west coast visit was In-N-Out.  I loved it so much I stopped by on two separate occasions. :) The animal style burger was amazing. I'm not a huge fan of the fries but those burgers hit the spot every time!"}
{"text":"Heck yes, IN-N-OUT has it down. No matter where I go, either here or any location in CA or AZ or here in town, this place knocks it out of the park.   Ordered a double double with no lettuce, tomato, or onion, but added grilled onions for no cost (basically the way to get it animal style, without saying animal style) :) Also got the fries animal style, yes I know, let's have a few calories today for lunch ehh? Walked right up to the counter at about 1:45 yesterday, (5/20) and the kid was quick at the register, got everything right, and the price I think was in the $8.50 range.   This location isn't the closest to me in town, but when I'm cruising down the 215 or in the st. rose and eastern intersection area sometimes I'll hop over to this location and knock out a double double (this location as most of you will know is just seconds off the 215 and Eastern exit, on the east side of the street)   I got an unusual amount of fries this time, not real sure why but they were awesome, it took me a long damn time to polish these off, but man they always have the perfect crispiness and you know they're fresh. You can see the guy (or girl) shredding these fat potatoes right in front of you, then straight into the fryer less than a couple minutes later.   5 stars, not sure when or if I'll ever be able to give in-n-out any less, We shall see!!"}
{"text":"Oh in-n-out. How do I love thee?? Moving to Vegas 5 years ago from small town Kansas I had never tried In-n-Out before. First I didn't even know what it was, now I eat here every chance I get. And for good reason. The consistency of the burgers are always spot on, they've really got this assembly line thing down!!! Almost always I order my burger with grilled onions, and I always get animal style on the fries. The fries are cut fresh from huge potatoes, you can watch them smash and string the potatoes right before they throw them in the fryer and serve them to you. The burger always has a little crispiness to the bun and the cheese drips out of the burger as you eat it. MY KIND OF BURGER!!!! Luckily I've always had a fast metabolism and can eat about whatever I want and stay pretty lean and it's a good thing! There's plenty of calories in this meal! Quality of service, friendliness of the cashier, deliciousness consistency of the meal, and reasonableness (is that a word?) of the price will give it a remarkable 5 STARS! Thanks In-N-Out. I'll see ya soon...."}
{"text":"Subpar, the fries ruined it, as they tasted a bit sponge like. Burgers were good but messy though. The staff were very pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"What can I say that everybody hasn't! Great food great service and great location ! This is where I go when I want to feed my need for awesome burgers and animal fries !!! They put something in the food to make you crave it lol ! Do yourself a favor and eat at in n out!"}
{"text":"It's a good burger. They're open late. It's cheap.  I've had In-N-Out a few times and it's never been the religious experience other people seem to have at this place.   I just don't know what I'm missing. I love a good burger...trust me on that one. In-N-Out has just never floored me the way it does some people.   So, once again, in conclusion:  It's a good burger. They're open late. It's cheap."}
{"text":"This In-N-Out was the location of our post-Las Vegas Rock 'n' Roll Marathon celebration meal. We ate here because every place else inside the casinos was either closed or imposed a 1-2 wait time. By 11:30 p.m. I could have chomped on my own two feet for all I cared - I was starving! Plus after running 26.2 miles, they (my feet) were as good as useless anyway.  Luckily I did not have to consume any appendages; and it was a relief to see that the line inside In-N-Out was only semi-ridiculously long compared to the restaurants along the Strip. I couldn't have been more satisfied with my hamburger, fries, and chocolate shake. My fiance was very happy with his Double-Double, cheeseburger, and Animal Fries.  Thanks, In-N-Out for helping us end our race on a positive note!"}
{"text":"Flat Out The BEST Burger for the Price$. There is no chain that even comes close. When I fly into Vegas or Ca., this is a must. There Is No Better"}
{"text":"Went to this place b/c my husband heard that the burgers were all that. Personally, I didn't think much of it. I was initially turned off by all of the pigeons walking around on the tables and there was a lizard on another table, so we chose to eat inside. To my surprise, the menu only has double-double,  cheeseburger, hamburger and fries. They have the basic strawberry, chocolate and vanilla shakes. I had a chocolate that was ok. The fries tasted like they had been cooked in a dehydrator as they were a bit dry and the burger patty was so thin that I ended up with quite a bit of bun left as the meat was not only skinny, it didn't cover the full width of the bun. I was a little disappointed with this place after all of the other food places that we visited during our Vegas vacation. I don't think we will go back..."}
{"text":"Late night, watching the diet, quick restaurant that's safe and friendly; that's why we're at In-and-Out!!  We got 2 protein style burgers (each) and I cheated with an order of some fries. This place is always clean, well lit, friendly and delicious. Highly recommended when the choices get complicated and the hunger is overwhelming. Don't hesitate to commit and just make the decision. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Average In-N-Out. The burgers are not amazing' I don't quite understand the hype, but always friendly service and quick."}
{"text":"I'll give In and Out a 5 star rating any day of the week, but in Vegas - where  I would rather gnaw off my arm than pay $300 for dinner -- this burger joint is especially welcome. Yes, it's cheap and it's fast food, but when you're drunk nothing is better. It closes at 1:30am on Friday so don't bother showing up at 5am thinking you can score a burger and shake. It's just not going to happen.   A personal tale: Leaving the ghostbar one night, the luminous In-and-Out sign called out our names so we grabbed a taxi. When we arrived, ravenous from the images of double-doubles dancing in our heads, we started to pay the driver. He said \"no, no. I'll wait for you\". No joke, he turned off the meter and just chilled while we got our food. Because of his generous nature, we brought him back a #1. It was only right.   I also spent the rest of the night looking like a homeless youth because of the massive grease stains on my shirt from where the double double got a little too rowdy. Only in Vegas? Probably not."}
{"text":"Overall Inn n Out never disappoints. The burgers are delicious, fresh and the cheese always perfectly melted. The lettuce has a crunch and the tomatoes aren't mealy. Things you would think would be expected of most places that serve burgers, but often these goals aren't met - except for Inn n Out. Quality burgers. All the time."}
{"text":"What can I say - I'm a meat eater. I first tried In-N-Out in San Francisco in 2004. I'm originally from the Midwest and I think I can generally say that there aren't many burgers that live up to the hype In-N-Out has.  I really like their chocolate shakes and I almost always get my burger Animal Style. My boyfriend and I have also discovered that we like the fries a lot better if we get them lightly well done.  Just as most people suggest - try something off the not so secret menu."}
{"text":"There are trailers around here, so work that pays $13 bucks an hour for flipping burgers and slicing up potatoes is very much appreciated.  They love their jobs.  They have a smile and a cheery hello with every customer.  It is almost like they are given a prozac when they arrive for their shift.  Whatever it is that makes them happy, it will make you happy as a customer.  As I've mentioned in one of the other In-N-Out reviews, make sure to acquaint yourself with the \"secret menu\" on the website.  Have something animal style.  Have some well done fries.  Try something new and live on the edge, you risk taker heartbreaker.  Note:  The American Express lunch crew decends on this place like an invading army.  Avoid around the noon hour unless you don't mind waiting.  Very likely to be the best burger in town.  If you don't leave town, it is likely to be the best burger in your life!"}
{"text":"Adrian, I hate to say it, but you fail at burgers.  I'm going to have to report you to the burger authorities for disciplinary burger action.  This location is stocked with suburban teens, so they don't really like to work too hard.  It takes away valuable time from sharing the url to their myspace profile, taking pictures of their emo hair in the in-n-out bathroom mirrors to post on their myspace profiles, talking to any hot girl/boy that comes in, etc.    You'll get your food eventually, and when you do, it'll be the best you can expect from a burger experience.  If that's not what happened, you failed to order correctly.  I suggest remedial study of the In-N-Out website for access to the secret menu options."}
{"text":"In Scottsdale, only the whitest most purebred and pedigreed children of a 50s sitcom are kept on staff here to fetch the trophy wives driving their escalades and hummers on ten thousand dollar rims hamburgers that they're just going to puke up later.  It's too bad, because it's not that bad of food considering.  The meat comes from special farms and is never frozen.  There are no freezers even in the stores.  It is better food than most people eat in this town.  I've seen what you buy in the grocery stores.  I'm shocked you had the energy to carry your things out to your car.  Okay.  Maybe I'm exaggerating a little.  The fact of the matter is that the food here isn't put together as well as some of the other more working-class neighborhood locations, but is still some of the best fast food you can lay your hands on."}
{"text":"I prefer my beef like I like my men, rich and meaty! And that's definitely what I got here at this famous burger joint. Oh my and animal style is the only way to go for some incredible seasonings and lots of condiments/toppings. I repeat, animal style is the only way you want your cheeseburger fixed! Have no fear your won't find lettuce here to take away from the savory goodness of the rich meat and cheese.  The fries tasted healthier because they were freshly cut with the skin still on them. Personally I like greasy soggy fries but if you need some excuse to think you're eating healthy then they would be the reason.   Drive through lady was nice as she tried to share this special recipe that they have their for the lemonade tea. Not really sure so you'll have to ask what she was talking about. I was too distracted by the aroma of the food.   Damn it, now I'll have to find another excuse to get to the West coast ASAP for one of the best burgers I've ever had."}
{"text":"I have never had In-N-Out, so I would rate a 5 on food and a 1 on location, so I will even it out to a 3. The menu compared to other fast foods is pretty limited, and even their combos are just an easier way to order (as in, there's no discount to ordering a combo vs. ordering parts individually.)  The place was packed, which is why I am not a huge fan of this location. I'm going to guess that it's hard to find cheap eats on the Strip, so that's why the situation. There was just a huge line to order, a while to wait, a number system that didn't seem to be in any order so you really had to pay attention, and no where to sit. I will give them credit, that they did a pretty good job keeping things moving, all things considered. I just personally don't like being in big crowds and then eating standing up because that's my only option.  The burger was nice and juicy and lettuce and tomato provided the perfect contrast. The fries were great, described by my boyfriend as \"too salty\" but I say there's no such thing. Is it worth all the hassle of getting the food? Ehh I'm glad I tried it but brace yourself if you come here. I would be more than happy to visit another INO when I am somewhere else on the west coast, provided they are calmer."}
{"text":"Incredibly quick and friendly service, even at a crazy-busy time. Fresh ingredients, made to order, and it was delicious! Even if you just get a grilled cheese and fries, it's a great spot!  My husband has loved In N Out since his omnivorous days - the fresh ingredients really make the food delicious! Now that he's pescetarian, he still loves to stop in for a grilled cheese, fries and a shake after a night out.  The service is always wonderful, but last night, it was even more impressive because the line at the drive-thru went around the block and the place was  packed to the gills.   And they were really quick! We could see them making everything fresh, putting the orders together, and we still got out food as quickly as any other fast food place."}
{"text":"It's In N Out we all love it but I don't understand why people will wait 20 minutes for some In N Out. The place is always packed and during lunch and dinner hours, there's always like 12 cars lined up in the drive thru. They have to send a person out to the line, which now reaches the parking lot, to take orders, but they make one thing in 3 variations, but each order will at least have the bun, a burger patty, and the lettuce and tomato. Why aren't they just throwing a bunch of pattys on the fryer and setting up at least a one patty burger during that time?     I don't understand why I can go to a Chinese restaurant, order three different dishes, out of a menu of about 50 or so different items, and get all of that faster than it would to get a burger in a place that sells one thing in three variations. Screw people and they're \"Animal Style\" or the idiots that want to do a 10 by 10. Now they're just playing with food. Eat your damn burger and be happy.         In conclusion, my cravings for In N Out have never been powerful enough to want to wait for 20 minutes in a crowded, noisy, kids running everywhere place where the line at the drive thru is so long that if you put your car in reverse, you'll be in the drive thru line for KFC. Just don't go there during the lunch rush. Especially if you're on lunch because you won't make it back in time. Even if you worked at that In N Out, you won't make it back in time from lunch.      I could go for some In N Out right now though."}
{"text":"Real burgers so damn good the way fast food should be !!! Would recommend this to anyone just moved to aj az from Chicago they need these out there and not a damn Mikey d's on every corner"}
{"text":"Writing this review around lunch time and its making my mouth water and day dream of more In-N-Out! The menu is simple burger, fries, and shakes. No crazy combos or an endless list to chose from.  Except for you can add the secret menu into the mix.  Im from Texas where sadly there is no In-N-Out and even I know of the delicious secret menu! I always order my fries animal style!  Honestly, I wouldn't eat the fries if they weren't animal style, only because their fries are not super crispy like I usually like my fries.   With that being said, all there food is amazing and its all made fresh.    Yes, this location does tend to get busy, but they keep the line moving surprisingly really fast. No worries... In-N-Out will be in your tummy soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious as always... cheap good food! Spectacular service!"}
{"text":"Our friends told us that we needed to visit this place while we were in Vegas or AZ. I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not a person who loves Sonic & I thought that's what this place was going to be like, but it absolutely was not. This place was very fresh. I had just a cheeseburger & fries & I was shocked at how good it was. The fries were so delicious. This is by far the best fast food place I've ever been to & one needs to come to NY ASAP!"}
{"text":"told these bastards at least 5 times i wanted spread on my fries and got none. happened last time i came too f this location"}
{"text":"Delicious as usual, but this location is way super packed!  And can be a warzone to exit the parking lot back onto Tropicana."}
{"text":"This is my favorite In N Out to go to. Service is always fast and staff is super friendly. My order stays the same for ever haha. Grilled cheese (Contains no meat) with onion, chopped chilly and a side of fries. Total comes out to $4.11, you cannot beat that."}
{"text":"First of all, their chocolate shakes are too good! I always get a small so I don't over do it.  What I find weird is they don't accept Discover Credit Cards.    Their animal style burgers are by far the best and only fast food burger I will dare to eat. Meat is fresh, not that nasty freezer crap they let bake under a light while the employees contaminate them with dirty hands.  Also, the people at this location are so friendly. A smile really does go a long way people!"}
{"text":"First time trying it to see if it lives up to the hype and it does! I had my burger animal style which is highly recommend by everyone. I forgot to do my fries animal style but next time I will for sure! The food came out quick and the staff was very friendly"}
{"text":"Always a good double double no lettuce with grilled onions. Shared fries & drink. Those little chili's are really good with a burger. Today was fast service. Yummy"}
{"text":"This was my first In-N-Out experience and I unfortunately wont get many more since I live on the east cost, but the burgers were really good!  I would suggest going animal style but only on the fries because they were quite dry without the sauces. The quality of the burger is evident with your first bite.  As far as price goes you really cant beat it compared to other food you will find in Vegas, butttt you better be ready for a wait.  We went for lunch and it was packed out.  We ended up waiting for the 25 minutes in line and then having to sit outside the restaurant near the fountain."}
{"text":"Visited here a couple weeks ago to get our fix while visiting family. Service was great. Girl behind the counter didn't even flinch when I spouted off my unusual order (4x4, animal style, whole grilled onion, and chopped chiles + animal style fries, well done). Order came out promptly and exactly how we ordered it. Love some In-n-Out."}
{"text":"If anything, I'm very impressed with the customer service of In-N-Out Burger.  Compared to other fast food places, In-N-Out is by far the best when it comes to providing a family friendly and customer focused atmosphere.  Burgers are great, but surprisingly their fries are disappointing.  Not really sure why as they are fresh cut.  But even fresh, the fries have a dry texture to them, nowhere near as good as McDonalds.  Also, unless you REALLY like onions, don't ask for onions.  They literally give you a full slice of onion, which is a bit much for me.  But otherwise, great place for a burger!"}
{"text":"The line was long, but it went pretty quick.  I've only had In-N-Out once before, the burger was really great but the fries were awful. Very bland, zero seasoning and not crispy at all.  So I wouldn't repeat the fries but I would definitely get the burger again."}
{"text":"Love the slim and salty patties. The fries are so so. Because of that I'd give them 4 out of 5 stars, but the burgers are so darned good that they deserve a 6 star rating."}
{"text":"Great Burgers and fries.... Great. I had a double double.... But did it beat shake shack in comparison of burgers alone? IDK. Maybe as a whole IN and Out is the winner but I just dont know if this is the king of all burger shops as many claim... I have been to Alot of different Burger places and eaten alot of burgers (shake shack NYC, IN AND OUT, Fatburger) Most of the big names have gone into and out of my belly... ANd I can honestly say In and OUt is good... Real Good... The Best ???? Idk."}
{"text":"I feel like it's wrong to give this less than five stars. I'm sorry, In-N-Out, it's me not you. I think I just wasn't overwhelmed with joy the way others are at the prospect of an animal style burger. I prefer a more meaty patty and crunchier fries."}
{"text":"This place was a zoo.  They have one of the worst drive thru set ups in my opinion.  Anyways the line was too long so I went in.  They workers are like a fine tuned machine.  They have the process down.  One makes the burger, another person adds the fries, another makes the drinks.  It went really quickly.  We had a lot of custom burgers and they got our order correct despite it.    Only complaint is the fries were cold and soggy by the time we made it home 10 minutes later.  If you get fries you better dine in."}
{"text":"This is my favorite location.  Clean,  fresh & hot food ready in minutes. They have cash back on bank amerideals (Bank of America)."}
{"text":"Come on guys it's In-N-Out Burger!Same quality burgers from So Cal to Texas. Shakes to die for and FRESH"}
{"text":"Everything you'd expect and you've heard about In-N-Out. Outstanding staff who are very fast, friendly and attentive, my order is always right and the food is always outstanding. Fresh beef patties and potatoes cut for your fries specific to your order. There's always a long line, but they do a great job getting people in-n-out!"}
{"text":"I don't normally review fast good places because I don't expect much. BUT I do expect more from In-N-Out. Food is always good and fresh! But customer service is hit or miss. It's right by my office so I go a couple times a month and sometimes customer service is excellent other times not so much. Try to miss the lunch rush during the week by going before noon or after 1pm."}
{"text":"Double Animal Style! Along with a side of animal style fries and a strawberry milkshake seem to be the only thing I ever order because my taste buds just burst with so much joy! In-N-Out Burger most definitely have some of the FRESHEST burgers you can eat! That's hard to find in most fast food places! Plus they are super addicting!"}
{"text":"Food is always awesome from this location and we are always happy to come here.  Love their food.    As a recommendation: get a flying dutchman (two patties and cheese - that's it) and animal style fries.  cut up and mix both of these together and they are amazing."}
{"text":"I like this location it's off the main road so not a lot of traffic but still does get quite busy and the food is always good. I have not had a bad experience at this location and I been here a lot. Plus the staff is always friendly and full of smiles. Definitely recommend this location if you looking for a place close by."}
{"text":"Ok, so first things first, this is a pontless review, I mean you most likely have your opinions set already, but if like me, you move Westward and have always heard of the mythical in-N-out, I figure this might be of use to you. A) it's a chain fast food joint. So set your expectations there. Do I have a favorite burger place? Yes. Is it a fast food joint? Why no, no it's not. Neither is it this FAST (hence the name fast food eh?) or hve a drive through, or so handy after a long day dragon slaying and I just want to get back to my cave and prop my feet up. So lets dispense with the silliness, this place is what it is, it's cheap, surprisingly cheap, fast... usually VERY fast (unless there's a hella rush) Service so friendly that it's almost scary!   As for the food, the meat is decent quality for a chain and fresh, not frozen. tasteless lettuce fresh and crispy for texture, and onions either grilled or fresh cut, your choice. Now to what I tend to order... yeah they have a secret menu, and I've played with it a bit, but I only tend to go when tired and haven't planned in advance, and since I don't care enough to memorize the secret menu, all i know is \"animal style\" which isn't bad at all, adds a bit of flavor and messiness to the burger, although I only had it the once. The buns are fresh, as are the fries, so i find that they benefit from extra toasting, order them both \"well done\" I find that especially for the fries, it makes a world of difference. The well done fries are much better than the usual ones.More texture and crunch etc... As for the burger, i like fresh onions, so add lots of those, and they have never let me down.   To the people that view the animal style fries as gross because of the way they \"look'? So what? How do they taste? and if it just wasnt for you, then fine, but I have never had them myself, and cant imagine I would ever order them because they looked good (or good for you!) I mean figure out the ingredients, art for the eyes was never the point! I want to try the animal fries myself, i just haven't.   If my fast options are Chick-Fi-Lay/Panda Garden/In-N-Out/Hardee's (Carl's JR out here)I would probably go for one of the burger joints, with the awareness that the entire meal at In-N-Out would cost what the burger at Carl's costs, but sometimes I don't go for cheap, and some Carls are decent.)  But as long as your expectations are reasonable, your not gonna be disappointed by the In-N-Out food.Even if it isn't what you like, its good stuff for what it sets out to be.  Might try that DQ burger a earlier review mentioned if the situation arrives."}
{"text":"In-N-Out Whaaaattt?! I have these crazy cravings for In-N-Out every once in a while and that's because ummm who doesn't love a fresh to made order burger?! This particular night I decided to try the UNLV location out! I was in a brave mood and went ahead and ordered a 4x4 \"Animal Style\" with the \"Animal Style\" fries! Yikes I know I know it's a ZILLION calories lmafo! It's not something that is on the actual menu board so for those of you who are looking at the menu wondering what the hell I am talking about. Its an \"ask me\" kind of order. Either way I believe they will make pretty much whatever you want as long as they have the ingredients to do so. The customer service was spot on. When we pulled thru the drive thru it was moving QUICK! This is something that most people complain about but for IN-N-Out it's sooo worth it! The girl taking orders was so happy and it just made you even more excited about your food. Great food, Great Service and Fast execution of your order gets you a FIVE SHINY STAR Rating Whoot WhooT!"}
{"text":"My old friends favorite burger in the world so I had to try it even if meant risking my life crossing the highway. Very good I must say. I like the small chillies. I would say that Shake Shack do a better pattie while In n Out have a much nicer bun. All in all very good."}
{"text":"What an eventful evening lol so.. something fun happened because I pulled in with 4 other cop cars and they decided to block me out of the drive through. What terrible customer service!! Haha just kidding So I pull into a parking space and apparently run over a soda bottle that I didn't see and it exploded, but luckily the bottle cap hit a tree and bounced off of the tree and hit my car..... yaaaaaaay... anyways..  The staff was very friendly and helpful on decisions for my co workers who ordered burgers with unnecessary amounts of Patty's. I however opted for the fries. Which were not bad with a dash of salt and a river of ketchup, but I'd imagine a chewing on anything drowned in ketchup cant taste that bad so.. average. The group that I came with said all of their burgers were great... as they were falling asleep  at the table lol The action with the cops, the exploding soda bottle and the now half asleep crew that I'm driving back to work.. I'd like to declare in-n-out the late night battleground of Las Vegas. Quite the experience. Look forward to another late night shift :)  ...Actual Yelp review? Or rant?...  Same same-"}
{"text":"Living in Southern California, we have In N Outs all over the place around here, so the experience is nothing new to me, though I tend not to frequent them too often. I stopped at this location on a recent drive home from Colorado and was amazed at the massive amount of people inside the restaurant. Now, In N Outs are generally busy at all times of day & night, with at least 5-6 cars or more in the drive-thru at any given moment. But nothing I've ever seen even compares to the sheer number of folks inside this particular In N Out, waiting to get their burger on.   It was a Wednesday, around lunch time, and I got a regular cheeseburger, grilled cheese, fries and soda. The wait to get my food was only about 5-7 minutes which I thought was nothing short of amazing given the mass of humanity surrounding me on all sides at all times. Eating side wasn't an option (even for a party of 2) because there just wasn't any place to sit down, so we ate outside in the shade (in 100+ degree heat, but it's a dry heat!). Good food, good times."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews (and being from the East Coast), we needed to try In-N-Out Burger on our recent trip to Vegas.  I will give it to you guys - it's a good burger, but people seem to go insane for these things!! LOL. Fries are good too. An average fast food chain. Quick and dirty - more emphasis on the 'dirty'.  A note to the guy at the Drive-Thru Window: when you ask someone if they want ketchup, and, they reply 'no thank-you' - DO NOT stare at them blankly for 10 seconds like they're from another planet.  I guess you really like ketchup - don't you buddy - LMAO!!  If you've never tried, go for it, but, don't go too far out of your way. A hamburger is a hamburger......"}
{"text":"This is the best fast food burger fresh and good nothing to complain about even I have to wait cuz this place always pack."}
{"text":"Why bother writing a review about this place - it's very clearly and indisputably a 5 for no other reason than quality taste, perfect pricing, great service, and consistency among all locations. It is by far one of the only fast food restaurants I am happy giving a 5 for. Haters and some East Coasters may never understand, but West Coast folks do."}
{"text":"Amazing!I love this food. The line was long, but no problem it went down fast.The customer service is excellent.Definitely recommmend this place.Been to other in-n-out's and service was day and night in comparison to this service!"}
{"text":"I love In N Out! This locations always gets our orders correct and the drive through is pretty fast."}
{"text":"SUCH an in n out fan, but just a heads up to other in n out lovers, this location sucks! My second time here and the line is always short but for some reason I'm sitting in the drive through for 20 minutes. The person taking my order also had to ask me 4 TIMES what it was and I got two burgers."}
{"text":"Looong drive thru line around 1pm but Javier stood outside taking orders. Once we arrived at the first window to pay our order was one fry too many so we had to wait for a manager to take that item off of our order but other than that Tamara was was sweet enough to make us aware of the wait. We paid and was out of there in less than 10 minutes!"}
{"text":"Love, Love their burgers, fresh fries are awesome and the yellow peppers... My mouth is watering just writing this."}
{"text":"I love the quickness and love the fresh food they use. Grilled onions mmm so good. Please come to Denver."}
{"text":"a great stop in point for a quick burger and fries especially late night! locations are always busy it seems however its a quick \"in and out\" for a burger. Great sauce as well, no mustard/ketchup/pickle offered on the burgers, but since there are not any In-N-Out Burgers in Ohio, its always glad to try something new. Surely we will be back!"}
{"text":"Where's the Beef?  My hamburger ran out meat with over 50% of my bun left. This is not acceptable!"}
{"text":"YUM!. Visiting Las Vegas, so we HAD to make a pit stop here. Drive thru was pretty quick. Burgers and fries were DE-LICIOUS! Wish there was an In-N-Out Burger, here in Florida. My mouth is watering! *sigh*"}
{"text":"Ok, go ahead and tar and feather me, but I must tell it like it was for us on this trip.  We just returned to Texas after a two week trip to Vegas.  This particular In-N-Out Burger has a sign right next to I15 that reaches to the sky which calls many autos off the freeway.  It also got to us as we headed to our hotel!  First, it was so crowded that we should have taken our clue from that.  The line to order went all through the entire restaurant and there was not a clean table in the place.  My husband got in line and I finally found a table someone was abandoning and claimed it for us.  In a corner just for two.  When my husband finally arrived I was thrilled to see the burgers, fries, and drinks, as In-N-Out is my favorite burger joint in Vegas and CA.  Well, one bite and I had wished we were at Jack-in-the-Box!  Very small piece of meat, dried out, and just awful!  Fries?  I don't even know how to describe them.  Needless to say, this ruined our going to another In-N-Out the entire trip.  Usually we make 2-3 runs to one when we are in Vegas, as TX's has none.  I guess they don't have to be so up-to-par as the others since most of their business comes from the freeway and the stip.  Next time it's out to the \"regular\" neighborhoods for a good In-N-Out Burger!"}
{"text":"Good Food! Fast! Open Late !!!  Very clean location ! Fast service"}
{"text":"On my low carb kick so no fries but I did have to get a protein style burger. One burger not enough and had to get another but for $2.58 why not. So good. Maybe next time I'll just get a double. As always this location was busy. But service was quick and I was able to get a table  woohoo"}
{"text":"These burgers are incredible. I'm a New Yorker and love shake shack, but In and Out is on a league of its own. I love the Double, double."}
{"text":"I am so stoked to finally have an In N Out nearby! I went with my dad at lunch time the 2nd day they were open. It was super busy, but the line moved very quiclkly. We ordered 4 cheeseburgers, animal fries, and a regular drink. I got strawberry lemonade. We waited about 15 minutes, but it would have only been 10 if I hadn't gotten animal fries. Not long at all for how busy it was. The food was great as always, and since I shop in this area often I'm excited to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm really not sure what all the hype is about. The service was friendly and fast. The burger patty was small but tasty - almost had a sweetness to it. The fries were just fries. Didn't seem to add much salt which was nice. They serve the fries with a salt packet. And then there was the milkshake - I got the basic vanilla shake. Didn't even finish it. It wasn't very good. Even though it was advertised as using \"real ice cream\" It tasted like and ice cream base for blended drinks. I didn't even finish half of it. 1st and last visit to In-N-Out."}
{"text":"The seating here is terrible but they do a great job at getting people their food very quickly!"}
{"text":"Just as the 5 Stars say this is as good as it gets for a good old fashioned hamburger, fries and a shake.  This location is my favorite because I like norther Scottsdale and all the surrounding shops, resorts and restaurants.  Like all In and Outs, this location is impeccable clean, bright and inviting.  The kids working the kitchen and counter look like All Americans from a past era and are always smiling and friendly.  The burgers are probably my favorite and I also love their fries and shakes.  I like that everything is fresh, never frozen and it tastes like it as well.  I can't say enough about In and Out which I've been patronizing since the mid 80's.  So glad they finally opened in Arizona."}
{"text":"I have been participating in my own personal debate about which chain hamburger joint is better - In-N-Out of Five Guys.  This is a discussion I can't really win either way because both of these quality chains offer some things the other does not.  I always like the vibe of every In-N-Out - nostalgic, clean, jumping with activity, friendly, etc.  Five Guys has peanuts, fresh cut jalapenos and a trippy Coca Cola soft drink dispenser that is loads of fun and features a lot of blends you can't find anywhere else.  Their burgers are probably equally delicious although I lean very slightly toward Five Guys here because of the wider variety of available toppings, etc.  You can't beat the size of an order of fries at Five Guys which are always overflowing inside the bag in addition to the huge cupful they provide.  The fries at In-N-Out are pretty special too - always fresh, never frozen.  I don't know about Five Guys' fries although they taste spectacular too.    This location seems as good as any of the In-N-Out stores and I've been to quite a few in a couple different states.  Always consistent and high quality.  The kids who work at these locations are always bright, friendly and on top of things."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum. Burgers are great. They've figured out how to handle drive-Thru...not only speedy but those handy containers. Well done! Will make it a stop whenever I can find one. Not in CO unfortunately."}
{"text":"No matter how \"stuffed\" you are from eating earlier, there is always room for an In-N-Out meal...single, animal-style, fries and a neapolitan shake please!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place many times. Because it's so close to the Las Vegas strip this location is always packed. It doesn't matter if you're going inside or using the drive through plan on a wait.  Also keep in mind that this isn't the best of neighborhoods."}
{"text":"Soul soothing good on every level of dirty-ness.  I am so glad that we don't have In-N-Out up here in the great white north, as it wouldn't be as fun to gorge myself on each visit south.  That's it! Yum.  My soul thanks you once again."}
{"text":"have you ever walked something like half a mile along the side of a highway - possibly causing traffic violations in the process - in order to get to food?  no? why the hell not?  it is probably always packed (there were at least 50 people on line when we got there), but fear not, Brave Traveler, your order will be taken surprisingly quickly (within ten minutes), and you shall receive unto thee a most sacred meal prepared by the high priests in their red-and-white uniforms (also within ten minutes).  my choice picks (off the secret menu): 1) mustard-grilled Double Double 2) Animal Style fries (shared these with my friend Keith) 3) Neapolitan shake (all three shake flavors mixed together)  it is not that expensive - the above order costs something like 8 bucks.  oh yeah, cabs will pull in to the parking lot to cart your bloated ass back to the Strip.  and the peasants rejoiced!"}
{"text":"Like all in-n-outs this has the best burgers!  Got a 3x3 animal style and animal style fries.  So yeah I went all out in my in-n-out craving since I live 6hrs away from nearest one.  And it was delish as usual!  This location is I believe always crowded since its near the ASU campus and sports facilities.  Very nice and upscale buildings next door too, so the drive through line has been about 10-15 cars deep the couple times we have been here.  But the wait isn't too too long, but sure it worth it, IMO!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love In-and-Out Burger; they are my favorite burger place ever!   The burgers are homemade just like the fries both are delicious, the condiments are a family recipe, and the patties are made to order. I really enjoy the burgers every time I get a chance to visit an In-and-Out location plus I highly recommend this place!  #30daysofYelp"}
{"text":"Coming from the East Coast, visiting an In-N-Out Burger is quite the treat. When in California and Arizona, I'm there. AND...... whenever we go to Vegas, our first stop off the plane is to....you guessed it. They are quite packed in Vegas so we always have a Plan B and Plan C location to fall back on. Imagine my amazement when I found out that this burger haven now has a location right off the Vegas Strip. It is officially listed as at The Linq, but is right around the corner from The Flamingo Hotel in the alleyway leading to the Giant Ferris Wheel. Now we were able to walk there after checking into our hotel. As with other locations, the crowd was plentiful but the young staff was quite efficient in filling the orders and getting the food in your hands in a reasonable time. My wife in the meantime secured a nice table outside. So, that's where the good review ends with the pleasant and efficient staff. They get the one star that I have awarded. As for the food......my love of all In-N-Outs has come crashing down to earth. I ordered my usual Double-Double and Fries. The burger which is usually juicy, was cooked beyond recognition. It was horribly overdone and I actually threw it out after eating half of it. My wife's was the same. Now, they can't also screw up the freshly made Fries, can they? Yes they can and they did! These Fries were so overdone, charred and dried out that they were like those dry straws you buy in a bag or can. How can they mess up what every other location has brilliantly delivered? I hope I'm not scarred for life, but for sure will never visit this location again. Hopefully it was an off day, but I won't be around to find out. Back to Plan B & C."}
{"text":"I honestly don't get what the fuss is over this place. If you mention In N Out to a casual, you get the same reaction as a middle aged housewife listening to Dave Matthews Band - endless fawning and drooling. The service is decent, but the order takers have no clue as to what's going on. The problem itself lies to the use of a \"secret menu.\" I don't refer to the tiny menu the restaurant has, but rather a set of secret code words to order your food to make it sound like you're \"cool\" and \"one of them.\" And they can't even get THAT right, as my \"mustard fried\" burger came out tasting the same like one of their normal burgers!  Let's talk about the burger itself. They are two ounce patties, and although the menu tops out at double-double, you can have four of these patties on your sandwich. But no bacon. Almost every other fast food restaurant allows bacon for an extra charge. But not at In N Out. They're special.  The standard burger (Yes, I'm calling it a burger here, deal with it fanboys) comes pre-dressed with lettuce, tomato, onion and this crap called \"Spread.\" Spread? What the #$!%@ is spread? Well it's a combination of ketchup, mayo and relish. I like these, but how hard is it to just mix it separately? Why make matters more complicated? You can customize your burger, but why not just do what Five Guys does? That being order the burger and then they ask what you want, and not assuming a set selection of toppings. Simplify.  The fries suck. Not sorry. They are cheap, but what you pay for is what you get. You get this tiny school lunch size carton with the tiniest, driest fries this side of McDonalds. They're not fries. They're fry-ettes. You can supposedly put this \"animal style\" sauce on the fries for no extra charge, but why should I have to guzzie up my food with something that looks like emesis?  They also serve Coca-Cola products, but they can't even get THAT right! Do you want Sprite? Tough break, you get 7-Up, instead. These people had 7-Up in their lineup for years and don't feel the need to switch, I guess.  Don't let the huge line fool you, folks. In N Out is overrated, overhyped and simply not worth it for the miniscule, medicore meal you get.  Oh, you're looking for a compliment? It's inexpensive. There.  As for me, if I get dragged into one of these places, I'll go IN... N I'll head right back OUT to a better place. Like Five Guys."}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out ... It'd be a while since I'd last had it ...but it's so well worth it!  I can go on and on about how friendly and efficient the staff is ... or how good the  burgers are ... but really, I tried animal style fries for the first time today ... WOW.  So good.  Not a treat you can have often (if you want to continue fitting into your clothing size) but once in a while is a must.  I love In-N-Out.  :-)"}
{"text":"We stopped by for a quick bite to eat, and unfortunately our car wouldn't start when we left. We went inside and talked to the staff, and the manager, a really nice guy named Geoff, came out himself and jumped our car. This is seriously customer service that goes above and beyond what's required, and they really deserve recognition for that! As for the food, it's always delicious and fresh!"}
{"text":"All the times I've been to the West Coast, this was my first visit. What's wrong with me?? This place is good. I expected it to be similar to McDonalds, but it's nothing like Mickey D's at all. First of all, all they do is burgers. No chicken or fish sandwiches to get in the way. And, the burgers are made with real meat, imagine that! In addition to the burgers, they make french fries and have drinks....that's it! The fries are good too. Not greasy at all. I heard about long wait times, but I have to say, that at this location anyway, they moved the line very quickly. We only waited a total of 4 minutes from ordering the food to them calling our number to pick it up and considering the long line, I thought that was pretty fast. We were able to find a seat easily also. If I lived on the West Coast, I'd be in trouble with this place lol."}
{"text":"I always enjoy a visit to In-N-Out.  They by far have the best fast food burger.  Great burgers and a great price what more could you want!  Their burgers are really fresh tasting and not the greasy mess at some of the other places.  The buns are still crisp and with all the fixes to include fried onions it is perfect.     I also enjoy their secret menu items and always get my fries animal style.  With the tasty sauce, cheese and fried onions is makes their already delicious fries even better.  My daughter gets the Flying Dutchman burger which is a double double with lettuce vice a bun.  She just loves it.    The service is outstanding at this location despite the fact they are always busy.    My recent visits where well after lunch but that doesn't matter at In-N-Out as good burger cravings need to be satisfied all day!  They make you burger and fries fresh so you may have to wait a few minutes to get it but it is always worth the wait.  They actually grill their burgers and don't use some crazy contraption to cook them like a few national chains do.   The inside is bright white and they have plenty of clean tables to sit down and enjoy your burger and fries.  They keep the dining area very clean all day long.  You can tell the folks working at In-N-Out take pride in their job.  I look forward to my next Double Double and Animal fries!"}
{"text":"What more can be said about this CA institution.  All I can say is it was a good today as the first time I had it in LA in 1988.  There isn't too many Burger chains that can live up to the In and Out Standard.  Fresh ingredients and the quality meat make for a great burger.  One my friends on the East Coast envy and wish they had an In and Out in their town.      A Double Double and Animal Style fries are my standard order.  The burger is everything I expect and the fries and unique and tasty.  The Animal Style adding onions, cheese sauce and special sauce make the fries an even tastier treat.  Didn't get a shake this time but they are also made with good ice cream and remind me of the Soda Shops from my early childhood.  Great location and always busy but they move folks through fast.  The service is always good and friendly which is another In and Out motto."}
{"text":"What can I say?  All burgers are not made equal.  I have eaten at 3 of the Valley's In n Outs, Blue Diamond and Eastern, but this location makes them better, I don't know why that is.  Since moving west to Las Vegas I have discovered that I have been deprived all these years of a truly good burger at a fast food joint.  This place rocks."}
{"text":"Worth the wait - love this place - lucky if i get it every 5-10 years. You can't go wrong with in-n-out. Menu isnt big so just het a burger and fries. I suggest the burger \"animal style\" and pink lemonade if you are't getting a milkshake."}
{"text":"re:  dinner  This place is as consistent as any other In-N-Out with less of a wait.  It's a little off the strip, so if you do not have a vehicle if visiting Vegas, it would make it tough to eat here.  If there's such thing as Quality Fast Food, this is it.  *cheers*"}
{"text":"Great burger great fries even better prices. Hot and fresh is hard to beat. Milkshakes are also just as good."}
{"text":"First time here after years of watching people eating here and talking to people and getting their options about it. I got the double double animal style and it was awesome and everything I ever dreamed about lol. Definitely top burger in the fast food industry (sorry Big Mac we had a good run bro)"}
{"text":"Disappointing burger on a Saturday night. Our first stop after getting our rental car we decided to avoid the location on Tropicana nearest the Strip and come to this location. Big mistake! The drive thru was mobbed and they had someone taking orders car side which was nice. But the long wait yielded us an overcooked, dry burger. First time we've ever had a bad In-N-Out Burger. Thankfully, our usual location brought us back to hamburger nirvana a few days later!"}
{"text":"Always a treat to eat a good juicy burger while in Vegas! Protein style for me (lettuce wrap instead of the bun)! Good solid food at good prices."}
{"text":"right off the flight from nyc, and the very first thing i do is get my in n out fix. lol obvi.   the hamburger was dry, honestly. it wasnt particularly satisfying as a result. but the animal fries were crispy and piled high, which salvaged the meal.   i still stand by my claim that shake shack is better than in n out. but as far as a 2.50 burger is concerned, this got the job done."}
{"text":"Me and my friend love stopping at In-and-Out at night, this particular night we decided we had to go get a burger and fries.  We've been to this location before, so we decided to wait in the long drive so we can talk in the car versus stand in a line inside.  As we are in line, the worker puts up cones in front of our car (there is also a car behind us). No acknowledgement or nothing when he did it.  Maybe he was new but huh?  What the F?    There were a bunch of cars already in line, why wouldn't he put the cones behind the last car?  How would 2 to 4 extra hamburgers and fries make any difference?    Anyway, we were pissed and left pissed and are still pissed.  Young workers need to just pay attention because we love In-N-Out."}
{"text":"Had the cheeseburger and fries last night. Fries weren't crunchy at all. Disappointing. I figure fries are supposed to have a crunch factor? Right?! Wasn't worth the hassle to replace them. It was complete chaos in there as customers were purposely standing in front of your table as you ate while waiting for you to get up and leave."}
{"text":"Yet another In & Out is the ever growing list of my visits to this chain. You can definitely say I am a groupie. I would say this visit was on the upper end if the scale. When we arrived at about 9PM the restaurant was actually slow! This meant that we would have those delicious burgers, fries and shakes pronto. I ordered my standard double/double meal and a shake and sure enough it was sitting in front of me in 5 minutes. As I savored the first bite it occurred to me that the pleasure here is all mine. Simple food done very well and served by friendly, energetic young people. In&Out. What is your secret?"}
{"text":"A Valley staple! Nice, simple ordering system, relatively quick service, always cheerful employees, and nice n clean. Prices are very good for \"gourmet\" fast food, and its served with a smile. You don't get service like that many places these days, and I appreciate the efforts In N Out makes to do this."}
{"text":"Ok....let's be real.... anyone that is a burger lover knows that In-N-Out is just fantastic, are there better burger joints???? Of course....but if you are a Fan of In-N-Out you know the quality is always there ( No Surprises) I have been a fan for years and it has always been one of my favorite go to places.  It's like anything else you have to just follow your taste buds for that occasion, this establishment has never let me down."}
{"text":"Man--these burgers are good.  There is nothing remotely comparable back East and that is truly very, very sad."}
{"text":"Drive-through only visit. The cashier was very personable. The protein style burger tasted amazing. The parking lot appeared to be maintained."}
{"text":"When we want a burger and fries, this is the place for us! Good quality and good tasting food! Plus the wife loves their shakes and I am all about the animal style!"}
{"text":"They got my protein-style double-double right this time. : )  Although I will always check my receipt going forward. PR for protein style (wrapped in lettuce, no bun) and GR for grilled onions. Google 'secret menu in n out'. They are full of surprises."}
{"text":"Kudos to our cashier Andrew R. He did an excellent job making sure our fairly complicated order was correct. He also anticipated our needs, which is a great skill to have in the restaurant and service industry. If you like crispy fries make sure to ask for them well done. Also, for low carb options you can get your burger 'protein style' (wrapped in lettuce). Make sure to search online for their secret menu items, like 'animal fries'."}
{"text":"Wow, kudos to Ariel, super professional, it is clear that In n Out trains their employees really well about customer care, but Ariel went above and beyond. Great job!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE in-n-out burgers! i usually get mine #2 animal style fries and animal style cheeseburger. I think the workers are really friendly and they try their best to make the food and customer service the best they can. I think in-n-out have one of the most flavorful burgers along with their fresh meat and fries. Their smoothie is also yummy!... You can order your fries with just cheese or even cooked longer etc. I love it here! My favorite burger joint"}
{"text":"This is all just my opinion--it's all what you are accustomed to eating.    What is the hoopla all about? The cheeseburger was thin and tasteless. The fries were awful. I don't know, maybe I am spoiled by Shack Shack burgers or Five Guys or even Sonic!  The reason for my two stars would be their chocolate shake. That was excellent."}
{"text":"As a former California resident, I love and miss In n Out.  Stopped in today and had some dang fine burgers, just like I remember.  This location is super busy, located just across the freeway from NYNY.  There's a restaurant and a separate building next door for retail.  They have the happiest, friendliest employees in fast food.  Holy crap! Even Chick-fil-A could take notes from this location of In n Out. After devouring two protein style burgers (go for two burgers instead of a double to maximize the salad), I stopped in next door to pick up some t-shirts for the kids.  They had a great selection, all very reasonably priced for the teenaged crew who love graphic shirts.  I'll be dreaming of my meal here till the next time I'm out West. If you're not familiar with In n Out, study up ahead on their secret menu for all the best choices and order like a pro."}
{"text":"Sweet mama! It's the real deal here. In-N-Out's food quality is superb. Keeping it old school with real cheese, 100% beef, and fresh ingredients. Even the fries and buns are cooked here. A smart, simple menu. You'd think the price would be outrageous but no, it rivals any other fast food restaurant ON ALL LEVELS and you won't end up with a stomach ache afterwards from food packed with preservatives and who knows what else.   The drive thru line was crazy long when we pulled in but it moved quickly. Customer service was awesome even during the packed lunch hour. The person taking our order sounded like the friendliest gal in Arizona. At window one, the person we paid was happy as a clam at high tide and read back our order at super human speed. We could see employees slicing and dicing through the big windows in the drive thru line while we waited, who waved at us and our pups. Then at window two when we picked up our food, we had our order read to us again with a big smile and a \"have a great day!\".   I think I'm in love with you, In-N-Out Burger."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Las Vegas and amazing service!! I'm always amazed with the consistency of the burgers and excellent service."}
{"text":"To die for!! It was the very first stop when I got to Las Vegas lol My cheeseburger and animal fries were soooo goodddd! I was in heaven omg (eyes roll back). Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my first stop when in NV, CA or AZ.  Can't help but preach the I&O gospel and gain evangelists to try their first burger.  This happened on the Duece in Vegas riding on the strip.      ANIMAL FRIES while people watching.  Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times and the service is always friendly and fast. Orders were always correct. Prices are very reasonable. Only con is the limited menu, but hey, that's how they work so fast."}
{"text":"I grew up eating at In-N-Out in California, and then I moved to the East Coast.  I miss this place, and go whenever I travel.  I keep things simple--plain hamburger and fries.  I also love their shakes.  Please come to NY.  Please?"}
{"text":"Good food at a great price - went to the restaurant on a Tuesday night and there was a line in the drive thru.  However, a staff member was outside taking orders, and food orders were processed quickly.  Meal was hot and tasted fresh.  Portions are nice for the cost, and there is an overall good value for the items.  Would return here again."}
{"text":"Trying this place for the first time and this place is packed not even McDonald's gets this crazy. The double burger is awesome I was surprised to only see 3 burgers on the menu. There keeping it simple 10 times better then all the burgers that I have tried"}
{"text":"West coast people always speak so highly of this place. I was not impressed. The fries were not good at all and the burger was average."}
{"text":"I've had 3 opportunities to get In-N-Out this year and FINALLY was able to during my 2nd trip to Vegas...in fact it was our first stop from the airport...suitcases and all.  Before going, Valerie G. and I researched the secret menu so we can get the most of our In-N-Out experience. (http://daviswiki.org/In-N-Out_Secret_Menu)  I settled for the double double, extra toasted, extra pickles, animal style, cut in half burger with well done animal style fries. It took me awhile to get my order out and the lady was so nice and didn't rush me at all. The burger was really good...but I have to stay true to my roots and taste buds and say Shake Shack is better (although In-N-Out is cheaper). A lot of people have issues with the fries but I find that getting them well done really makes a difference. I actually like the fries better at In-N-Out than at Shake Shack.  Don't forget to ask for a free hat and stickers! =D"}
{"text":"Can In-N-Out ever be BAD??..... I DONT THINK SO!!   The fact that such a simple concept has kept it's quality & service up to par  for so many years just AMAZES me!   This location ALWAYS seems to be busy... but i think every location is busy... Literally there are ALWAYS cars in the drive through.... even at times you would not expect people to be eating.  I was in the drive through when it was their closing time but their enthusiasm was still there... they didn't sound crabby or irritated in any way.   They had a smile the whole time... & you could definately hear if a person is smiling or not too.   The burgers are ALWAYS fresh & their fries are always the best because they are NEVER frozen... as you drive through the drive through you see them cutting fresh potatoes. It also ALWAYS amazes me how the burgers come out wrapped all pretty & not sloppy joe status.   Overall food for cost is GREAT & service for the style of service is ABOVE & BEYOND!"}
{"text":"Best burger hands down. Fresh, filling and a great value. Lunch for $6."}
{"text":"What's not to love about In and Out Burger. Simple Menu, fresh ingredients, and robotic like trained staff. Watch them, before you even walk through the door, the spotter calls out how many people are approaching. Burger dude then lays down that many patties. So, your goods are cooking as you order. That's FN smart!  Also, I did the code names like animal style, protein style (This scared me when I first heard it. It means something totally different in my hood) and more.  The staff rocks and the place is always clean. Fast, efficient, turn and burn. Simple system that is now being adopted by Chipotle, Blaze, Fired Pie, and Gadzooks to name a few. It is just good food and a quick stop that is not overpriced. I like it!!!!  #vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate  ."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night and place was deserted but the crew in the back was hustling and bustling like it was lunch hour. The cashier Geovani was extremely helpful and polite which you don't see in a teenager this day. I asked him to explain to me what animal style was and he explained it so well to a first timer. Our food was freshly made and tasty but is a bit salty."}
{"text":"I Dream about these burgers, they are delish great service everytime I go even though theri always so busy"}
{"text":"Not impressed. I'd rather have a Big Mac and fries at McDonald's. Can't understand why some rave about it."}
{"text":"Delicious hamburgers with natural fries. Is always very crowded but worths the waiting."}
{"text":"I think that burgers are pretty disgusting.  I will never have a craving for a burger.  I'll eat a burger if I'm at a barbeque and that's the only thing to eat.  However, for some reason, I can never say \"no\" to an In-N-Out burger.  Maybe I'm sucked into all of the hype or maybe I find it exotic since there aren't any In-N-Outs here in the Midwest.  Whatever it is, I think it's delicious!  It's such a treat whenever I'm in California or Vegas.  One time we even packed some to go before we boarded the plane; each item was separated to prevent it from becoming soggy; however it wasn't the same.  I love In-N-Out....everything's so fresh and I also love the fries!!  This place was packed because we went during lunchtime, so there was a wait, but it was well worth it!  I will definitely re-visit when I go back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Sometimes class isn't high heels and a slinky black dress...not that I don't look good in it.  Sometimes class isn't a martini shaken not stirred...especially with some good Banker's Club gin.  Sometimes class isn't a Picasso hanging in a mansion...it could be a LSD induced caricature of your arresting officer on one ply jail toilet paper.   This time class is a double double animal style with freshly cut animal style fries and a small coke. This time class is a chain burger joint that won't over expand and lose the quality.   For those of you who have never truly lived...and by that I mean someone who has never went to In-N-Out Burger...this is the single greatest burger joint in the United States of America...hands down. Sure...White Castle is great and you need something to flush out the evil the next day...but if you aren't looking for some weird burger cleansing ritual than this is the place to go.   The meat is never frozen. The fries are cut fresh all day. The burgers are cooked to order. It takes a little longer, and you will not get in and out very quickly...but class like this isn't done quickly.  I admire In-N-Out because they refuse to compromise their style and you can taste it in every bite. Go. Go as often as possible when you find one.  This is class. This is love. This is living."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with In-N-Out. As a native of the East Coast, you are naturally drawn to the attention of these burgers and fries. Everything here is reasonably priced and you really get a good bang for your buck. I usually just order protein style burgers, but if I'm feeling adventurous and tubby I go animal style. The food does take some time to come out, but everything is made on the spot so quality takes time. I literally saw a worker hauling real potatoes into the kitchen; unless they use them as bricks to throw at people, those are your french fries."}
{"text":"Things I Like That I Know I Shouldn't:  Pickle juice straight from the jar. \"Rock Star\" by Nickelback. A 4x4 with animal style fries from In-N-Out.  The \"secret menu\" is the best practical joke since Mariah Carey's movie career. It's not secret (In-N-Out has the damn thing posted on its website) and it's not much of a menu as it is just more combinations of food and condiments (except maybe the Grilled Cheese).   Yet for all my mockery, I myself am obsessed with this fast food phenomenon. Out of going to In-N-Out for two years, I haven't ordered anything off the \"regular menu\" in 23 months. And even then, I make one of my awestruck lackeys do it for me. It's become campus lore that if you owe Jetta a favor, expect visit In-N-Out holding a sheet of pink paper with the most nonsensical order in the history of lunch runs written on it in pink lettering.  Jetta helped you get a 90 on that test? Flying Dutchman with well done fries. Jetta came in on her day off to cover your shift in the computer lab? Grilled Cheese, light fries, and a neopolitan shake. Jetta talked your boyfriend into agreeing to a threesome with your and your best friend? You better keep it coming, because all 3x3s and animal style fries in the world will not get that harrowing, harrowing memory out of my fucking head.  While the life of a secret menu-aire may seem glamorous, it does have it pitfalls. Occasionally I send out for a protein burger (comes wrapped in a lettuce bun) and instead get a 2x2 with no condiments. Or I asked for \"extra toast\" and got a little baggie of slightly burnt buns. Oh, and who can forget the time I sent out for In N Out and got back a bag of McDonald's and a scolding on how it is very mean to write down an order with items that aren't on the menu. That's how I discovered McDonald's southwest chicken sandwich.   Following the secret menu is like following UFOs or cryptozoology. It's rewarding when you find a location that provides your mysterious heart attack sandwich, but other times you (or the person you sent to get your lunch) end up looking like an idiot in front of the cashier.   Still, the thrill of the plunder is worth the hassle and risk of embarrassment. Sure, that calorie bomb was never meant for human consumption, but fuck it, it was on the secret menu. It's practically a treasure.   I guess that's the ultimate joy of the In N Out experience. Getting something that (at least we are lead to believe) the average casual fast foodie does not get to experience. Fuck the casual eaters. Only real drive-thru pirates deserve the good shit."}
{"text":"In-N-Out offers the best fast food burger period.  There is no other chain that even comes close - they are in a league of their own.  The burger is juicy-messy and really transcends the traditional fast food category.  This burger could go head-to-head with all but the best hamburgers offered anywhere in the world. The fries are really good too.  Gluttons like me do the following:  1) Order two grilled cheese sandwiches - cheese only. 2) Order a double-double animal style, protein style (this means it will be served on a lettuce wrap instead of a bun) 3) Remove the burger from the lettuce wrap and place it between the two grilled cheese sandwiches.  (photo submitted)"}
{"text":"In-N-Out is one of the places you seek out when you're sick of crappy buffets and shitty $3.99 steak and eggs and you want some good, cheap food to remind you of home. It's pretty hard to beat a Double Double with some fries...unless of course you're going to Fatburger over on The Strip."}
{"text":"Been to about 15 different locations in various states and as usual it is always awesome. Burgers are AMAZING and you don't get fresh fries at very many places anymore. Love IN-N-OUT!!!!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out is almost always amazing.  The location off of yorkshire by costco is always on point, the burgers are always cooked perfect, they almost seem to melt in your mouth.  However, this location is terrible.  I live close to this location so we tend to come here more frequently due to convenience.  I've probably eaten from this location 50+ times over the last 7 years and every single time the burgers are over cooked, dry hockey pucks.  Its extremely disappointing!  Everything else about this location is just fine but if you can't cook a burger right it kinda ruins the whole experience."}
{"text":"Celebrating...meat-iocrity!  Tried UC Irvine INOB last month but apparently did it wrong. Now in the know, I ordered animal style double and animal style fries. While better than my CA foray, a standard double/fries/drink meal, I still found this to be average schlock. It's the Miller Lite of fast food burgers. Popular, but inexplicably. I think I have a go-against-the-masses gene.   A BK Whopper is no fancy fast food burger, but to me it's more Miller High Life. It's the champagne of burgers. Has actual meat and grill/charcoal taste and a good balance of toppings. Fries are way better too! INOB fries are disastrously bad! Like deep fried cardboard!  Simple menu, cheery staff, and a cute look earn this place three stars. How it takes 15 min to get an order also when they have approximately three things on their menu is beyond me and beyond the pale!   Pass!!"}
{"text":"While this wasn't my first In-n-Out experience, it was my first in a over a decade and I have to say, I remember it a lot better than it actually is.  OK, don't get worked up. It just didn't thrill me.  It was fresh, well made and just fine.  I just don't want to build a temple in the building and worship it like others seem to!    I got a double double with onion (and when they mean with onion, they mean it!), fries and a chocolate shake.  I liked the burger (could have done without the special sauce, which to me is just thousand island), liked the fries, although they needed more salt and loved the shake (perfect consistency and chocolatey taste).   The place was packed, the service was fine and the price was right!  I would go go back, but I like Five Guys better - sorry I do!!"}
{"text":"This is the Best fast food burger anyWhere to be found, BETTER THAN FIVE GUYS and RAY'S HELL BURGER HANDS DOWN.  IT IS FLAVORFUL AND DELICIOUS, NOT GREASY AND NOT OVERPRICED!  THE BUN IS GOOD AND THE CONDIMENTS ARE GREAT TOO!  The other thing is the polite and courteous staff, the place is immaculate too!  I wish they'd coem out East!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out  I don't do burgers often, but when I do, I do you.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kxYiZnd7Y-3ibdwnMFuTzw?select=Sp3cyoRY6Zoz_sNI0AXycg#_xZXL51twt-oaKO6MHTTiw  This is the burger I measure all other burgers to and as far as taste, price and consistency goes nothing else compares.   ANIMAL STYLE FOR LIFE."}
{"text":"It's was ok. I had it a few years back and it was much better. I'm not sure what changed but won't be running back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Always top notch.  The service is hyper-friendly, and you can do NO wrong.  Their selection is simple, 1 2 3 4.  The fries are cut and dried in front of my eyes.  The burgers are great, as well.  I haven't seen them made but they are cooked quickly and slapped on your bun. I've gone to in-n-out for 12+ years and I've always been awe struck by the whole system.  Anywhere you go and leave happier than you were before is awesome in my book."}
{"text":"They have the best burgers... I love me some animal style!  This food ally by the high roller was a nice addition for Vegas."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding as usual, the place was kept immaculately clean, and my burger was hot fresh and super yummy! The place is new but everything is efficient and pleasant. Your greeted at the door, your order is taken with a greeting and a smile, and your food is made to order hot and fresh! The tables are cleared and cleaned by staff members quickly, so that the next guest can be seated! Definitely recommended if your down in the Linq!"}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of fast food but I make an exception with in and out. Their burgers actually taste like they are made with real meat and real ingredients that are fresh. Their fries are not super greasy and their milkshakes are icing on the cake"}
{"text":"Long line but totally worth the wait... Just as good in Vegas as in Cali :-)"}
{"text":"Check your bags folks!!! I drove the 40 min round trip journey to get the highly requested In-and-Out for dinner. Like an idiot I didn't check my bag before driving home. Unlike other fast food chains this place has never messed up my order so I've been lulled into a false sense of security.   Upon arrival at home I discovered 4 burgers for my 5 person family. Like any good mother I graciously handed my children food and watched them savor each bite (while secretly wanting to throw an adult temper tantrum).  Lesson learned? Always check your bag no matter how on point a place usually is. Everyone assures me their food was delicious. I can vouch the fries were good...but alas I am out not only my money, but my personal dinner as well."}
{"text":"FINALLY! it happened! was it worth the hype? -- nope.  I didn't enjoy the food at all. Nothing about it was delicious or fresh. Thanks for the experience though!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out is one of those places that I eat at when I'm on vacation as they don't have them in Colorado. Everyone raves about them and each time I go, they are packed. Personally, I think they are similar to Freddy's but not as good. The thing they have going for them is they are cheap. You can easily get a double cheeseburger with fries and a drink (plus a shake) for around $10. Other than that, it's a solid fast food burger and not much else."}
{"text":"Double double, protein style, grilled onions, fries.  The ne plus ultra of American fast food.  If you've never had it, you just won't understand.  Our second stop after leaving McCarran.  (First stop Total Wine)."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge burger fan but if I was then this would be a place I would come to. I've only tried their protein style burger because I'm trying to cut on carbs. Their burgers are pretty tasty.  I've tried their fries animal style and got extra sauce in the side because there's just not enough for the bottom fries. The fries are not as good as mcdonalds, I mean I don't think anyone has better fries than mcdonalds but getting it here animal style is just to die for. :)"}
{"text":"mmmmm yummy juicy flavorful burgers.  We did not have an in--out burger in Hawaii so whenever people came to visit they insisted that I try one of the burgers if I ever made it to the mainland.  Now that i moved here, i came here several times.  Each time the service rocks and the burger is so ono.  I order it protein style cause I'm not a huge fan of bread.  The burgers have tons of flavor and I must say this is one of my favorite burger joints.  My only complaint is the type of lettuce they use.  I wished it was romaine instead.  Other than that everything is perfect.  Cheap burger that tastes great.  What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Why do other burger places even exist? Bomb burgers and fries that are always consistent. Friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"I am an animal and I can prove it because I ate the whole animal style burger and the fries.   It was so good and now I am way too full but happy.   I am glad we don't have them in Denver.  Wait no I am not.  I wish I had a burger and fries from In N Out now."}
{"text":"I drove all over town because I was lost. I thought I knew Tempe. You would think I could use Siri or my map on my phone.  No I guess I am stubborn.  Anyway I did find it but it was not easy to get into the area so I had to drive around again until there it was right in front of me.  Finally I ordered a burger,fries and a diet coke.  I was content and could try and find my way back to Chandler.  Well once again I used my keen senses to find my way back.  I was so happy to be home.    I am glad I live where there is no In-N-Out but if there was one around home I think I would seek it out here and there.  I love burgers but I really am crazy for their fries."}
{"text":"Great service, and consistent food quality. Wish they had a bigger dining room though, because sometimes you have to stand or eat in 110 degree heat"}
{"text":"After hiking the Lost Dog Trail in the McDowells (green & healthy  but not many wild flowers yet) I decided a burger and fries sounded good.  Five bucks even for a hot burger, hot fries and cold shake is a good deal plus it all tasted good.  Crowded but just as quick and good as in Southern CA."}
{"text":"First time eating here as we are from New Mexico when I saw this i was instantly excited ! I gave this a 3 star rating simply because the burger was good.  It was a tad salty and we ordered the cheese fries everyone was raving about and Ick! Salty salty fries with a slab of sliced cheese is what we got  ! This place does not live up to the hype ! Id rather have a Fuddruckers burger and fries."}
{"text":"Simply the best fast food burger around today. Ingredients are fresh, service is fast and friendly, and the quality is always top notch. Not to mention the prices are really affordable. I've tried all the other fast food burger joints and none of them stack up against In and Out.   I always get the double double, extra toasted bun with peppers. I also request the fries crispy. They fry them a bit longer which adds a nice crunch. Sometimes I'll have them throw cheese on the fries or get them animal style if I'm feeling frisky. Don't forget about the chili peppers they offer you on the side if you want some added spice to your meal. Be careful though, the chili peppers are very spicy."}
{"text":"Overall the same standard at this as all in and out burgers. I had the cheeseburger combo protein style and my friend the double double combo with a strawberry milkshake. All are what you expect in terms of value. The strawberry shake was fine but not a home run for me. Not sure if this is the first time I've noticed, but there are banana peppers available as a condiment!! This really upgraded my experience :) otherwise, the location is clean, friendly and easy to find/park.   Bottom line... if you are looking for a standard in and out...this place is it. They had the on and off menu options and plus banana peppers which upgraded our usual experience :)   Pros Usual in and out standard  Standard menu  Clean restaurant and easy to park/access Bathrooms were clean   Cons  The strawberry shake was fine but nothing spectacular here...maybe the vanilla is better?"}
{"text":"My 1st time experiencing in n out was a couple months back with my boys and we were all fans. The burgers were juicy and fresh. Great atmosphere. My boys would probably eat there more if I allowed them too. We will return."}
{"text":"No complaints about this In-N-Out.  They've managed to block off the left side of the drive thru so that no one could cut in front of anyone that was waiting on the right side. A definite plus and it shows that they are aware of what's going on even outside of the restaurant.   Their burgers aren't the best I have ever had, but they are definitely not bad at all. I myself love crispy fries, but they have the best soggy fries :)  Their customer service is always amazing and they never fail to get all of my orders correct every time. I have never left their drive thru missing anything from my order. And I love that they have accessible trash cans in case you decide to eat in your car.  They definitely take care of their customers and their food is very affordable."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in here on a weekend day for a quick lunch and while it was packed we did find a table so while I grabbed that my boyfriend went and ordered our food. He ordered 2 cheeseburgers with mustard and ketchup and I got a cheeseburger with everything including onion. Well, mine had no onion and his had grilled onions on it....oh well...Overall it wasn't to bad. I know if we would have sent it back they would have fixed it but it really wasn't worth the trouble."}
{"text":"What's all the fuss about?  I just don't get it.  The burgers were fine, but nothing special.  The fries were truly mediocre - lacking in flavor.  The vanilla shake was so stiff that it was hard to drink, and when it softened enough that I could drink it, it wasn't great.  I know this chain is popular, and their restaurants are snazzy, their staff in natty uniforms - but honestly I just wasn't wowed.  The fries at McDonalds are far better.  In and Out burgers are better than  those at McDonalds or Burger King, but that's a pretty low bar.  Not worthy of all the hype."}
{"text":"I had the animal style burger and wasn't that impressed. I can totally see why this burger is popular out in the West coast, it has a very clean and fresh taste (not common in East coast burgers), but it's not my style for a burger."}
{"text":"Big fan of the burgers here, double double Animal style all day, with fries and a chocolate shake. Drive thru is always slammed and even if you go inside you are still going to wait 5-10 mins for most orders, I think it's worth the wait, but if you are in a rush, head somewhere else"}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this lace out, I always see people posting pictures. I finally tried it out annnnd it was okay a typical burger joint nothing to special."}
{"text":"Delicious, meaty amazing food. The burgers are awesome, service is great, and the secret menu is cool. Their People are very delicious. Very meaty."}
{"text":"This was the only horribly rude experience I have ever had at in and out burger...  I walked in and there was no line an I was carrying my service dog puppy in my arms and everyone commented on how cute she was except this rude girl with acne approximately 23-28 years of age walked over with a scowl on her face looked at me and walked away. She seems to have been some lower level manager since nobody corrected her.   I paid for my order and then she came back and told me to leave. I told her this is my service dog and as such by federal law is allowed to a accompany me literally anywhere and besides she is in my arms, not running loose.   She insisted that I leave anyway, so I left.   WORST IN AND OUT EMPLOYEE EVER!!!  I WILL NOT RETURN TO THIS LOCATION AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Terrible Parking, Terrible Long Lines, Terrible Diarrhea!!!!!!!  We have occasionally frequented In-N-Out Burger for years. They are know for superior customer service and reliable quality fast food at good prices.   The college kid crowds were looking so intensely that you literally have a line out the driveway and around the block to get food! Parking is a near impossibility here on a weekend night. I just wanted a late bite to feed my inner animal as I got back into town....   What killed me about my trip here is that I got REALLY SICK! I hadn't eaten all day and was super hungry bordering HANGRY and I got a couple double doubles and commenced to eating them or more so devouring them.   The next morning I had some toxic was diarrhea from Hades tearing my guts apart with some agonizing cramps and smells that make you never want to eat food again!   All in all I am imagining there was some improper hygiene somewhere along the way in this location...   I know one thing, I am not going back to this place!   But hey, if you love diarrhea... This place may be just the thing for you... Bring your friends and enjoy the death that flows for 12 hours afterwards!"}
{"text":"I don't know what you guys see or taste, I think it's overrated. I ordered double2, and did not even taste the meat! Not eating this again."}
{"text":"Its In-N-Out when you want a burger animal style find one and enjoy."}
{"text":"Solid burgers. Fresh cut fries. No complaints here!  I don't really eat a lot of burgers - in fact I rarely eat them - but whenever I am in Phoenix I always walk to this location near my sister-in-laws house.  Burgers come off the grill piping hot and perfectly cooked.  Just plain yummy. I skip whatever the heck that special sauce is and get ketchup and mustard instead. I'm a simple girl, simple eater. The fries are good with ketchup - don't think that  I could eat them plain. I appreciate the fact that they aren't over salted since I'm not really a fan of salt. It jacks me up."}
{"text":"I enjoy In-&-Out Burger because they keep it simple. They make a great basic burger & don't try any tricks. They kind of temind me of the early days of McDonalds back in the 60s when you just went there for a good cheap burger. In-&-Out is reasonably priced and good quality. What more could you ask for when you just want a quick bite to eat?"}
{"text":"This place is just as good as the original!  Fresh, hot and delicious -- just like Cali makes.  And just to prove how good this location is, there is almost always a packed lobby and a drive thru backed up several cars deep through the parking lot.  But the service is prompt, top notch and of course personable.  They have never gotten my order wrong here nor have they ever not greeted me with a friendly smile and hello.  Simply put, they are awesome!!  Keep it up guys!!  Food is excellent.  OG In-N-Out good as I stated above.  And I know OG In-N-Out, I have been getting double-double's from the So Cal restaurants since the early 1980's as a kid.  The founding family would be proud...."}
{"text":"The lines may be super long but that's what you expect when going to In-N-Out.. it's worth it! We go through the drive-thru pretty quickly and the employees are very nice! They're very hard working people! So I respect them and I don't mind waiting in line for a while for the good food plus their great customer service!"}
{"text":"My brother is visiting from Seattle, where apparently they do not have In 'n' Out Burgers! So of course we had to go. The menu could not be simpler, and for once, a fast-food burger looks like what's advertised. Will definitely go again when I'm craving a burger and fries."}
{"text":"I still don't get the long lines for this place but understand its a California favorite. It's very well run having employees outside with handheld devices to take your order at busy times. I love that the menu is super simple too.  I loved the cheeseburger but not a big fan of the french fries."}
{"text":"Usually when you are not visiting Cali, but in Vegas, you definitely go to this In-N-Out location off the Las Vegas Strip!    Make sure to check out the secret menu online if you are interested in ordering what does not appears on the actual in-person menu!    When I used to live in L.A., the protein-style burger was my choice!  But now that I am visiting the West Coast, I opt for the cheeseburger!  Since there are no In-N-Out spots on the East coast, I crave the animal-style fries from In-N-Out!  I have to hit up this spot whenever I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"IN-N-OUT is the -KING- of fast food burger places! I am from SoCal is so is IN-N-OUT.  They are a HUGE hit there, but it's not as much, here in Phoenix I've noticed. Double-Double is a like a backyard burger..delicious! Crispy lettuce, lots of fully-melted cheese (not kinda melted like at most fast food places). Fresh fries from potatoes that they chop up right there in their store, thick shakes made with real ice cream! ....The prices are very reasonable because they stick to the basics: Burgers, Fries, Drinks & Shakes...That's it... No salads or chicken or fish sandwiches here! ....The Best over ALL others!"}
{"text":"This hamburger joint is a favorite of Californians.  The drive thru is almost always backed up but there is usually someone out at the drive thru taking orders with a handheld device so it makes it go faster. Hamburgers are okay, not my favorite. French fries are made fresh but again not my favorite. Burgers, fries and shakes are the only choices on the menu here."}
{"text":"The worst french fries EVER.  Wouldn't feed in n out fries 2 my dog.  That said, the burgers are slightly better than average.  I would rather pay more and get Fatburger."}
{"text":"Classic. The only time I have ever had In-N-Out. Too bad I'm hooked now and can't get my fix in the Midwest! Please bring it to the Midwest! This location was great. The service was friendly and very quick, it was very busy. Soda fountain and tables were clean and tidy."}
{"text":"How can you visit the west coast and not eat in n out burger ! They have this amazing secret sauce they put on there burgers and fries ^_^ it's like a thousand island basically but it's so good! Def a must try for a quick bite"}
{"text":"Always great food!! I think at every location you walk in and there is a line and people standing around waiting for food and maybe one small table open. They always seem to have tables come open just in time. Burgers are always great. I always get animal fries and everything always has good flavor to it. We will always be back!!"}
{"text":"awesome burgers! the service is always super friendly! avoid the drive thru its more like a parking lot."}
{"text":"Double-double with cheese and a shake.....nice.  It's IN and OUT and it's Vegas....that's pretty nice."}
{"text":"This was my first In-N-Out experience, and I was excited, because I am not from an area with this chain. I ordered the Animal Style burger, since that's what Anthony Bordain suggests. I also ordered fries. We took our order to go - and I am glad we did because it was pretty packed in there (a Friday at lunch time). We drove home, about a 10 minute drive, and began our feast. I really enjoyed my burger, and definitely understand why people argue that this is the best fast-food burger chain. If I had to choose, I would still go with Five Guys (the heated debate), but In-N-Out is definitely not a bad choice. I prefer Five Guys larger burgers and I like their fries better (Five Guys are thicker compared to In-N-Out). But it is definitely more of a preference thing. Five Guys is also more expensive - so In-N-Out is a less expensive choice. Both are much better than the cheaper chains though, like Mickey D's & Burger King."}
{"text":"Double Double with frys to go please!!!  Great burgers and food, not just for the price but as an overall meal. If this is on one corner and there are three other fast food burger joints on each of the other corners, I am going here.  Fresh cut frys and grilled onions on my burger, yup...I am in."}
{"text":"I could eat here all day long!  Expect nothing but the best here at this In N Out.  Double Double, Fries and a Strawberry Shake (or their pink fountain lemonade).  We're lucky to have one so close to work now.  Whenever we can't decide on where to go for lunch, In N Out is the universal solution!"}
{"text":"Service was super great! Ruby is super friendly and helpful! She even cleared the table as we ate and offered to take our pictures for us with out us having to ask!"}
{"text":"One word \"Consistency\" ...always the exact same product no meter what day or time it is.I love it"}
{"text":"First timer here (from Missouri where In-N-Out does not exist).  Ordered off the \"secret menu\" to get a cheese burger animal style (for no extra charge!) and a root beer float (again, no extra charge).  Root beer float was served just the way I would have made at home myself.  The cashier immediately greeted us as we walked inside.  There were only about 3 people working, all appearing to be in their young twenties, all working together without yelling, and all in a great mood.  So rare to find people that are excited to work in fast food- really speaks to the management here. Perfect experience!"}
{"text":"I love in n out! It's one of my favorite spots. I try to come here only once or twice a month. I'm not sure how healthy it is though but it's soooo good."}
{"text":"Always good burger if you can find one. Come in early or avoid the lunch or dinner crowd to get the best table. Simple cheeseburgers that's all I need. And fries...."}
{"text":"I had such high expectations for this place. Unfortunately it just doesn't suit my style when it comes to burgers. It wasn't too far off from Five Guy's. The double, double wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special either. The cheese fries looked AMAZING, so I decided to try them. They were just fries with a slice of American cheese melted atop; they sucked.   Service was great considering the amount of people that were waiting to eat. We received our food relatively fast and the order was 100 percent accurate. I would not go back, but I'm glad I got to try it.   Side note: my husband thought the burger was FANTASTIC, but he and I are on opposite ends of the burger spectrum?"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and fries were really good. They were very busy, but kept the tables cleaned and everything moving. Great place to go for a quick inexpensive burger!"}
{"text":"Double-Double animal style with well-done animal style fries!  Need I say more?!"}
{"text":"I freaking love in n out. Get your fries well done and your bun toasty. It's the best!"}
{"text":"So I am native to Illinois and have wanted to hit an In and Out Burger since the first time I saw the Big Lebowski in 1998. I have studied the secret menu and been filled with tales of deliciousness from friends who went to college on the west coast or people who have visited on vacations. Unfortunately this experience fell way flat of those in my dreams. This is a pretty  standard, slightly better fast food burger place that maybe was a trail blazer but now is just one in the crowd with places like smashburger, meatheads, whataburger, 5 Guys etc... I got a double double animal style. It was fine for a late night snack. But tasted pretty much like your standard griddled double cheeseburger with thousand island like spread on it. The fries were just bad. Soggy not very salty and the melted slice of american cheese solidified quickly at my table. Unappealing and not tasty at all. The chocolate milkshake I had was the best part. Super thick and was able to withstand the heat walking back to are hotel."}
{"text":"Ok so I am not really one to go out of my way to give a bad review, but this is worth my time.   My last visit at this location was about a couple weeks ago. I sat inside, I ordered my food and I always get my same order #2 no onions animal style I LOVE IT!!! I got my food and guess what it has onions on it.. so I say ok no big deal you guys are usually on top of it. I let them know and they remade it only to find this time it had no cheese so I had to have them remake it AGAIN. They didn't make an effort to make me feel better about their mistake, I just felt like I didn't matter and everyone else did. So I left contemplating whether or not I would come back to this location.  So tonight I gave it another shot, it's close and convenient for me too. I actually went through the drive thru this time and ordered my usual. It's my fault I didn't check the bag before I left, but when I got home my burger is smothered in onions.   Like any other person I love to enjoy my food how I like it. It's disappointing because I am in fear of going back to only go though the same process over and over again. I can see why this location is 3.5 star and the other locations are a solid 4. Next time I am craving in & out I will drive the extra miles to another location."}
{"text":"this by far is the best location ever! fast service and they always have their staff constantly cleaning the place! Everyone is always smiling and theres no better place to go for an awesome burger and milkshake!"}
{"text":"Getting tired of going here and being served a hard bun tonight the cashier was holding up the line our food was soggy only one guy expediting I won't be back I will cook my own burger soggy burger is not good I live less than a mile from here if my burger is soggy when I get home that means my order was sitting there probably as long as I sat in line"}
{"text":"It's In-N-Out so its an obvi 5 Star. For the first time I tried a few new things off the secret menu. My husband got his burgers protein style & they looked REALLY yummy! He also tried the cheese fries, and they looked really good as well. Love the vanilla milkshakes. They are always super busy; but the tables outside are usually empty. We come here every time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Fast service, good burgers, same as any other in-n-out. The know how to handle lunch time with out making people wait too long."}
{"text":"I want to like this place.  However, I've had it about five times, and I just don't get it.   I grew up on Whataburger in Texas, and to me that is the standard for good fast food burgers.  I do not get putting 1000 Island dressing on a burger?!  And I've seen some even put it on their fries there.  Disgusting.   And despite the fact I tell them no onions, I still taste onions on mine, every time.  It's like they take the onions off or they use the same knife to cut other veggies that they use to cut the onions, or they mix minced onions in the hamburger meat.  And I know they fries are fresh cut, but I'm not a fan of those either.  Now, I will say this for them, they have GREAT service and they are always super friendly and that's hard for as busy as they are.  I go in there for milk shakes from time to time now.  But I will trade every one of these In-N-Outs in Vegas for one Whataburger!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to In-N-Out when I'm in Vegas. It happily satisfies my craving for a grilled cheese sandwich, tasty French fries, and a chocolate shake. It's like any other In-N-Out where service is great but there's always a line. I have never been here where the drive-thru line is not wrapped around the building!"}
{"text":"this in-n-out is pretty big.  small outdoor section but an ok amount of seating inside.  any weekend evenings, there can be loads of people and people may have to wait.  service is friendly and super quick.  it is quite clear, just as it is with in-n-outs over here in ca, the staff is always hustling and always friendly.  the order we had was done perfectly and i wouldn't have changed anything about the experience here.    parking is adequate but can get crowded"}
{"text":"You will always want what you can't have.  Living in Florida, I am no where near one. So anytime I'm near an In-N-Out, I have to stop at least once... Twice if I'm lucky. We made the long walk from the Strip (wouldn't recommend walking, but if you do, go to Excalibur and take the sidewalk all the way down).   It was about 9 pm and there was plenty of seating. The restaurant was super clean with not even a fry insight on the floor. The cashier was so polite! You really can't beat their prices. Like $6 for a burger, fries and soft drink combo meal. Our food came out hot and fast. It was everything I've been dreaming of."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning when I went on 8/29. Would not recommend anyone to go to this location. Probably will never step foot in an in n out restaurant again."}
{"text":"Good burgers.  Very very long line and wait for food.  Allow extra time.  Drive thru very slow too.   Just prepare to wait either way. On the plus aise,  They did get my order right tho"}
{"text":"I was convinced, by the Man, to give In-n-Out a second try.  So, since we were in Vegas, we did.  We got there at Lunch Rush... and this location is right next to UNLV.  Be forewarned.    The place was packed in like sardines, with people oozing everywhere.  So.  We ordered.  Animal Burgers.  Animal Fries.    Waited about 15-20 minutes for our food.  (Seriously??)  I actually watched our burgers \"sit\" on the counter (there are no heat lamps here, people) while our fried were prepared.  For a good 3-4 minutes they sat there.    Suffice it to say this place could use some serious expo-of-food-organization help.  Anyway.  The food, for what is is ($7.50) was fine fast food fare, as it was the first time we tried In-n-Out.  The fries this time were hot, though, and tasted better under their onslaught of melted processed cheese slice, cooked onions, and thousand islan... Uh, I mean \"Spread.\"  Other than that?  It's a Fast Food Place.  They may rave about their \"Fresh Cut\" fries and their \"Never Frozen Beef\"... but I still wouldn't eat one of their patties on its' own, without the helping hand of a LOT of cheese, bun, and \"spread.\"  So.  It is what it is.  I'd eat it again, but I don't forsee any insurmountable cravings for In-n-Out any time soon."}
{"text":"I've been in countless conversations as a west coaster extolls the virtues of In-N-Out Burger; I then salivate awaiting the day I'll taste unparalleled burger excellence.  Today was that day.  I will say this; it's the best chain fast food burger you can get in America. Now, you must remember, it is still just a burger.  Imagine the $150 burger at Daniel; will the taste stand up to the anticipation?  At some point in the continuum, no experience can possibly meet the high expectations. I was past that point, but that doesn't mean that I can't recognize this fantasticness.  What really got me was the grease.    The grease dripping from the burger wasn't the solid grease you get from a burger at every other fast-food chain, it was probably 75% water/25% grease.  Since the patties were created with fresh, never frozen beef, you get this product.  That wasn't the only mark of quality I hung on to.  The tomatoes were more crisp than the lettuce most places, and the lettuce crunched like a potato chip.  As the pickles protruded from the sides of the sandwich, I began to ponder what I would have received if I'd ordered extra pickles.  The cheese was deli style; thick, substantive.   I ordered the fries well-done; my mistake.  They came out like potato sticks.  Not terrible, but just stick to the regular fries.  The Neapolitan Shake - I received it before my meal was ready and drank it in seconds.  Without question, the shake was the highlight of the meal.  More dense than the McDonald's and BK shakes, thinner than a Frosty; vanilla, chocolate and strawberry never combined to create such a simple taste sensation.  All in all, a wonderful place.  For the money, it is tough to beat.  But, does it beat Ben's Chili Bowl?  A Fenway Sausage?  No.    But for a chain . . . Probably the best bang for the buck out there."}
{"text":"Horrible experience with a employee named oscar,Me and my boyfriend go here in this location a lot,most of the time we eat inside but sometimes we do drive thru,I saw this particular employee counting change with his gloves and he never change his glove after counting the change while handling food..He was literally putting the fries in small little tray then press it with his dirty gloves,I'm so disgusted so I confronted him told him he is not gonna touch my food and he said he change his gloves all the time.But he just change his glove after I confronted him.i mapping that the manager will take action regarding this issue.we want our food to be clean."}
{"text":"Always good. You can't go wrong. The special sauce/spread is to die for. Small menu but that is what makes it good. Not a lot to choose from and not a lot to mess up!"}
{"text":"This one won't be long, but this place is so money!!! We went last night through the drive through and by the time we got back to the Palazzo it was a little cold, but this was to be expected. The best part was that the taste did not suffer at all. The double double is the way to go and if you feel like walking on the edge look on-line for the secret menu. Items like the animal will keep you guessing for days!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out Burger is reliably good fast food.  They may not have the absolute best burgers, but they are consistently good and always made fresh.  I'm not the biggest fan of their fries.  I know they are cut and fried fresh but I guess I like larger fries better - like Red Robin steak fries or Five Guys.   However, the shakes at In-N-Out are incredible and the service is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Food was fresh . The restaurant was A little crowded , but the service was pretty fast . Very reasonable prices, and WAAAAY better then spending $20 on a mediocre burger at the hotel ."}
{"text":"This is my first time ever being to an InNOut! Definitely worth the hype. They need to bring one to Michigan"}
{"text":"This In-N-Out is near and dear to my heart, half of my high school nights were spent here. It's always clean inside and out and the service is usually friendly. The pink lemonade is super refreshing and the fries are always great! The burgers however are somewhat of a rip off, they're tiny! I never noticed until I had to eat just a hamburger wrapped in lettuce because of a diet I was on. They do make a good burger, but most of it is sauce, lettuce, cheese, tomato and onions...not the meat."}
{"text":"This one is a good restaurant! I would rather go through drive-thru then go inside. This drive thru is very fast, I've never had to wait more then 10 minutes or so before I get my food. When they get busy they have 1 or 2 guys outside helping making the process faster.   I mean as for the food here, can't complain. Very simple menu. 3 items and you can kind of customize them how you want. Only burgers and fries on the menu. And shakes lol.   Number 1: double double with cheese Number 2: cheeseburger with cheese Number 3: hamburger  Burgers have onion on them and you can get your food \"animal style\" and that's their special sauce with relish and onion diced up. (It's really good)  Love in n out and always will."}
{"text":"After hearing how awesome in and out was, we finally decided to try it. We waited about 10 minutes to get our order, a cheeseburger with lettuce and tomato, and the special sauce, along with the fries. Yuck! The special sauce turned to be thousand island, and they just drenched the burger with it. The veggies were ice cold and soggy, which made the rest of the burger cold..and soggy... The fries were only luke warm and had no flavor whatsoever. I guess you get what you pay for.  Update: Decided to try them again. Figured maybe it was just an off night. Fries were hot and freshish this time, but just bland. Not awful, but not something I'll bother paying for again. Got the burger with ketchup and mustard instead of the spread. It was actually a pretty good burger, but it was still cold and soggy.  Upgrading it to two stars, simply for the good service and the fact that the burger COULD be good.  Still, Smashburger and Five Guys and Fries have better burgers, no doubt."}
{"text":"I have heard great things about In-N-Out burger so the expectations were high. To be honest, the experience reminded me of a 5 Guys. I will say the burgers were very good and the service was excellent. The place was jam packed with people in the heat of a Las Vegas night, and the service was quick and the staff were all very attentive and accommodating. Our one compliant was that our fries were cold and underwhelming. I rate it 3 stars because I wasn't blown away by my experience but the burger was decent. Good not great. Definitely a cheaper option along the Las Vegas strip and it is in a happening and cool area."}
{"text":"Great service as always. Staff here is ALWAYS on point from friendliness to quickness. Smooth transaction from register to eating.  The burgers tasted amazing as always and the animal style fries were perfect this time. Sometimes too much onion but always great.  I asked an employee for a rag to wipe a dirty table. She asked what table and came and did it for me. Things like that keep guests happy. Keep it up you guys. You are doing awesome.  If you are visiting this In and Out is a MUST try :)"}
{"text":"For the few times where my brother and I have gone directly to the Hard Rock Casino after I disembark from my flight, we always make sure we stop by here.  He doesn't eat the food anymore since he overdid it in his UNLV days, but I always insist that if I don't get some of this, my gambling will be salty for the rest of the trip.  If it's not my first meal, this has proven itself to be 100% true while the other trips have me go home even or ahead.  It's boilerplate to the other locations - the only differing thing is that this is not frequented by the throngs of tourists like the Sahara location."}
{"text":"Any follower of In-N-Out would recognize the red sign with yellow arrow from a mile away.  When I jog in my t-shirt, people don't comment on the paradox of running in a fast food t-shirt, but instead, comment on me torturing them with the fact that there are no In-N-Out restaurants on the East Coast.  So what does one do when they wear their threads bare?  Go to the company store.  This place has shwag out the wazoo.  Golf balls, t-shirts, jackets, cups, stickers, magnets, you name it.  You can get most of this online, but if you're in the area and don't feel like paying shipping, this might be worth it.  Unfortunately, this location sucks for two reasons.  First, it is right next to one of the busiest In-N-Out joints I've ever seen.  Second, the store itself is only as large as one shopping aisle at a grocery store and it's packed full of people and crap.  Now that I've done it once, I'll go to the website instead.  But you still have to see it so you know what you're ordering, I guess."}
{"text":"Great food as always - I have to have a Double-Double of artery clogging goodness - all animal style.  I swear these restaurants are a cult-following on the West Coast.  But it's one I'm willing to be a part of.  Even the Mormons or David Koresh doesn't have that kind of pull over me.  Definitely go with a Double-Double combo animal style.  If you really like the sauce and onions, you can animal style your fries too.  But that's a little bit too much of saturated fat for one lifetime.  However, this location is certainly busier than hell and picks up a lot of customers.  Steer clear during peak times if you can offset your appetite due to jetlag."}
{"text":"Very fast for not having a drive through and heavy traffic. Burgers were consistent and fresh like other locations!"}
{"text":"This is a good In N Out. But not the greatest location. The parking lot is next to Wal-Mart and line are long. They have messed up our drive thru orders several times so just check your bag before you leave. Other wise their food quality is good and standard to the average In N Out."}
{"text":"You know, I really don't see the allure. It's just another burger, I don't even like the fries, and I think Wendy's frosties are better than the shakes.  I understand that it's an old school burger place, but it's literally just like every other fast food joint. Just because they have a 'secret menu' doesn't make the food better.  Totally standard fast food fare, lines are way too long (though they move quickly), and it's pretty hard to get a seat in the restaurant.   Overall, not very impressed. I don't care if I'm one of the only dissenters, I'm judging on the overall quality of the dining experience, not the OMG IM AT IN N OUT BURGER!!!!!!!11one LOLOLOLOL"}
{"text":"I usually give the nod to California for the best In-N-Out spots, but this LV version along Eastern has completely won me over. This will be the same story reiterated countless others have told over and over: Animal Style. Hungry. Win.  This isn't the only In-N-Out in LV of course, just simply one of the best. Every drive-thru and dining in visit has been the same high quality, gut bombing, palate pleasing, quintessential fast food laden experience one could ever want. Double double with animal style or a 3x3 or 4x4 for the adventurous? Done and done. Skip the fries and shoot for a shake, the burgers here are the real story.  And like all good things in Vegas, it's open late. 1AM on the week days and 1:30AM for the weekends. They would dominate the late night crowd (as if they weren't busy enough) if they managed to stay open past 4AM."}
{"text":"After phenomenal In-N-Out experiences in Cali and subpar ones in Texas, I was initially nervous about the In-N-Out in AZ, more specifically Peoria. It is a slight notch below Cali, but certainly miles ahead of Dallas. Plus, I've learned that no matter what, animal style makes everything better. Yes, everything.  A double-double with french fries drenched in the animal style goo is always my go to and if I'm feeling extra saucy, I'll throw in a shake on top of it. I got all of the above here and while the burger was up to par, the fries and the shake were definitely under par. Dry potatoes and a hard shake made for tough consumption, but 1st world problems for spending less than $6 for a fattening meal would lead me to complain less and not more.  Service was pretty standard. Efficient, almost military precision in assembling my tray of heart attack worthy fast food. Impressive, considering how often they must deal with lines and rude tourists who know nothing about In-N-Out. What I still wouldn't give to have one of these in NYC ..."}
{"text":"I hate to admit it, but this In-and-Out joint does California proud!  The burgers are cooked to the point where I am almost in disbelief that its fast food.  The fries were just right, with just enough crisp and just enough sog short of being totally limp.  Its a good spot to stop at when the late night cravings scream from the fast food depraved belly."}
{"text":"Great food!     We had a party of 13 dining in.  Our order was spot on perfect.   And the staff was outstanding !"}
{"text":"My East coast family is fascinated, with In-N-Out Burger an I Phone photo op in itself I guess...... a bit of....tourist spot....kinda...... like an IKEA......(I forgot what it is like to live in a small midwestern town and the things that inspire people).        I love the fresh cut palm fritz very tasty.......and the milk shakes are good.  The lines are a bit long for me, and the menu small, but what can I say, but it is a must have for people looking for fast food that taste like well food."}
{"text":"Always quick efficient service. The food is always great! The staff is always friendly and caring. You can count on there always being a line inside and at the drive thru but they hustle to get customers taken care of and I don't mind waiting a while for good food and good service. They regularly clean tables and floors and the place always seems very clean. Only downfall is getting into their parking lot! It seems like you can drive right into their lot when you're in the shopping center but they are completely separated so you need to get on 83rd ave to get into their lot."}
{"text":"Normally great food.  Today went through drive thru and my cheese burgers were ice cold"}
{"text":"What's not to like about this place. My first experience with in-n-out was in Texas and they're just as good at every location I've been too. The service is great, they're always super busy but they get the food out quickly and obviously it tastes amazing! Every. Single. Time. I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"mmm the best (and for me the only) fast food burger place in vegas.  I am not a huge fan of fast food, I really like quality whether I am spending $5 or $50 and  In-N-Out is one of the few places which understands this. You can't really go wrong with there 3 menu items, hamburger, cheeseburger, and a double cheese burger. But thats pretty much about it. I dream of a day when they come up with a chicken sandwich, but hey I CAN dream right? Overall the food here is great, fresh veggies, actual potatoes for their fries, nothing frozen, and consistent quality make this a great place. I really do wish they mad more variety cause you are SOL if your friends decide on In-N-Out and you want something other than burger.  Also their service rocks! I know its weird to talk about service at a fast food restaurant but the employees here rock! They never get the order wrong, they are super nice, quick, and on top of getting you whatever you need. It really does make a difference.  If you haven't already, check out their secret menu which I am sure you can find on the internet. One of the worst kept secrets in the fast food world. Also keep an eye out for the random bible verses they have on all their stuff."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is really the only fast food burger worth eating. Like all the other locations, this one serves up the same fresh food and great service. Located right of the I-15, this location is probably the closest for anyone staying on the Strip.   There isn't much variety here so my order usually looks the same: double-double animals styles with a lemonade. Being so close to the Strip also means this place is always packed. After midnight you will see a flurry of taxi's clogging up the drive-thru and a line up to the door for dine-in. Thus this location usually takes a little longer than the other ones; something to keep in mind if you are on a time crunch.  Tip: they have a shop right next door you can purchase In-N-Out gear from."}
{"text":"I don't get it.  Seriously?  People *seriously* like this place?  It's like McDonald's or Wendy's, but with only 3 things to choose from on the menu!  If you have the time go The Original Hamburger Works and sit in comfort and have a real burger."}
{"text":"im glad i have you as neighbor!!! in-n-out rocks. great quality food and service is great. I will definitely come back to this location."}
{"text":"Can you ever go wrong with Animal Style? We love going West just for there burgers, fries and shakes."}
{"text":"The burger patty looked like the ones in my school cafeteria. I was pretty annoyed to get home to such a disappointing burger. At least the bun was soft, but very very greasy."}
{"text":"The hamburgers are juicy with an excellent taste. The strawberry shake was very good.   I should point out that once you order it takes a long time to get your food and that is because the grill cooks are extremely busy.  Also, I could not find an empty table to eat indoors, so I had to eat outdoors.  So be prepared to wait for your food.   The parking lot next to this place is very large, so parking is not a problem."}
{"text":"It's In-N-Out Burger. I dont think the menu has changed since I first had In-N-Out. Double Double, combo #1 is the only thing I ever get. Ever.   I walked in w/a few co-workers yesterday. The line was so long it wrapped around more than half the restaurant. Yet I was in front of a smiling cashier within 5-6 minutes. So Im ready to get my #1, which I did.   As the cashier tells me Im #33, I see another smiling cashier speak into a microphone looking for guest #4. I asked, \"Did you just say #4? She replied, \"Yes, are you number 4\"? Shit, I wish lol  So I sit down w/my co-workers and within 11 minutes from the receipt time, I hear \"Guest #33, you're order's up\"! I couldnt believe that at noon, in a packed In-N-Out, I waited in a long line and was served within 15 minutes.   For some reason, my fries were better than ANY other time I've had um. Normally, I dont like In-N-Out fries after 5 minutes. But for some unexplainable reason, I ate all my fries. Which is a 1st for me. Maybe they cooked my fries a little longer? I dont know, but I liked um. Of course my burger was awesome. Duh....   And if you've never been to any In-N-Out before, just order 2 Double Doubles to start. That's what I'd recommend. Dont be the guy ordering another one waiting another 10 minutes."}
{"text":"When I find a friend that hasn't been to In-N-Out, I know we're in for a fun outing.  I've taken dozens of people to this location for their first experience.  It's a regular stop for our http://BurgersByPhone.com crowd when ever we can get together"}
{"text":"So good!! Love the simplicity of in and out. Ordering protein style means I can easily make my order gluten free, and cheesy fries are a must. I wish they had in & out on the east coast where I live!!!!!!"}
{"text":"If I'm going to eat burgers or fast food I rather have In and Out. The food is just fresh and the fries taste like real potatoes! Surprisingly there was no line in the lobby when I walked in but the drive through was slammed! The burgers were fresh and tasty as always, I was just surprised when I asked for Mayonnaise they don't have any / carry any in the store! The prices are very reasonable and cheaper than McDonald's or Burger King for far better quality. There is plenty of tables inside the lobby and it is definitely not as busy inside as the drive through is."}
{"text":"We live in the east coast and we came to Vegas for the first time in May of 2012. This was the first time we had In and Out Burger. AWESOME!! Just perfect. It;s a shame that we don;t have any of these back home in NYC."}
{"text":"One thing I did not like about in and out is there fries and they told me to order the fries cooked light so order fries light and they come out like McDonald's fries butt the burgers are always good here. A double-double animal Style"}
{"text":"They always have good food here but it has the worst traffic flow I have ever seen At one if these places! The drive through was a compleat mess. People coming from all directions and having to block a road in order to get in line. They really need to change the way the drive through is. People were getting really upset!"}
{"text":"20 minute wait for one double double....? And no surprise that I get home and it's too over cooked to eat. This is the worst In-N-Out in the valley but it's the closest to my house.   This one needs a staff overhaul, the high school kids working here on a Saturday are too busy poking each other and telling secrets and giggling about how silly the secrets are. This is a business, there's an expected level of service to be provided. Let's try to step it up if that's not too much to ask.  I can't believe these fast food employees are demanding $15.00 an hour for this nonsense."}
{"text":"My local In-N-Out, and I most definitely love this location!  Located on Tropicana between Fort Apache and Grand Canyon, this location is nowhere near as busy as the other locations, especially the In-N-Out on Tropicana and the 15. The lines are shorter than other locations during peak hours, and is especially not too busy when it is outside of peak hours, which makes this location very desirable when you want a quick bite to eat. The service is always excellent with a friendly staff waiting to take your order and periodically cleaning the dining area. The food is as In-N-Out gets, absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"This is by far the busiest In-N-Out in Las Vegas due to its location. Even with the large influx of people, they do a great job of still working efficiently and hard to get everyone their food in a timely manner. There are other locations around the valley if you want to avoid the long lines, but if you want to avoid the long lines at this location, definitely come late night, past 11PM. The lines are almost nonexistent, and they do a great job at getting everyone's food. I love In-N-Out in their entirety and I get my standard 3x0 with both onions, ketchup and mustard instead with pickles, and an order of well done fries. They do it right, and continue to do so."}
{"text":"A lot of people should already know a lot about In-N-Out, but if you don't, I can give a short description.   The food here is known for it's freshness. Its food is never frozen, the potatoes are cut on site, and you'll see them making the burgers fresh. They have a \"secret\" menu that's not really secret, just not displayed. They are known for their animal style fries mostly, but they have different things you can do like add pickles, grilled onions, substituting the spread for ketchup and mustard. You can also order fries well done, which adds an extra crunch to your fries.   This location is one of the lesser busy locations, but can be decently busy depending on the time of day that you visit.  The service is fast and the store is kept clean. If you're in the area, take a visit!"}
{"text":"Moving here from CA. In n out never disappoints. And someone on the radio compared it to five guys.  Lmao. No comparison"}
{"text":"Love the consistency! Their professionalism should be the gold standard in fast food!"}
{"text":"As good as expected. They do offer protein style (no bun) which is done well. Negative - dusty dusty plants. I really dont like dust when i am eating."}
{"text":"went through the drive up window, person could not get my simple order of a number 1 with no cheese correct. Apparently he does not have command of the English language. I will not be back. when you hire folks make sure they speak English."}
{"text":"Best burger ever at a fast food restaurant. Had the double burger animal style, fries that were a potato when I ordered them( now that is fresh) and a medium bottomless medium soft drink. Burgers are never frozen. Wish they had one in Alabama. It would put the other fast good burger joints to shame. Highly recommend if you have the opportunity to visit one out West."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a low carb snack, maybe something to tide you over please try the flying Dutchman with a side of spread. And to kick it up a notch, ask them to make it with fried mustard. What you get is 2 meat and cheese patties that have mustard infused into the meat while it cooks. Sounds strange but throw a side of spread on that greasy, cheesy mess and find yourself eating the best carb-free thing you never even knew about. Tell 'em Mary sent you ;) btw don't be surprised if the order taker doesn't know what a flying Dutchman is. Just tell them to ask their manager to school them in that case."}
{"text":"Never been before..... Will be back I went with a In and Out veteran who helped me thought the written menu and the \"secret\" menu. My double double animal style with extra crispy fries was excellent. You can also get sides of their sauce in squeeze packs. We did the drive thru which was a bit of a line, but it moved. All fresh and tasty , thank goodness they are not back in Michigan"}
{"text":"Over rated dreck. Its about time we call a spade a spade. Come on people, its a mediocre burger joint with not a lot of options. The fries don't hold heat at all and are good for the first 45 seconds and anytime after that they are basically cold mushy potato chips. The burgers are alright but go to Dairy Queen and get the mushroom swiss burger or the Flame Thrower at DQ if you are looking for a fast burger. Oh yeah, the shakes are foamy crap, the ones I have had were barely chilled and gross. The animal fries my wife gets looks like someone threw up all over a plate of fries. No thanks."}
{"text":"Food is good as usual but it's always too cold in nearly every innout, including this one.  Vent is noticably blowing cold air , with a medium draft, on many seating locations in the restaurant.  So much so that receipts, napkins, hair are visibly moving."}
{"text":"2x i m coming to this store and 2x employee here after did something on the ground and never wash his/her hands .. i feel sick with this at first i told em one of the employe about it and she resolve the prob and now the second visit .. should i say something again ?!? I feel so disgusting.. i m sorry to say ..  This is only example at the photo i saw this guy moped the floor and fix his mop with bare hand and after that he server the guest on cashier take guest deinks with the same hands .. yes the same hands"}
{"text":"you come out here mid-day and the sun is out and the line is flowin out the door! but a great place to grab a bite after you've lost all but $5 at the casino.  what i enjoy most about in-n-out burgers is that there's basically three things to choose from: double cheese burger, single cheese, or hamburger. makes everything go faster without people deciding what to get.  and of all the joints i've been to - every in-n-out is very consistent in their products, the staff is always friendly and very energetic. if i find myself hungry at any hour of the day - In-N-Out is where i'll be!"}
{"text":"Went here at ~11:30am Friday - huge line - but they were relatively smooth at getting people In-n-Out.  I love this place - but I'm torn between 5 guys vs. here.  Anyhow - I'm glad they're easy access in Vegas to satiate my cravings - there aren't any on the east coast!  Bring the chain out east!"}
{"text":"Omg, the double double and their shakes are the best!!! Really, great burgers & shakes!"}
{"text":"I believe In-N-Out is the most overrated burger in the history of the world.  It's a bigmac with better vegetables.  Their fries have absolutely no flavor; I'd rather eat cardboard.  Are the burgers better than McD's and Burger King?  Of course, but that's like being proud of being the toughest kid on the chess team, or the most talented player on the Girls Basketball team. And compared to other locations this one takes forever.  The last time I was there a friend was in from out of town and had never had In-N-Out.  We were two of 6 customers in the entire place and it took 15 minutes to get our food.  After taking a few bites of his food his exact words were, \"why did we wait 15 minutes for this?\"  It summed up all my feelings about In-N-Out.  It's good for fast food (assuming you think 15 min is fast) but it's not a real burger.  Too bad, because it's insanely convenient for me to eat there."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been said about in and out ... however this one is super clean. The kids a really friendly. They are very fast so even if the line is long it really doesn't matter. Yummy burgers and I live the vanilla shakes"}
{"text":"Such good fries! And I love their burgers and I'm not even a burger eater usually.  If you like fries, if you like burgers, run don't walk to In-N-Out. But beware, if  you don't like burgers, there's nothing for you to eat."}
{"text":"I can't visit a state that has In-N-Out, without coming by for my beloved double-double animal style with chopped chilies. Fresh, inexpensive and delicious."}
{"text":"Took a cab over to In-N-Out Burger during my latest Las Vegas trip.  As a tip to those thinking of doing the same, while there is not a line of cabs lined up outside like a hotel, there does seem to be a relatively decent flow of cabs that come and go from the parking lot.  On to the food:  This is my second visit to In-N-Out.  I got a 4-by-4 with fries and a Coke on my quest to continually evaluate what is the best fast food chain burger in America.  This latest trip confirmed for me that In-N-Out is at least a half-step ahead of Five Guys.  It also confirmed for me, though, that In-N-Out is a couple of steps behind my personal favorite: Cook-Out (of North Carolina)."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their food is always on point and no matter how many times I've been here they ALWAYS get my order right.   My go to Sandwich is the double double with grilled onions and spread.  Mmmmm!   If I'm feeling really crazy I'll do the animal styled fries but I don't let myself get that crazy very often. Throw in a vanilla shake and you're in heaven!"}
{"text":"Shout out to the crews at In-N-Out Burgers! We mostly go to the location on Rock Springs because it was the closest one to us but we just moved into a new place and this location on West Sahara is literally right across the street. The sign is the main scenery out my dining room! Lucky us! Lol. Unpacking all day the past two days and this location has been working non-stop since 10:30am. I never have seen a never ending line in a drive thru! You all are machines!!!! Great work!"}
{"text":"What can you say - IT IS In-N-Out!  This place has always had great customer service and food.  Double Double, protein style, animal style!!!    Love it!!"}
{"text":"The food is great here, this is my favor fast food joint! The meat is never frozen and the fries are sliced from the potatoes the get in daily. This place is always busy but the burgers and fries taste so much better not to mention healther if a fast food place can be healther the another. There's not 12 different value meals just 3 nice and simple and they have milkshakes that are great too!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for this was the cheapest meal we had the entire time in Vegas - three options cheeseburger hamburger double - not hard- but goes with the name in an out- yes it's cheap but you can also drive to Fremont food is also cheap there"}
{"text":"I don't know if it's possible to write a bad review about Inn-N-Out Burger I had a very nice experience here on multi occasions. They have a very friendly staff and they do an awesome job while keeping the establishment clean. The quality of the food was amazing just as Inn-N-Out should be and this site sets a stellar example of what the Inn-N-Out food chain is about.  The price meets the quality and you can tell the employees really enjoy their job and are paid well because it shows while they're working and it makes a world of difference to the customers. I do frequent a lot of Inn-N-Out Burgers as I absolutely love the franchise as always my reviews are 100% honest if there is a bad review to be written I'll write it."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly. I'm not a big fan of their food though, but I will go there on occasion. I like how its a small menu."}
{"text":"Living in Wisconsin meant we have access to several McDonalds, Burger Kings, Hardee's, Wendy's, and Culvers on every corner... In-N-Out Burger is a totally different monster. Just one bite and you can taste how wonderfully fresh and flavorful it is. The menu is simple and easy to understand. Their not so secret menu is to ask to make it \"Animal Style\" which includes extra thousand island spread, mustard grilled patty, and extra pickles.  For a singe patty, add some fries, and a soft drink, set me less than $5 for a truly good meal. The cashiers were always smiling and energetic. The place was clean and seemed packed even on a Monday afternoon. Recommended for all walks of life."}
{"text":"alwayd good customer service. during lunch time its very busy but the line  moves quickly. i love the double double."}
{"text":"In-N-Out Burger, what can I say? It's awesome there! It's that one fast food area to me that just never disappoints me. The burgers are what really hit the target for me, and the fries truly hit their motto. Service is outstanding and it's no wonder why there's so many people who love this area."}
{"text":"In-n-Out Burger, why oh why aren't you in Boston...  Alas, I'd weigh several thousand pounds if you were.  Delicious, fast, cheap.  All you need to know!  Already drooling with anticipation of going back...  soon, I hope!"}
{"text":"Thank you, In-N-Out, for making fast food fresh and made to order. The potatoes here are not greasy (still fried, though) and have a different texture that remind me of potato sticks. I enjoyed eating their burgers before I went vegan. After going vegan, I can still get food from here...called a \"veggie burger\" which is basically all the fresh veggies inside a bun. Get it without sauce to make it vegan. Still very delicious with the toasted bread, believe it or not. It's such a welcome refresher from the other fast food joints that make have their food sitting around al day, and their food is super greasy I only wish they had an In-N-Out on the east coast!"}
{"text":"Fresh, juicy, and flavorful.  Be sure to get the double double to enjoy the full flavor of the meat and cheese.  Truly fresh veggies and I really like the sauce that resembles a homemade thousand island dressing.  The fries are standard issue julienned fries but are hot out of the fryer, crispy and just right salted.  This location was busy but not impossible to get a seat.  Everything seemed clean in spite of the crowd."}
{"text":"It's IN N OUT, you can't go wrong. Great food, great service."}
{"text":"Great burger, clean restraunt, friendly staff (during a super busy time! ) And the manager even introduced himself and attended to us. A+"}
{"text":"Nom nom nom.  Cheesburger animal style and fries.  Wish this was on the East coat."}
{"text":"The In-N-Out Burger on Rural Road & 202 East is always clean, bright, and staffed with friendly kids.  Fast food places aren't known for their well-spoken and friendly teenage work force, but In-N-Out always feels a cut above.    Their menu is very simple.  You can have a double cheeseburger, a cheeseburger, or a hamburger.  They all taste great, and the fries are made while you watch.    There's also an unwritten menu at In-N-Out that has developed over the years.  If you'd like sauteed onions, pickles, and extra sauce on your burger, ask for your burger to be prepared \"Animal Style\".  I know it sounds goofy, but the cashier will know exactly what you mean- and it's amazing.  If you're in the mood for a burger and fries, it doesn't get much better than In-N-Out."}
{"text":"The best burgers in town! Always a favorite, and if you're a tourist, this is a must stop place on your list. Add it along with the Strip and everything else. Animal style is the best on fries (don't prefer it on my burger). If you want to splurge, add an Neapolitan shake!"}
{"text":"They don't have these in NH, my brother-in-law is always going on about the In-n-Outs from his time in CA, so when I finally had the chance to try one while visiting family in Mesa, I was on it.  The place is clean, fun, well- managed, with conscientious employees.  I got a double-double with fries and some of that animal sauce.  Man it was good!  Most fast food makes me queasy afterward, not this though.  Too bad we don't have any in New England.  If you wAnt fast food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Another great lunch at In-N-Out Burger at the Linq location.  The service was fast even with a semi long line things moved quick.  The ice tea is always available and like anywhere good isn't sweetened.  The fries are always delicious when ordered animal style with cheese, grilled onion and special sauce (thousand island) on top.  It's nice In-N-Out finally has a location on the strip and the prices might be a little more than off strip but so much better than a lot of other places on the strip."}
{"text":"love in-n-out burger - I just don't understand, they have burgers cooking constantly, so why do I have to wait so long in the drive thru? this location is always friendly and clean. 5 stars if they can ever get me in n out in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"I don't understand why people go so crazy about In-N-Out Burger for. The burgers are ok and they use 1000 island dressing, they dont even make their own special sauce. The fries are actually terrible, they have no flavor and they are soft. When I eat a french fry I want it to have a crunch to it. Texture is a big part of a perfect bite. I just see nothing great about this place. If you want a good burger goto shake shack or smash burger."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need a quick stop for comfort food, this is always where I get my fix.  Have to have a #1 double double combo animal style.  It's always made well and tastes fresh plus the drive through moves fast.  Great service!"}
{"text":"My favorite burger joint, always have to get me a double double!  Went here through drive through to pick up lunch.  Simply ordered 2 double doubles, 1 animal style and the other protein style and they were lightning fast!  Cashier and food servers provided great customer service.  The girl at the window even asked if I wanted some water while I waited which was nice since its uber hot outside!  Like this In and Out location better than the rest."}
{"text":"Food is awesome but by far the busiest and longest waits of all In n Outs I've experienced"}
{"text":"I'm from California so I loooove In-n-Out. This is the closest location to my home in Tempe. It is definitely refreshing to find an open late night find that isn't Taco Bell.   Big ups to the manager, who I believe is the really tall gentleman, and if it's not-- he definitely should be one. He was very understanding and accommodating one evening when I came in with some friends after work completely exhausted. With a mild error in my order not being made timely, he was more than helpful in making sure my late order became a priority."}
{"text":"It pains me to give In-N-Out only 3 stars but I wasn't blown away by their burgers. :(   Being a burger lover, the topic of \"the best burger I ever ate\" always comes up and I would ALWAYS hear how good In-N-Out's burgers were. Well the time FINALLY came this past weekend during my Vegas trip to taste the mighty In-N-Out burgers. I was so excited that I convinced my friends to have our taxi driver swing by the drive thru straight from the airport (thx for the tip btw fellow Yelpers!). I had done my research and decided to order a cheeseburger (animal style), fries, & a drink. The trip to the hotel was a painful one since I decided to wait until we got there to devour my meal. Once I bit into the burger, my heart sank - it was just ok. My friends advised that perhaps it was due to the fact that I had hyped myself up so much. Maybe during my next West Coast trip I'll give it another try, but for now Shake Shack & Five Guys' burgers still reign supreme for me!"}
{"text":"A and I love the burgers here and they did not disappoint! The service was exceptionally good, with a waiter bringing our order to us the first time we visited and it was super crowded. The second time we came, we were a bit inebriated from the high roller so the burgers really hit the spot. When we came around 6, it was pretty empty so don't come around lunch time if you don't like crowded places. I ordered my usual cheeseburger and fries animal style, which comes with grilled onions."}
{"text":"My husband and I had kept this all time classic place for the last day of our time in Vegas. We took a cab as it was a good 20 minutes drive from be strip where we were staying and spent most of our time at, and it was totally worth it!! In and out screams old world charm with it s neatly wrapped burgers and fresh hand cut fries, and a big sign board which is hard to miss. We went all the way and got two orders of the animal burger with animal fries and a medium drink. Our total bill was $18 which wasnt bad at all for the quality of food we got! A person ordering before us went REALLY specific with his order (wanting 6 slices of tomato, medium grilled cheese with well done patty etc etc) and the server was more than happy to oblige, taking his demands on with a smile. A big 5 for the service and the same for food!! Miss having it on the East coast!"}
{"text":"Tastiest burger anywhere. Super friendly staff...Brenda was great. Janice was cleaning, training and smiling all at the same time. Great experience  :)"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location since I was in high school, and it is really one of the best fast food joints around. They seriously have the best service, everyone working there always seems to be in a good mood and are able to move quickly which is great because it is busy so often.  As a vegetarian, the grilled cheese on the 'secret menu' is a personal favorite. I love the sauce they use on there, so tasty. I also love the animal-style fries. They are a mess haha but so good. I used to not be a big fan of their fries, but they have definitely grown on me. Not my favorite fries around, but still pretty good, and fresh! In-nN-Out is the best place to come for a fast tasty meal and great service."}
{"text":"Need I say more...it's In & Out Burger. Smash Burger, McDonalds, BK, Fat Burger, And Five Bros Burger don't compare to In & Out Burger."}
{"text":"What more can I say besides in-N-out is the shit but this one is always so slow they take forever to get the line down"}
{"text":"This is where dad got his very first taste of In n Out cheeseburger. I was excited for him.  He said it was just okay. (what the hell is wrong with him?!?)  My hamburger meat tasted fresh and juicy. I loved my well-done fries. Mom even polished off her cheeseburger with gusto AND she hates fast food, okay?   Also, friendly service from Scott at the counter. I can always count on In n Out as a much better fast food choice than McD's and I'm glad I can get my fix even when I'm not in California."}
{"text":"since i moved out here i will say that In n out burger definitely has the best burger for fast food but there fries on the other hand i got some plain fries from with my burger and they were eh they could have been cooked longer but overall it was a good meal i enjoy coming to this location"}
{"text":"Love their double double burgers animal style and their animal fries.  Daughter loves the grilled cheese. Gotta try their lemonade too!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out Burger never fails to get your quick fix for a great burger. Nothing like a 2x2 to make your day go better."}
{"text":"It's In-n-Out.  What else do you need to say?  Good food.  And I'm sure they pay their staff decent compared to other fast food joints since they are able to attract and retain helpful, friendly people who you can easily communicate with,"}
{"text":"I'd give this place 10 stars if I could. The service & food are consistently excellent. I ate here daily for two weeks straight once, but I'm sure others have beaten that! Other than Whataburger, this is the only other burger I eat. Also, the fountain drinks here are better than bottled & canned sodas (not watery like other fast food restaurants)!! Delicious every time."}
{"text":"My friend from LA was always raving about this place and when I went to Sin City and saw it, had to try it!  I got the double double animal style and woo-hoo it did get the animal in me out and about. It was juicy and I was satiated. I didn't care for the fries and the drink sat in the rental car for 24 hours.   If you see this spot anywhere in the US and want a nice bag of grease, pop in and try one."}
{"text":"Burger was perfect and crispy at the ends.  The sweet potatoe fries were also very good and different.  Flat crinkle cut.  Yummy after a long night."}
{"text":"This was the first taste of In-N-Out I ever had during a trip out west-solo-back in 2003.   Just a young pup who was lucky enough to have the coolest cab driver in the city, he took me on a out-of-towner tour of this great town (sounds like the start of a bad movie but really wasn't; I'm still around to tell it) which led to the final stop at my request: In-N-Out.  Not used to waiting for fast food since I've never been to this establishment, the cab driver even held the meter for me.   Sorry to say it was not a wild and crazy Hangover-style time in Las Vegas, but this was a highlight (that sounds sad to some of you all, I know).   Now that I have access to In-N-Out, it loses some of its cache, but nonetheless, I fondly remember this Las Vegas location.   I think the phrase 'you never forget your first' fits in well here. Cheers-"}
{"text":"We love in-n-out in Mesa and are always pleased with the cleanliness so assumed all were the same. NOT! Had to clean my table and the floor was littered and dirty from spills. Will avoid in the future."}
{"text":"Everything I asked for and just a little bit more.  I'd waited years to experience In N Out for myself and let me tell you this visit did not disappoint.   I had the number 2 cheeseburger meal, animal style, with fries and a drink. The meal was served logically and there was a lot of food. $6.11 for all of that? Okay.  My only complaint is that my visit was during a Saturday evening dinner rush and there was only one cashier working. It took forever to place my order!   Overall, great experience. Can't wait to get back out to the West Coast to get some more of this greatness that actually does live up to the hype. Next time - definitely animal style on the fries, and a shake."}
{"text":"Can someone please tell me what's the who-haa on this place? Just a very regular burger with fries.  Counted 21 cars ! In the drive thru....wow."}
{"text":"I love in-n-out always but the service was so amazing tonight I had to post a review! Gabriel was the best employee I have ever seen! He was so sweet and helpful! He brought us our food, checked in on us, and cleaned up for us! He did it all with the best attitude. Always love in-n-out and their employees!"}
{"text":"For fast food this sets the standard and this surprisingly uncrowded location delights! And for the love of God, ALWAYS GET ONION ON YOUR BURGER,"}
{"text":"the line can be 10 cars deep and i'll still wait because the staff and service is so fast, they will get you in and out in a jif.   i don't eat the burgers there, but i do enjoy to occasional chocolate shake, delectable fries, and their animal style grilled cheese. SCRuMP! =)  the menu is short, sweet, and simple. because there isn't much to chose from, it makes anyone's selection a breeze. if you want great all american fast food, in and out is the way to go."}
{"text":"What can you say bad about any In-n-Out???  This one is great, just like all the others.  One note though...this one did mess up two of my orders, its just worth noting because its the ONLY time that any In-N-Out has ever messed up an order.  I've never even heard of that happening.  It was their first month so I'll give them that though.  Still 5 stars is a must for the cream of the crop in burger joints!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start. This is my favorite fast food restaurant. The food is fresh and fabulous! The staff are always fast and friendly! This location was packed but, hey! It's Las Vegas what do you expect. It was still clean and we got our lunch in under 10 minutes. If you've never had In-n-Out you don't know what you're missing"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite fast food burger joints. Everyone knows about the Animal Style, but it's never on the menu. The burger is great, but the fries are below average (without animal style). The first few bites makes me feel like I'm in heaven, but it gets old pretty quick. Maybe it's just too much sauce. I don't know.  The concept gets 5 stars, but I'm only going to give it 4 stars. The biggest issue for me is the wait. I've waited as long as 45 minutes before. I think this family owned business can use an efficiency lesson from McDonald's or Chipotle or Jimmy Johns. Ridiculous! Did they just kill the cow after I made my order?"}
{"text":"Nothing special. I could possibly make this as well. Not bad, but not great. People should learn how to cook, then they will see it's nothing hard to make."}
{"text":"Delicious. Period.   Something that is so simple yet so good! I don't think I can ever get sick of it.   Not sure what else to say about it."}
{"text":"I'm from Socal and this In-n-out is honestly no different than any other in n out. Besides the fact that it is WAY more crowded than the one located off the strip. My friend wanted this instead of tacos el gordo, I was so sad. I guess the location was convenient because it's in the same plaza as the LINQ. It's actually right next door to sprinkles.  I got the double patty w/ cheese protein style and fries. The food was good, my burger wasn't all soggy and dripping with juices like other places. The fries were fresh and crispy.  I docked a star because it's like a massacre in there. The restaurant is so small and there was A CRAP TON OF PPL. You literally have to stalk for a table! It's so awkward standing next to someone half way finishing their meal so that you can get their table when they're done. The wait for food wasn't too bad considering how many people were squished inside this tiny restaurant. A lot of others had to get outdoor seating and even took over Sprinkles' outdoor tables."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh, fast service, clean seating, and friendly staff.  My only comment,,, why don't they move forward to chicken burgers????"}
{"text":"In n Out is well known because it is just the BEST fast food burger EVER! I love the simplicity of their menu but at the same time you can customize your experience with the sauces that they offer.  Their fries are fresh, burgers are super tasty and the shakes are on point. You can never go wrong with In n Out!"}
{"text":"I know, I know. Another In-N-Out Burger review. I have reviewed some in California and now Vegas. But here we go again. The food is so good it is repeat company review worthy.  Came here after a mall and unfortunately after a football game. It was crazy busy so we decided to eat in the car. I ordered the usual #1 double-double with grilled onions and a lemonade. I pretty much inhaled it and didn't speak to anyone for the 5 minutes it took me to eat it. They got our order right even when we had 7 people to order for and some of us ordered it with grilled onions, regular onions, no lettuce, only tomato, yada, yada, yada. Good job! Always a pleasure and always a necessity when visiting.   The great thing about this location is that it is right next to their brand store. My pops bought me an In-N-Out beach towel and my husband picked up a shirt on sale. Hawaii people are major fans so these things are awesome.  In-N-Out is a must and this location is pretty busy but worth the wait."}
{"text":"What can be said about In & Out, doesn't matter which location perfectly consistent every single time. With that being said the only downside is crazy long drive through waits, even if you go inside it's also packed with people. That's the only reason for my Four Star Rating!"}
{"text":"In-n-out is all about consistently great quality burgers at an affordable price. One of my favorite places to get food fast. I also love the iced tea. There is often a wait, so I usually try to determine if it's quicker to go in or wait in the drive thru. I love that I can get my burger protein style (no bun - lettuce wrap instead)   Staff is always friendly and attentive. I don't think I've ever had a bad experience in all my years of In n out eating.   Animal fries are yummy, but I don't like the grilled onions, so I usually just get a side of spread and dip my fries in that."}
{"text":"In-n-out is all about consistently great quality burgers. One of my favorite places to get good food fast.  I usually order a cheeseburger with no onions, add pickles, protein style. But sometimes I'm craving something a little more fattening (usually after a night of drinking, and I opt for the French fries animal style (no onions though) So good... so bad... but sooo good!!!  This location can get pretty busy during lunch time.. But that is to be expected. They also have great fresh brewed iced tea.  Staff is friendly!"}
{"text":"Same like other joints in CA.  But less busy Clean in dine area n bathroom Fast order n repeated the order correctly Foods prepare fast"}
{"text":"I mean, can you ever argue against In n out? I've been to this location for years and always get great service. Very friendly staff, sometimes when you dine in, they bring your food right to your table. I love the fact that In-n-out does not offer franchising and keeps the business an old (now a large) family business."}
{"text":"Good consistent quality. Simple business model. They only sell three different burgers and they do it very well."}
{"text":"This location is always on the ball! The drive-thru always seems to be packed but moves very quickly. The ingredients here are always fresh, your food order is always double checked before you get it, and no matter what time of day, your food is always served to you with a smile. Among their well known 'secret menu items' I had recently found out that if you are a fan of their shakes you can order one 'neopolitan style' which combines vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry all into one!"}
{"text":"Just like any other In-N-Out, busy as usual but never disappoints when it comes to the food. Plus, I enjoyed how generous the drive thru lady was. I asked for one spread, but she gave me two. Also they gave me more than enough ketchup packets which I enjoy since other fast food stores get stingy with the amount they give."}
{"text":"I love eating here! The burgers are the best. Always getting animal style fries and on the burger. Yum! Also a strawberry shake. I'm in heaven. Happy for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"We love In and Out. This place makes AWSOME burgers. Super fresh, super tasty, great prices and pretty fast!! The staff is always energetic, friendly and helpful!   Can't go wrong eating here!! Outside seating too!  Lots of parking and clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"Honestly I was expecting wonders from this place but it was alright. I had the fries well done and it was amazing but regular fries were ok. Got cheese fries which took extra 10 minutes longer than my bfs order of fries all to see it was a melted piece of cheese which hardened immediately. Shake was okay"}
{"text":"For the price, you can't beat the burgers at this place. Always fresh and hot. Not a lot of items on menu, but their burgers are better than those at many places where prices are two or three times as much. I'm not a huge fan of their fries, although I've watched them cut and fry the fresh potatoes--don't know what it is, but the texture of the fries is not over-the-top, but they are all right. Can't get a better burger at this price, though....The place is spotless and the staff friendly. Sometimes gets quite crowded inside at lunchtime, though. It's worth it for those burgers...."}
{"text":"So this review is a culmination of the countless times I've been here, and it all started many years ago when I was a student at UNLV.    When I was a student, the proximity to campus was fantastic.  And I don't know if it still exists, but there used to be sneaky-ninja parking behind the restaurant where I parked my car regularly and was never towed.  I am sure I went at least an entire semester without paying for on-campus parking because of this sneaky-ninja space.    Also when I was a student, the affordability of this place and the fillingness (I'm not sure if that's a word but you get my meaning) of the meal was super appreciated.    I can honestly say that I do not have any recollection of having bad service here, whether drive-through or dine-in, and again, that's going on many (many) years of coming here.   The food always tastes fresh.  While the actual menu items are limited, the 'styles' are varied.  Check out the not-so-secret menu (per your favorite internet search engine) and you'll know what I mean.    Me, I'm a tradionalist.  Double-double with grilled onions, light on the sauce, with fries and a Dr Pepper easy ice.  When I'm looking for a tasty burger-and-fries, I will default to this tried-and-true In-N-Out burger."}
{"text":"If you like basic bland burgers that you could probably cook yourself by buying those pre-shaped beef patties and slapping them on the grill at home (topped off with your basic condiments on a plain bun), then this is probably your kind of place.  Also, the fries are thin, overly salted, and basic.  I will give props to the shakes, which are very good and thick.  All told, it's a basic burger joint that so happens to be open at ungodly hours so you can get your post-buzz fix after partying all night.  At least the prices are reasonable..."}
{"text":"The drive thru line is normally a bit long but the food is usually given on time. A couple of my previous coworkers from another job work here so it's fun seeing them here. The only thing I noticed is that the entrance is inconveniently located. You can only access this restaurant by one street only."}
{"text":"Just what Sin City needed, a sinfully delectable In-n-Out Burger   Insider's note: Find out about their secret menu, it'll be worth doing the research.  I ordered my cheeseburger & fries animal style and now me tinks I'll never be able to enjoy any other burger/fries again!  Next time you're in Vegas, do the touristy thing that you wont regret the next morning.  Hit up the closest In-n-Out, it might just be the only thing you'll be able to talk about when you get back home."}
{"text":"Always come here for late night snacks, best burger ever and reminds me of my collage life in California. Friendly staff and delicious food"}
{"text":"In n out is in n out.  Not sure how to rate this.  I've never been disappointed here and the burgers and fries taste like all the other in n outs, as they should. 3 stars.  Nothing stands out about this location.  Staff is fairly nice."}
{"text":"Had in and out for the first time in years. Just as amazing as the first time! Went through the drive thru because I was in a rush but rather then giving my order to someone on the other side of a mechanical box a person greeted us in the line. That was great! Super friendly staff at both windows. I got a double double. Ingredients are so fresh. Simply amaze balls!!"}
{"text":"I love In N Out! Amazing fast food burgers, amazing fries especially when you ask for them crispy, and I can't complain about the fastness of the place and the cleanliness of most of the restaurants! I will always come back to In N Out, and I love getting these burgers whether it's a cheeseburger, double double, 3x3, or protein style - can't complain! Good prices too!"}
{"text":"Haven't had their food in a few years and made sure to make a trip when we were here in Vegas. Line went fast, and got longer as the afternoon progressed, but unfortunately there wasn't a lot of seating due to how busy they were.   Fries came out cold and onions were very hot. Burger meat was fresh and sauce was good.  Would not go out of my way to eat at tnhis location due to my experience, but would stop if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I live in CO, so when I visited Phoenix for a business trip, I had to stop by In-N-Out Burger.  Were all the rumors from my West coast friends true?  Pretty much.  There burgers are delicious and the toasted buns are a nice touch.  Even better than our Colorado fast food staple Good Times, not to mention cheaper and open later.  Keep moving Eastward, In-N-Out, we want you in the Rockies."}
{"text":"I just ate here last weekend, it was our first trip to Las Vegas and after  a night of checking out the Strip and having a few drinks we needed a place to decompress and grab a quick late-night meal. A local friend of ours suggested this place and wow, was he right on the money- you can't beat it after a night on the town.Loud, bright and crowded even at midnight, the food is fast, cheap and good. Our friend suggested a cheeseburger and fries \"Animal Style\"- I don't know what is  in that  Sauce but it tasted wonderful. Everything was fresh and just so damn delicious,  I  can't shut up about this place! You need to go there!"}
{"text":"First stop out of the airport... what more can I say!   There was one year, when my flight out delayed and I just missed the getting in for my double-double animal style, fries - also animal style, and my shake. I had to sadly watched the last costumers eating through the glass. Now I book my flights inconsideration of the closing time."}
{"text":"My husband is a Inn and out contisuer he loves in and out the service is fast even though there is a line all the way around the block. And the food was hott!. I absolutely love this inn and out!"}
{"text":"When you're looking for a place to eat with not much time but you're not willing to sacrifice taste just for a \"quickie meal\", In-N-Out is a great place to go!    Although many places claim they have \"The Best Burgers\" in town, the brutal reality is most places don't!! The coolest thing about In-N-Out; they don't talk the talk but they do walk the walk by delivering good eats consistently whether your in LA or Phoenix.    Their menu is smaller than most places and some peeps think they are limited to what they can order, but that just means they have not really experienced the true uniqueness of In-N-Out like a lot of us have ordering from their \"secret menu\"!!   My son usually gets a 1X1 with catchup, fries and a Neapolitan Shake ~ strawberry, vanilla and chocolate blended together.  My bride usually orders a protein style 1X1 burger with catchup & mustard and grilled onions with a diet.  For me, it's a 2x2 or 3x2 animal style with extra toast and well done fries!  DELISH!! The person with me today had a 5X5 aka; the \"take a nap afterwards\" burger with hot melty cheesy well done fries and black and white shake!  It looks AWESOME!  They have never got my order wrong despite me ordering something cooked a different way with each visit.  They have that cute red and white decor/packaging and include an inscription like \"John 3:16\" and \"Proverbs 3:5\", which is awesome!  So the next time you're ready for fast food, don't make the mistake and go to just any burger place, go to In-N-Out! Order something from their \"secret menu\" but don't tell anyone..."}
{"text":"In n out will always be a go to. Everything is so fresh. I'm so happy that they have a couple in Nevada because that would have been a sad thing to get rid of when I moved. If you want a cheap quick good quality burger this is the place for you. Oh and do yourself a favor and try the animal style fries."}
{"text":"This place is legend around the united states. I think I might cut my pinky off if it ment them coming to Florida. I'd probably eat here twice a week or more if I could. It gets super packed with hungry patrons trying to get the fix of their lives. Fresh ingredients and freshly cut friend. The sauce they put on the burgers are amazing. If you're in the area, you owe it to yourself to come here. You're most likely to die of happiness."}
{"text":"Not much to say that hasn't been said by others. This is your run of the mill In-N-Out, but run of the mill In-N-Outs are fantastic.  I got a burger, fries, and a shake. The burger was exactly what I expected--really tasty and satisfying. Fries were great and the shake was the best shake I've ever had. They get it so creamy--not to the point where it's hard to drink, though.  I wish we had these in North Carolina. Best part of the west coast!"}
{"text":"In n Out is my favorite fast food burger place.  They're always delicious, fresh and loaded with tomato and lettuce - which is how I like them.  I always order my hamburger animal style.  And most of the time I try to get someone to share a fry with me cuz I don't want to pig out and eat the entire thing (which I would have no problem doing believe me)!  Their fries are the tastiest!  The service is always very friendly and quick and they've never once messed up an order.  Their shakes are fucking great if you're in the mood for one.  I Love In-N-Out... and if it wasn't so horrible for you I would eat there way more often!"}
{"text":"Burgers are cold when i get them home and live just 2 mins away. They will always, always get my order wrong. My burger is never right. I swear its the most annoying thing ever. I hate driving back each time just to request they fix my order. I dont know whats going on behind that counter but they cant get my simple order right to save their lives. If you can make the drive down to san tan mall and go to that in-and-out."}
{"text":"This is my childhood go-to place (being raised in So-Cal...its either you like In-N-Out or they take you out back and lynch you). Good thing the quality of their burgers hasn't changed much. By my past reviews you know I don't scrimp on calories (if you are going to eat out...eat out) and In-N-Out is NO exception.   For those of you coming in from anywhere but CA, AZ and NV (maybe they are in Utah and Oregon now...I don't know)...you are in for a real treat. The menu is simple and ordering is as easy as 1, 2, 3 (i'm not just saying that #1 combo is a double double, fries and a drink, #2 is a cheeseburger, fries and a drink and #3 is a hamburger, fries and a drink). However...there are ways to keep your burgers not boring...you guessed it...i'm talking about ANIMAL STYLE (roughly translated...extra sauce, extra cheese and extra grilled onions). My favorite meal (and probably one I would pick before I go and meet the Lord someday many moons from now) is a #1 animal style, well done fries (takes a bit longer but well worth the wait), rootbeer and if i'm feeling saucy (which is pretty common) I go for the vanilla milkshake.   This is a great place for your anklebiters too! They give the kids free stickers at the cashier and they will slice up a burger so they can share (just say you want a kids hamburger or cheeseburger cut up). Will always come to In-N-Out because its tasty, cheap and its just what I do."}
{"text":"I was so happy when I found out they opened an In-N-out that is super close to me. Their drive thru is convenient and although they are always busy, the service is pretty quick. I had a cheeseburger and fries as usual while my boyfriend ordered a double double and fries. We loved our burgers... although fries were a straight up cold, definitely wasn't fresh. Now I realize that the last three times I've had in-n-out it was just always \"okay\". Not sure if just other locations are better."}
{"text":"They serve a really great tasting burger and fries, are usually very clean, and all of the people who work there are friendly.  They also have a nice outdoor eating area with tables and benches, great for good weather days.  I only docked 1 star because of the location of the restaurant.  They are in an enclosed parking lot on a very busy street corner, 83rd Ave and Bell Rd, making it somewhat of an ordeal to enter and exit.  And, by 'enclosed parking lot' I mean that you can only enter and exit it from 83rd Ave and not from Bell Rd nor from the neighboring shopping plaza.  Literally, you can only enter by driving north on 83rd Ave., and you must U-turn if coming from anywhere else.  Sometimes the traffic is just horrendous, making it even worse.  I've seen some people just park in the shopping plaza and jump the little wall to avoid these traffic issues.  Anyway, the entrance/exit is a bit of a pain, but it's worth it for a great burger every once in awhile.  If you're a first-timer, be aware that they really have only 3 food items:  a hamburger, a cheeseburger, and fries.  You can, of course, customize these items with the available toppings or get a double or triple burger, etc.  They also have a not-so-secret, secret menu...just google it if you're interested.  For drinks, they have shakes and fountain sodas.    Overall, 4 stars for yummy food, clean space, and great customer service!"}
{"text":"Animal. Style.   I see you baby, slathering my cheeseburger with special sauce and pickles and onions. And oh God, is that mustard in the burger?   How dare you! To think I would ruin such an amazing creation with a tomato or lettuce. No such healthy stuff here. Puh-lease.   Oh and the way I pour that Root Beer. Oooh baby, that's it. So refreshing.   Why do I make your fries so limp, baby? If I could change one thing about you, sugar, just crisp up those fries... For me?   We don't have to fight, just hand me that stack o napkins and everything will be all right. You know I love you.  Animal style."}
{"text":"Great location like all in-n-outs.  Still have yet to ever have an in-n-out mess up my order.  Quality is good and the same as always."}
{"text":"Great fast food burger for an affordable price. Restaurant was clean and staff was friendly"}
{"text":"Crowded, as they usually are around lunch time. They were swamped and there was a long lag between customers leaving and tables being cleaned.... but I 'm not going to get too picky about that. The extra long wait time was a bit irksome. 15 to 20 minutes to receive our order. We should have went through the drive through. My burger ( a 3by3, animal style) was satisfying. My lunch companion was satisfied as well, so I know we 'll be back. Maybe just not at this location."}
{"text":"I love their cheese burgers! I like both the regular & animal style. They even had a lettuce wrapped burger for those with special dietary needs. I don't really care for the fries so much though. I stop by whenever I'm visiting Arizona."}
{"text":"Tonight after my boyfriends bands show we came to get a bite to eat. Everyone knows in n out is delicious and busy 24/7. It was slow when we came in and I ordered animal fries without spread. I was with a group of 8 people and was the 2nd to order. All of my friends and about 15 new guests all got their orders before mine and I was getting a little hangry at this point lol. Zachary ho was the employee who took my order and he was very Efficient. I let him know I still hadn't received my order about 25 minutes after the fact, and even though he was working register he stopped to go make my order personally while remembering my adjustments. Obviously, s**t happens and they're bound to make mistakes so only one star off for that but Zachary's customer service was too notch and I had to leave the review for him. If only they allowed tips here."}
{"text":"How can someone not love in n out?  Their burgers are so good and always cooked perfectly.  The fries and shakes are also super yummy.  Remember they have a secret menu: protein burger, animal style and more You can even get a root beer float  They are always busy but worth it"}
{"text":"Had to stop here the first thing whenever I come to Vegas! We don't have in-n-out in New Mexico. Even tho it's just a simple cheeseburger/hamburger, but it's delicious. From the buns to the veggies. Everything made fresh. Kudos to the staff at this location, especially this location!! They are busy and they are fast!! Their teamwork and communication are great, they get people food \"In-N-Out\". I've been to other places, nowhere is faster than this place."}
{"text":"Eh.  I don't understand the In-N-Out cult following.  I've tried, but I don't care for their burgers, I don't care for their fries.  It's OK, at best, as far as fast food goes.  I'd rather go somewhere else for a real burger."}
{"text":"Not much to say but yum. Quality was great. My burger was fresh and hot and the fries are always awesome. We don't have one in Hawaii, so I always try to stop at an Inn n out while on the mainland.  I prefer everything plain and untainted by the animal style that everyone loves so much.  Cheap, fast, and good, nuff said."}
{"text":"Best burger in the fast food circle by far . Yes I said it :)  The ingredients are fresh and the prices are right."}
{"text":"I don't know if I had higher expectations but I wasn't impressed with the food. It's just a regular burger and fries. I had them both animal style and it was SOO heavy in sauce.  Maybe it was the way it was made this time. Normally when I have inn n out in Cali, I can't help but go mm mm with every bite.  This time it just didn't hit me the same way. The fries were stale and the grilled onions or whatever they put on it was overcooked so it had a weird taste. The chocolate shake was like chocolate cream.  This location is very busy and the lines can get long. Remember, this is close to the strip and some people have NEVER had it before so they don't know how or what to order despite the simple meal 1, 2, or 3 menu right above the cashiers."}
{"text":"I always go to this in and out burger. It's one of the best burger joints in the area I think. In and out burger is my favorite burger place actually, always fresh and great service. If you haven't tried this place you need to and get grilled onions on the burger so yummy."}
{"text":"So busy! Prices are a bit more than California, but it is on the Strip so that could be why. Their water cups are flimsy they bend and break easily, so be careful. The food was good, but it is a chain restaurant so that is kind of a no-brainer."}
{"text":"Went after a very strong recommendation from a friend - and oh boy - totally worth it. Ordered the entire menu between the two of us and despite the burgers being on the slightly smaller side very well worth the price and delicious! Service slightly slower than average for a fast food but the food was worth the wait. Milkshakes are very thick and yummy! Currently my #1 fast food choice!"}
{"text":"It's the best of the fast food hamburgers.  I'm not crazy about their fries they're never done enough and I always forget to order them well done.  For the food, I'd only give them 3 stars but they earn the extra star on customer service.  The last 2 times I've gone through the drive-thru they have a real person taking orders.  I love this!  So much better than talking into a speaker.  I'm sure I'll be back next time I'm craving a quick burger."}
{"text":"It's In N Out........what more really needs to be said??? If you haven't been to In N Out you're obviously not from The West Coast where In N Out is a staple of burger life.  All of the food is prepared fresh and I love the tomatoes and lettuce they use.  The service has always been friendly and enthusiastic. God forbid I ever move somewhere where they don't have In N Out."}
{"text":"Give me a Double Double with Extra Extra Extra Extra EXTRA grilled onions and I'm happy camper. Their burgers are always freshly made to order and tasty. Despite some people who hate their fries I like them more and more each time. Again made fresh from fresh sliced potatoes.  I don't know where they get their tomatoes from but I've loved them ever since I was kid a really helped me get over my dislike of tomatoes.  Didn't I mention that their milkshakes are killer too???? I really don't know what I'd do if I lived somewhere where they didn't have In N' Out Burger. Guess I'll be west coaster for life."}
{"text":"Nice friendly staff and great food I wish we had an In and Out Burger in the east coast"}
{"text":"You just can't beat the burgers and fries from in-n-out. Everything is made fresh  and isn't frozen or microwaved like most fast food places. To this day, this is the only fast food that my grandma would eat when we're on a road trip or want to get something to get on the go."}
{"text":"Great food best burger in America. I can't think of a better place to eat. Only con is that lines are long but that is expected when you come to in and  out."}
{"text":"3x3, mustard grilled, no salt, whole grilled onion. Fries, well done, animal style. Some employees don't know their own menu, these kids know the \"secret\" one no problem."}
{"text":"The food is always so good. I love the simple menu. Double double with grilled onions does it for me. The shakes are very good as well. This is a very busy location but the wait is never that bad. Thank you for the great service every time I visit :)"}
{"text":"Who can hate a delicious In-N-Out. Anything less than 5 stars would be insane. My favorite meal is a 4x4 with peppers inside, fries well done and a vanilla shake. Extra spread to go with burger and you have perfection!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've had In-N-Out Burger but I've been reading the hype and had to try it again. I ordered a 4 by 1 thinking it was one patty and 4 slices of cheese, but apparently I got that backwards. The dogs appreciated that mistake!  The service was great. They really seem to take pride in their small but specialized menu. It was good but I think Five Guys makes a better specialized-chain burger."}
{"text":"In N Out burger is your better than average fast food burger. It's not quite a gourmet burger but it isn't trying to be. Everything is fresh and tasty. The service is Swiss-watch efficient and really something to behold. Prices are reasonable. Not budget but not premium."}
{"text":"Oh, man.  What can I say?  3x3, protein style, no spread, ketchup instead, mustard grilled, whole grilled.    When I went the first time, I got a 3x3 protein style and animal fries.  I read the secret menu wikipedia article and that's when I came up with the first order in my review.  Clean, polite, good location."}
{"text":"Would have been five stars if we didn't have to clean our own table before we sat down. Otherwise all good."}
{"text":"Always a fan of In and Out Burger. I think they raised the prices recently cuz the burgers cost more now. I think everything cost a little more now. But the service was fast and honestly, it looks like any In and Out Burger. It was clean and food was good. I ordered extra onions but I'm not sure if they gave that to me. Oh well... still had a good time hanging with friends."}
{"text":"The first time I ate the fries, I hated it. But then, I got used to them. Now, they taste really good! I eat at In-N-Out Burger so much. Food is usually healthier. It's relatively cheap. And Service is pretty good if the employees are competent.  I eat pretty healthy and I eat a lot. The best thing about this place is you can eat a lot in a healthy way for cheap. So just protein style hamburger (the custom order where they replace the bread with lettuce). Then just add extra onion, extra tomatoes and extra pickles for free. That's like a salad in itself. And for how much? $2.11 with tax. Not bad. ;)  If you really want to pig out, then order the animal style fries. It's not healthy. It has cheese and dressing and whatever they put in there. Or a 4x4 and some fries and shake. It's good. Just not healthy. But I love this place!"}
{"text":"Sometimes, unforseen circumstances turn into dates with destiny.  I rolled into Vegas on a Saturday afternoon, just to visit my favorite cheesy reality TV locations (Pawn Stars and American Restoration, if you must know).  I planned to stay on the Strip for one night, and spend the wages of sin alone and unsupervised in a neon blur of whiskey and poker chips.  But souvenir shopping accomplished, I realized I was not in the mood to stay in Sin City as a solo, squandering my earnings and tarnishing my spirit in a land of debauchery.  Sin is more fun with company.  Instead I headed towards Death Valley, a better match for my mood.  And there, on the outskirts of town, where the concrerte meets desert, it was.  In-N-Out.  And I was hungry.  I had heard the legends.  Tales of mysterious lingo and off-menu items known only to the initated, the In-N-Out Illuminati.  I spoke into the speaker words I had been taught to remember, but did not fully understand: \"Double double. Animal Style. Chocolate Shake.\"  And life changed.  Forever.  Can we build one of these in north Jersey, puh-leeeeeze?"}
{"text":"Dear God, I never knew what the hype was about until I finally stepped foot into my first in-n-out. I get it.  The East Coast is apparently not worthy.   But it was amazing and this restaurant was super clean.   I don't really know how to review fast food other than taste, cleanliness, speed and friendliness, so five stars for having all the above."}
{"text":"In-N-Out Burger Overall  5 Stars  Gold medal - Cheese Burger Animal Style Silver medal - Fries Bronze medal - Great Prices  Only in Vegas where you can see a Inn-N-Out sign in neon lights!!!     This location has both dine-in and drive-through.  This is the In-N-Out that everyone sees on their way to Las Vegas.  I have never had a bad burger at In-N-Out.  My typical order: Cheese burger animal style with extra toasted buns, gilled and raw onions. Fries  LOVE IT!!!!!!   HAPPY BURGERING!!"}
{"text":"Best In N Out in Vegas.....fast service with it being next to UNLV.  They were crowed yet it took less than 5 minutes to get my order.  I will be going back to this place next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"The 3-Star rating is not for the customer service or the food, but for how packed this place can get. This has to be busiest In-N-Out Burger in Vegas. Possibly, the busiest that I've ever visited.   Expect the usual great tasting food and fantastic customer service. Nothing has changed about those qualities that In-N-Out is known for, but do expect the following:  - There are long lines that can stretch out to the door, but they move fairly quickly.  - Be prepared to wait more than 10 minutes for your food to be ready. This was not due to service, but due to the large volume of orders.  - Limited seating. Actually, there's plenty of seating, but it might be tough finding a spot; bring extra people to seat stalk and reserve spaces.  - Sticky floors and messy tables. Considering how this place receives a lot of traffic, I can imagine that it'd be difficult to keep it spic-and-span. However, the employees do their best to make sure the restaurant is cleanly.   My suggestion would be to visit another In-N-Out location. But if you're dying to have an In-N-Out Burger fix and don't mind the wait, then by all means give this location a go."}
{"text":"Worst drive thru line this side of the Salt River basin be prepared to wait. Be prepared to be stuck in traffic getting in and out... Pun intended AZ there is no out"}
{"text":"I really like in n out for my burger cravings. It's cheaper than other fast food joints, but more importantly, the quality compared to the others can't compare. If you want to pig out, I recommend getting the double double. Just the right amount of meat and cheese. I feel like anything more than that, the meat ratio to bun might be off. Hahaa. The lines can be long, but the staff are efficient and quick. You can't find a more organized fast food company anywhere. Imagine the lines that long anywhere in other fast food places? It would be chaotic and the building would be on fire and babies would be screaming, poop would be on the walls. ::sigh:: the horror....."}
{"text":"Animal style burger and fries! Amazing! Love how they try to speed up the ordering process on a very busy day in the drive through. Their fries are amazing and so are the milkshakes."}
{"text":"Siiiiiiiiiigh.   IN N OUTTTTTTTTT  This was a good In N Out, as far as In N Outs go.  The fries were probably some of the best.  And I love the burgers, nuff said.  Even if I didn't have the bad food experiences I had in Phoenix that weekend, this took the prize of being the best experience.  NOM."}
{"text":"I **heart** In N Out.  I will travel 3000 miles to have one.  Don't have much choice actually.  #Nom"}
{"text":"Had to try In-N-Out Burger during our vacation, how could you not? Solid burger, yummy fries.  I'm always down for a chocolate shake but I don't order them if I'm splurging on a burger, so had to skip that. Really loved the homemade bun for my regular cheeseburger. Toppings were fresh and tasty, next time I'd get onions too. Liked the outdoor seating in the sunshine. I've had better burgers, but as far as fast food goes this place would defintely come out on top."}
{"text":"\"Hey Betty, how about lunch at the In N' Out Burger?\" -- Fletch Lives (1989)  I cannot be in the vicinity of an INO and not get a Double-Double Animal Style... I need that sauce coursing through my veins. So my recent trip to Vegas, and a new INO right near the strip (but not within walking distance...no sidewalks), we had to go.  We pulled in right around lunchtime, and the line of cars was spilling out into the street - lucky there is a very large parking lot. We parked and walked in to an equally large line of people - but with 3 registers open, it moved quickly. We opted to take the food to go and eat at one of the picnic tables outside. Our numbers were 30 away when we placed our orders, but getting the food took very little time - so this is a very efficient location.  The food came out perfectly. Hot, flavorful, delicious! I also got an order of animal-style fries (highly recommend, but you need a fork to eat them).   They also have a merchandise store here - not tons of stuff - t-shirts, PJs, tumblers, magnets, etc. Cute and fun if you are big into INO."}
{"text":"Yummy burgers. Great staff!!!! Love the pink lemonade.it's always full and cold (never warm at this location). Great prices as always. I love getting the burger with a lettuce wrap instead of the bun."}
{"text":"You always hear from the West coast cult that In-n-Out is the best burger ever. I would have to humbly agree, the double double Animal style was outrageous! I really didn't know what Animal style was but heard it on TV. In-n-Out burgers makes Shake Shack seems like a poor relation. Sorry Shake Shack, In-n-Out is the clear winner"}
{"text":"I have traveled over 2,000 miles to come here. Well, that's not entirely true, but it's an added benefit that there just so happened to be an In-N-Out here. I love it. Unfortunately we don't have any out where I live on the east coast, I really wish they'd set up franchises. Until that point, I will have to travel back out west to get my fix.  This particular location experiences heavy traffic flow, and just after it opened it was starting to get busy fairly quickly. I'm not sure what it's like during a more regular lunch time, but it seemed like it was going to start getting hectic fairly soon.  I got 2 Animal Style Double Doubles (the only way to go) for my dad and I, and a side of well done fries, as well as a strawberry shake. I regret not getting the fries Animal Style also, but that's for another time. As always, the burgers were delicious as ever, and the fries and shake were great too. I look forward to coming back for more in the future."}
{"text":"No trip to the west coast is complete without a trip here. I mean you have too. Delicious , mouth watering so good its hard to have just one kinda burger place.  Animal fries here are good too even though I passed on it this visit. The line is long but it goes quick.   Also dont be confused or get upset when they call the numbers out of order it happens so relax you will sinking your teeth into a burger in no time.  Its vegas so swing by fat tuesday or Margerittaville  ( pick your poison ) grab a drink before coming here and grab a table outside once you have your order.   Enjoy."}
{"text":"In and out is the best fast food burger chain. Having grown up on the West Coast, I frequented several locations on a regular basis. Now that I live in the Midwest, every time I return for a visit, stopping here is a rite of passage. No matter how busy they are, the staff moves so quickly. Even in peak times, I've never waited more than 15-20 minutes. It's always clean and in top condition inside as well.  Although the menu is simple, everything is good. I go with the 4x4, which is not on the menu board. It's 4 patties with 4 pieces of cheese. Their burgers are so fresh, perfectly cooked, and well seasoned. The fries are also amazing, as they cut all of the potatoes in the store."}
{"text":"Consistently good.  Friendly service and clean restrooms are always a plus in my book."}
{"text":"Good food.  Friendly service and always neat and clean."}
{"text":"No wait, service was good, and tables clean. Only 4 stars cause soda was off a bit. Co2 to coke was off."}
{"text":"This was closest one to our hotel. It was super packed!!! But service was pretty fast and burger was just as remembered from my last time trying it for the first time."}
{"text":"Coming from Florida, I wasn't sure the In-N-Out would live up to the hype. People on the east coast have compared it to Shake Shack, which added to my skepticism. Shake Shack is okay, but it tries to be more of a fancier joint - plus it's pricey! I'm glad In-N-Out embraces its menu, and knows who it is: simple, fast food. Now I know why people speak of its lore, it's so good! It's really a shame that we don't have In-N-Out in FL, it would be my favorite place to get burgers. I loved that all of the ingredients in the burger were fresh, but still easy to hold in my hand. I also enjoyed the the fries tasted like they were cut that day, and didn't have gallons of salt like other fast food fries. Perhaps it's better for my waistline that we don't have an In-N-Out where I live."}
{"text":"With 300+ reviews there's not much to add other than I really wish In-N-Out would open a franchise outside of the southwest region because they would undoubtedly be successful considering the killer food and service they provide.  Whenever I have the opportunity to eat at an In-N-Out I jump at it; regardless of whether or not I'd already eaten at one earlier in the week.    This location is right off of the strip and can be accessed via cab if you don't have a car.  Given its proximity to all the tourists (myself included) it's usually always busy no matter when you go.  Despite the constant crowds the staff here were genuinely friendly which only added to the awesome experience of chowing down on my Double Double and fries (both Animal style of course).  The milkshakes are also pretty good and deserve a worthy mention."}
{"text":"For the most part they do tend to have better customer service than other fast foods. I have gone in several occasions and most of the time I have gotten good customer service. Although, I did not give them a 5/5 stars for a few reasons: on weekends the drive thru lines are outrages ( should have more employees working) but I waited like minimum of 20 mins last time for just a number 1 on the menu! Also, I always get my burger well done and I always get it done medium when I asked for well done. Overall, it's good place and higher quality of service for a fast food."}
{"text":"I love and live on the east coast and have heard nothing but the best about In-N-Out Burger, well... they were right!!! I had a Double Double Animal Style and wow was it amazing. Yes this is fast food but the burger tasted better than most sit down places, which for me sends it to 5 stars. Also there vanilla milkshake was on point and sent my meal over the moon and through the Cosmos!!!!! If you have been on the fence or just on the west coast and have a chance to eat here, please do!  If you do not, you may regret it for the rest of your life!!!"}
{"text":"Always on point! Thers nothing better than a classic In N Out burger frehness and quality you've learned to expect from the franchise"}
{"text":"This is the only place where waiting 10-15 minutes for fast good is WORTH it!!   I'd never heard of in n out till about 6 months ago and never understood why people where willing to wait so long for burger and fries. But after one visit I understood!"}
{"text":"I love, \"In n Out\" but my burger I had two days ago was overcooked and small.  Flavor was on key but didn't get classically full like I typically do on a, \"Double Double\".    Service was good and food came out fast like always.  The lady who took my order messed up on my order and had to correct it.   Will I go back?  Yes, because it's convienient and always delicious, just might be a while since my tiny burger mishap."}
{"text":"Double double monster style with monster style fries. To drink...monster style, just pour that magical sauce right into a cup and I'll drink that too.  \"To fries or not to fries...\", this is the one lacking part of the meal, however, order your fries extra crispy monster style for a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Came here to check off the requisite east coasters on west coast experience. Honestly, it was not as good as I remember it being when I'd had it in 2009 in SF. The food was okay but not mind blowing. We ordered a grilled cheese and a veggie burger. The grilled cheese was fine, but the veggie burger was literally just lettuce and tomatoes between two buns?! We asked for another grilled cheese instead of that. Animal fries were okay but again, not as delicious as I remember. Not sure if it was just this location, or if my tastes have changed. Before we went here, I was planning to have in-n-out twice on this trip but after this experience, we didn't go back during our time there."}
{"text":"So Food Network has a list of the 50 burgers in each of the 50 states that you must try.  California's is In 'n Out's double-double, and though we weren't in Cali, Vegas has this fine establishment all over too.  We moseyed off the strip to partake in a lunch of cheeseburgers and animal style fries.  I don't remember In 'n Out always having onion rings on the burgers, but those, the lettuce, and tomatoes added a fresh crispness to the burger.  I only wish the patties were meatier.  I was more blown away by the delicious bun.  Love them buns!"}
{"text":"Double double...nuff said.  Not a big fan of the fries, though. Every time I come to town, always busy. Don't have one in ep so I don't know if it's busy all day or not.  Betting that it is."}
{"text":"My first in and out burger ever. I loved it! The menu is really small but I got a double double animal style! Delicious the dressing was a little sweet but altogether savory. Burger was amazing but fries were bland thin cut and had no flavor. Want to try the shakes next time! 4 stars for a fast food restaurant not any restaurant."}
{"text":"Great as always!! Being unable to get in-n-out regularly just makes you appreciate it so much more."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on our first day in Arizona because our friend kept raving about this place. It definitely lived up to all the hype! I got a regular cheeseburger with lettuce, tomatoes, and onions. I topped it off with some fries and a chocolate milkshake. I'm on vacation so I went all out! The burger was cooked perfectly and I was very pleased with the quick service. More of a fast food style place which I don't normally go to, but this was worth breaking the routine for!!! Will be back :)"}
{"text":"After just finishing my 5th burger since moving out here, I must say that although I do enjoy In-N-Out, I really do miss my Five Guys burgers that I used to get back in Alexandria, VA. I mean don't get me wrong, In-N-Out does the trick when you want something other than Mickey D's, BK, or Wendy's but I do wish they had more toppings to choose from. I mean I like their \"secret\" menu, however the fries are never crispy enough for me even when I get them well done and why do the seem to get cold almost as soon as you get them. That is the oddest thing to me. Why do I continue to go back one might wonder, well for starters I have a gift certificate that someone gave to me and we get free burger certificates from time to time here at work. Hello, I am not going to pass up free or prepaid meals. That would be just plain ridiculous LOL!"}
{"text":"Despite constantly busy, In-N-Out on Dean Martin is a store where the employees work fast and deliver great food!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and great prices. Would definitely come back on a late night . Best burgers hands down"}
{"text":"In-N-Out is the best fast food restaurant. No contest.  I have visited In-N-Out a countless number of times, and from that, I cannot think of a single time where I was less than satisfied.   The food is incredible, yet simple. The staff is super friendly. And for how crowded it usually is, In-N-Out delivers their product consistently, and at lightning speed.   A few tips for the newbies:   ~ In-N-Out has a secret menu. Be sure to ask for things like grilled onions, chopped peppers, protein style (no bun, wrapped in lettuce), the 4x4 (4 patties and 4 pieces of cheese), animal fries (fries with cheese, sauce, and grilled onions), or even a grilled cheese!  ~ In-N-Out's fries usually run on the chewy side. Ask for them well done if you want them nice and crispy; they make them fresh to order!   Overall, you need In-N-Out in your life. This is not a topic for debate. If you read this review, start driving and do yourself the best thing you could do all day."}
{"text":"In N Out Burger is amazing. This location is always busy no matter what time you go. Prepare to wait a long time at the drive thru but like always their food is so good and shakes are amazing."}
{"text":"This in n out is just as good as any in n out in town. This drive through line is a bit long and not properly thought out in terms of how it is structured. It protrudes into the parking lot and it is only accessible from one street only. But on the flip side, when the line gets too long, there is usually someone outside assisting in taking orders. Friendly staff and almost always accurate in our food orders. Food is fresh & smells delicious!"}
{"text":"came on a Sunday afternoon and it was packed. This was my first time at an in-n-out and I had high expectations going in. Service was great but it seemed like service was longer than normal to get the food because of the crowd. Burger reminded me of McDonald's but just better quality. Really enjoyed the animal fries.   Great spot for affordable bite where all restaurants seemed to be expensive in the area of the strip."}
{"text":"Of course I love all In-N-Out locations. They are all the same, extremely busy and hectic. I am amazed at how they keep so many orders straight. I ate here 2 times while visiting Las Vegas. I'm from Illinois so you can't pass up the opportunity. Despite having to wait 10ish minutes each visit, the service was great. They got everything right and the food was delicious! Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"So because I am from the east coast, I have to take every opportunity I can to get my fill  of In-N-Out. This time, work took me to UNLV which, happily, has an In-N-Out right off campus.  I drove in on my last afternoon and went a little wild. Six doubles animal-style packed for travel. The team here was professional, cool, and efficient. I had my beautifully boxed burgers in minutes and they didn't break a sweat. The box was quickly refrigerated and then stuffed into my checked luggage. (I'm surprised TSA didn't pry my bag open and eat my bounty!)  They made it home to NYC in one piece thanks to the wonderful packing skills. And they were as delicious as I remembered."}
{"text":"Best service! Love how friendly and upbeat the entire crew is at this particular location.  I normally order a cheeseburger animal style combo but this past time I did the double meat and cheese.  I have to say that I don't think I can handle the double meat and cheese combo w/ animal style but look forward to resuming my cheesburger combo again! Thank you In-N-Out for providing light lemonade(minute maid) love that stuff!!"}
{"text":"As a new Vegas resident I figured it was time I finally tried In n Out.  Even on the East coast the cult following is known. The guy that took my order was polite and explained my options. I placed my order for a cheeseburger combo animal style no pickles to go. There were 2 people in front of me prior to my order.  After waiting 25 minutes my good was finally ready. On the way home I decided to try a few fries because I was hungry before I got to In n Out but at this point I was starving. The fries were cold!!!! When I get home 5 minutes later the burger and rest of the fries were cold too! How is it possible to be forced to wait and then get cold food??? Terrible experience. Change the name to In and Eventually Out with Cold Food."}
{"text":"3x3 Animal style ! A big delicious cheese burger for under $5 , WOW! Friendly and fast employees and probably the cleanest fast food chain."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and of course the best fast food in the universe. Sometimes a longer wait at drive through but its all freshly made to order and worth the wait. I have never had a problem with an order after at least 100 visits. Our goto spot for a fast food fix."}
{"text":"Iconic burger and fun location. We were not terribly hungry, so we decided to get a little something-something. There was a line out the door even though there were several other restaurants around. The line moved quickly, and since there were only certain things to order we had our food in no time. The burgers were delicious. The bun was toasted and the toppings were fresh. The fries were good but I like more skin on mine. It was a great place to eat our first night in Vegas."}
{"text":"Brace yourself for an unpopular opinion about In-n-out burger. Maybe it was all the hype, maybe I was still full from the pretzels at Guy Fieri's earlier that day, but I did not love In-n-out burger. I know. Gasp.   I got animal style and fries, and I did like the animal style sauce with the onions but I think I just prefer a thicker, more irregularly shaped burger with grill marks. I wanted more after hearing about it for the past umpteen years from various friends. The fries were good, but I immediately regretted not adding cheese or animal style sauce. My favorite part of the whole meal was the strawberry shake. It was so thick and sweet and made with real ice cream, not some weird milk product.   Service was good, employees were nice, but next time, I'll go to Shake Shack."}
{"text":"Service at 2 in the afternoon was fairly good.  They seemed to still be very busy from the lunch crowd.  I had a cheeseburger and fries.  The cheeseburger was very good.  The fries tasted like thin strips of cold cardboard.  I would order the burger again if I ever go back, but certainly would pass on the french fries."}
{"text":"When the opportunity presents itself, one  must try In-N-Out Burger at least once in their life.  Sorry, vegetarians and vegans - you're missing out on one of the best burgers on the West Coast.  This location can get super packed.  Finding a table will be the toughest thing you will encounter.  Although it gets packed, food is flying out to you, so don't get too comfortable."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about In-N-Out, ever. Yes, it's always super crowded and there's almost always a line, but that's to be expected from a West Coast staple and good, cheap food. Like most In-N-Out locations, the crew is energetic and responsive, giving this restaurant a great atmosphere with positive vibes. They do as well as they can to get through the orders, but you can expect to wait 10-15 minutes for your food on a busy day. When I was there most recently, we saw a group of about 40 get off a charter bus and snake through the restaurant in line. Their group was through the line in less than 10 minutes with no complaints. Impressive!"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious!!  This place was packed but everyone comes in for awesome burgers at crazy cheap prices we paid for a double double burger - double petty and double cheese and it was phenomenal!! This place is like five guys quality fresh burgers and McDonald's prices !!! So good!!   This location is further from the strip so the food is actually better!!"}
{"text":"Ah the legendary In & Out, how I wish you had a location in Toronto area!  Why oh why do you not have one? I guarantee you it would be a success!  The hype and the fame is well earned, it's just something about a freshly cooked burger done very well, with nothing but emphasis on taste, consistency and high quality that every other burger joint that tries to emulate your success have failed!   For the value, it cannot be beat.  Two large sized burgers (a double double, and a single) plus fries to share and a large drink all for under $10! Unheard of in Canada!  This place is THE Mecca for burger lovers everywhere and is a guaranteed visit for me whenever I am on the west coast!  Now, I just need to find a way to smuggle in more than a few dozen burgers for my trip home to the burger bland north that is Canada!"}
{"text":"Simply the best!!! Excellent price and tastes terrific. There's nothing quite like In n' Out Burger!"}
{"text":"Extra star for the cleanliness, efficiency, and friendly staff. Love they have the protein style burger option. They make it so it's easy to eat w out the gear spilling everywhere.  Burgers are fresher than most other fast food joints. French fries best to order well done. Find the burgers could have more flavor and wish that when ordering onions they weren't so generous as consumes the taste.  This is my favorite location and used to go on a regular basis w my kid."}
{"text":"We had so many out-of-town guests this past weekend during our wedding events, we decided to do In-n-Out for rehearsal dinner and our guests loved it!  We walked in the restaurant around 6pm on a Friday and there was no line.  I warned our cashier that \"this might sound crazy...but we need like 50 meals...\" and she didn't even bat an eye.  She was super calm and professional and just went \"ok, what do you need?\".  It was amazing!    She took our order for different burger varieties, gave us sides of grilled onions and secret sauce, and we returned to the mansion within 30 minutes!!!  Thank you for the BEST REHEARSAL DINNER EVER!"}
{"text":"Always good the only issue ever is the drive thru sometimes takes a long time. Everything is always consistent food spot for a bite:"}
{"text":"This has got to be the best fast food I've been to. I ordered double patty and single cheese (double single) and it was amazing. I definitely recommend this place. Staff are respectful and they are 100%. Efficient."}
{"text":"On a recent visit to the Phoenix area, we Seattleites decided to indulge in a trip to In-N-Out, something that we don't have up here. We are so glad we ate here.  The place was PACKED on a weekday afternoon and for good reason! Everything we ordered was incredible (burgers, fries, milkshake). Yum! Can't wait to go back! I deducted a star because we had nowhere to sit and the food took a long time.  Wish we had In-N-Out in Seattle."}
{"text":"Delicious, went here 3x with my family in one weekend.    My burger of choice is protein style, animal style, hamburger! My nephew's burger, I dubbed as the \"Kenn burger,\" is protein style, no tomatoes, cheeseburger.  He hates onions, but doesn't mind it on the animal style burger.   I love the animal style fries too.  Likely loaded with calories, but oh so delicious!"}
{"text":"man, what can i say?? small menu, freaking great burgers for freaking great price! fresh cut potatoes for fries, i think mcdonald's fries are best, but as far as burgers...in & out has them smoked!! shake n double double for under five bucks?? man, what a steal! if u have never tried in & out, u gotta stop what ur doing and get to one, now!! beats the hell outa any gourmet burger that costs three four times as much!! & get a shake, cheapest most delicious shake around! 5 stars all day, everyday. staff are always happy at in n out, and they show it by taking customer service up a notch! great going guys!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing and seeing good reviews on their animal style fries! Even the famous Taiwanese director Ang Lee went to eat their burger after the 2013 Oscars Ceremony, where he won the Oscar for Best Director! That news was repeatedly reported in Taiwan and made me really want to try In-N-Out!   I was so glad to find out there was a In-N-Out burger in Vegas and it was somehow \"close\" to our hotel according to Google Maps.  It took us forever to get there.. Almost an hour because we took the wrong side of the sidewalk. It was really sad to see the sign of In-N-Out but we couldn't pass through the highway to eat there... We were about to abandon because we were really tired from walking non-stop on the strip for the past few days and it just seems impossible for us to get to In-N-Out. We really had that \"so near yet so far\" feeling!!!   Advice: Do not try to get there from New York New York because there is no sidewalk after you have passed the hotel and all you have is highway and cars driving really fast and drivers calling you crazy. Please take the sidewalk along Excalibur hotel (W Tropicana Ave) and walk straight until you arrive on Dean Dr Martin, then you will see and smell In-N-Out! You can also take the taxi to get there (easier and faster)!  Even before we got there, we could smell their burgers/fries and it smelled so good! There were a lot of people and the parking slot was all filled with cars. It was a little bit hard to find seats for 6 people but we didn't want takeout since it is always better to eat it there, right?   I ordered the animal-style hamburger (with hand-leafed lettuce, tomato, a mustard cooked beef patty; add pickle, extra spread with grilled onions) and an animal-style fries (melted Cheese, Secret Spread that looks like Thousand Island dressing and Grilled Onions). I should have picked the cheeseburger instead of hamburger just to have more textures. I would like to try their Protein style (burger wrapped with lettuce instead of buns) since it sounds \"healthier\".   Although some people find the animal-style a bit too greasy and heavy, I find it perfect since it made the fries even more flavorful! My parents' friends loved In-N-Out so much that they said they wouldn't mind eating this everyday while they are still in Vegas (they loved it more than Shake Shack)!"}
{"text":"My family and I  eat at In-Out  frequently when we go to Austin, since we don't have one in the border town we live in.  The burgers are terrific and fries are much better than other fast food restaurants.  I would have given them 5 stars but they don't have a rewards app or online order and pay app.  We normally pick up something for our son, who lives in Austin, and take the food to eat at his house.  But the inside is nice to eat in as well, and very clean!  So an app to order and pay would help us a lot because the drive thru is hard for my husband and I sometimes. The double double and all that...and my son always wants something from the secret menu...by the way, animal fries are NOT french fries cut in the shape of animals...we found that out the hard way when we ordered 3 animal fries...but anyways, in addition to the food, the servers are super sweet and nice! I always think about how those kids (most of their employees are younng) are probably working 3 jobs just to live in Austin, yet they are all so patient and always are smiling!"}
{"text":"It hits the spot every single time. I love that I can always expect my food to be hot. Menu is simple and  there's a secret not so secret menu, which is not complicated just not on the board.  Is a must for all of my East Coast friends to go to In-N-Out when they visit. Usually when they step out of the plane:)"}
{"text":"What is all the hype about??  The burgers are greasy and fries not that great.  Sorry In n Out only 2 stars from me."}
{"text":"First Time to a In-N-Out Burger, Im not going to say that this was the best tasting burger that I have ever had, because its not. But what I can say that the customer service was out of this world. From the moment that your order to when youre sitting down eating your food, someone is always making sure that everything is the way that its supposed to and that you dont need anything. I ordered a cheeseburger, fry, and strawberry milkshake, and it did not disappoint.  If you are from the midwest like me, you may want to give In-N-Out burger a try. Its an experiecne that you dont want to miss."}
{"text":"Took 45 min to even get our food.. and by the time we did. It was cold. - I do not recommend this location."}
{"text":"I missed In-N-Out terribly being that they are so rude that they have not opened a store in Austin Texas yet.  Seriously, why do you have to do this to me?  I was hoping that MAYBE I had remembered the food being better than it was, and that really, the burger places around here were actually yummier.    Nope.  Double doubles are all that and then some.  The fries are heaven.  I probably shouldn't have eaten here because now I won't be satisfied with the burgers I get here in Texas.  Tip: you CAN walk here from the strip.  Just walk down the sidewalk on the excalibur side of the street across the freeway bridge entrance area and under another little bridge and you're there.  It's like a 15 minute walk.  We took a cab there because we didn't know where it was, but we totally felt silly about it when we got there and then walked back."}
{"text":"Love In and Out Burger. The quality and value is unmatched. This particular store is very clean and the employees seem to enjoy what they're doing. I'm a customer for life."}
{"text":"Typical In-N-Out Burger. Excellent. Everybody that goes there knows what great food they have at a great price"}
{"text":"We usually go to the location off Tropicana but we were at Fry's electronics and this location was right up the street, our craving for a double double and fries was pretty strong too. You can't go wrong with a burger and fries, its always good! We always try to get a burger or two in when were in town, staff is always courteous and friendly, I have to admit most of the locations that I have been too there was a long wait, but I'd rather get a cooked burger than a under cooked one, so its worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food tastes great every time but for some reason nobody can get my order correct. Here's my order:  3x3 Animal Style/No Grilled Onions/Easy Spread/Extra Extra Extra Chopped Chilies  Now, it's not really THAT complicated and usually they get it right... except for the chopped chilies part. Am I supposed to tell them how many peppers I want on my burger? I don't think I am but in this case I should've. I just ordered this burger (burger only) and what do you know?!?!? Not a single chopped chili pepper in sight. Zip. Zero. Zilch. Any normal person would go back in and complain or something like that but I was in the drive thru and starving af. It was muy delicioso!!! Yum... ummm, where were my peppers? :( I stopped eating half way through to double check and I was sad to see that they weren't there.  So, I guess next time I come through, I'll have to tell them how many I want. If I'm going to pay $5.08 for a burger, I at least want it my way."}
{"text":"Okay, I know. But when we are out west, we eat way to much of this. Fresh fries, and burgers are always fresh."}
{"text":"It's always SO cold in here!!! Burgers are okay.  Slightly above any other fast-food place.  But if you don't gulp down your food in under two minutes it will be as cold as if it came out of a refrigerator!"}
{"text":"Last 2 orders of fries I've had at this location needed a fork because it was pieces. It was as if someone had used the fry scoop to chop them up into 1\" lengths before filling the basket. Very disappointing because it makes them hard to dip. In and Our is one of the very few places I eat fries because they are gluten free as opposed being cross contaminated by other fried foods or coated with something that contains gluten."}
{"text":"Ive always had a great experience here and feel the food is always good and the prices are reasonable as well. No complaints at all.. I will be going back here again for sure!"}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out in general, and this one is no different. It's busy but they get your order to you fast. There are seats both inside and out, just look for a place to sit while you are waiting on your order. Burgers are exceptional and fresh. Nice to have an In-N-Out Burger so conveniently located."}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out, and this is like all the rest, but it does get BUSY, especially at night. It's funny watching the limos pull up and the drunks file out to get their late night burger fix, though. What happens at In-N-Out, stays at In-N-Out I guess..."}
{"text":"This place is so consistent that a review seems not needed.   I had my usual \"Grilled Cheese with extra Tomato\" and a fry.   It was hot, fresh and delicious!  The cashiers were friendly and the ease of placing my order was nice.  There wasn't too long of a line (big shock!) but for us faithful followers we would wait no matter how long !"}
{"text":"Like most of my other reviews of I&OB what more can I say but that it was perfect?!?!  We like to stop at this one before grocery shopping at the nearby Walmart. The parking lot can be tight, so keep an eye out when pulling in for the people pulling out of the drive-thru. The nearby eateries are popular too, and it can just be a congested mess all around in the parking lot.  The staff is always friendly and my food always excellent!"}
{"text":"I have reviewed other In-N-Out Burger locations, so it seemed strange I didn't have a review for this location since it is the one I most frequent (at least once a week). Seems more like \"creeper fishy\" to me, but anyways. This location is my favorite. I have been eating here since it opened and have never once had an issue. Consistency is clearly something In-N-Out Burger focuses on. The inside is always very clean as well the restrooms. The line inside as well the drive-thru can be crazy, but it's worth it. If eating inside it is best to go in with others so you have someone to order and get drinks so the other can scout out a spot to sit. The booths are hard to come by at peak times. The parking can fill up too, but recently they have added orange cones so there isn't as much congestion between the parking area and the drive-thru.   Everybody pretty much knows the secret menu at In-N-Out Burger isn't so secret anymore. I love that the menu is so simple. When you know how to make something right, you don't need a large menu. Hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries, shakes and drinks are what you will find here! For me this last visit (and pretty much every visit) I had a \"Grilled Cheese W/Grilled Onions\" (no lettuce) and it was perfect. Sometimes I get extra tomato, extra grilled onions or even ask that they add mustard. I also ordered \"Animal Style Fries\" and was glad hubby helped me eat them because it was a decent size. The chilies here are good and you can get them chopped on your burger or just on the side to munch on.  If you like to spoil your pooch then order a \"Flying Dutchman\" for them and they will thank you :)   Hours: Sunday - Thursday 10:30 am-1:00 am Friday 10:30 am - 1:30 am  Saturday 10:30 am - 1:30 am"}
{"text":"I have to give props to where its due.  My In-N-Out fixes are few and far between, but this one did me good and gave me some lovin'.  It fulfilled its duty.  I needed something nice and greasy to get ready for the nights libations.  The cheeseburgers are the bomb, and the french fries are oh so choice.  It's right across the street from Freakin' Frogs, so geographically, it's good to go."}
{"text":"I finally decided to try this place and I'm glad I did. I love the burgers! The patties are cooked perfectly and with the crispness of the lettuce and tomatoes these burgers kick ass. No wonder why people out here and in Cali are obsessed with this place. I still don't get all the lingo (I'm from the east coast)... 3x3, 4x4 ... but whatever. Although I finally know what animal style and protein style are. I'll be coming back often."}
{"text":"I've given this location many chances since it first opened and it's still completely hit or miss. Before the area developed more there wasn't ever much of a line, yet my order still at times came out wrong. Now that more homes have been built around the area this location has the usual...wrapped around the building long lines, and my order still isn't always right. I order a simple Grilled Cheese and ask for grilled onions and end up biting into nasty hard char pieces from the grill. I ask for no lettuce and sometimes get extra. I ask for regular fries and sometimes they come out overcooked/black. It's a bummer because In N Out is known for being consistent and I love eating there often. When this location does get it right it's absolutely delicious! I just wish they were consistent with other locations in town. The inside is clean and there's plenty of parking in the lot. The dining area outside is dog friendly."}
{"text":"It is a good burger, but nothing so special about it.  It is just a very good home style burger."}
{"text":"I'm always craving In-N-Out. Today was different though I was really really craving it. I was surprised when we got out order it wasn't correct.  We went through the drive-thru.  I have never had one of the workers ask if we wanted \"special sauce\" on our burgers it has always been \"spread\". That wasn't a big deal to us we just thought it was funny.  My hubby ordered a \"4x4\" and I ordered my usual \"Grilled Cheese\". We always ask for it with grilled onions and for them to add mustard. Well, they repeated the order back to us true I&OB style.  We pulled away (napkins covering the food so couldn't see it just yet) and eagerly pulled into the parking lot across the street to get our grub on.  The fries were black, and I mean blaaaaack. They were mostly nubs instead of regular long fries.   I have been eating I&OB for decades and know they are the most consistent food chain out there. I had only one time ever had an issue at a location where the fries were black and I called their 800 # to complain and I have to say I never ever thought a fast food company would go so above and beyond to satisfy a customer. I was very very impressed.  Sure, I could call and complain about this visit but I'm not looking for freebies and I know for a fact I will be eating I&OB for many more decades to come as it is just too darn delicious. I instead just talked directly to the manger so he was aware as I know he knows that preparing the food a I&OB correctly is the standard they want to uphold.  He was very polite and apologetic. I *heart* I&OB!"}
{"text":"I go enough to have tried all the secret menu. They are an enthusiastic crowd and really try and get your order right and make you happy. It's fresh food. It's a burger. It's fries."}
{"text":"Love this location! Everyone is friendly and even though they are always busy, I get my order at a fashionable time. They tend to fill up tables so we always check before we order. If they're full we usually will take it to-go."}
{"text":"Their fries are great, but their burgers aren't nearly as good as Dicks Drive In.  If you're ever in Seattle stop by Dicks and judge for yourself."}
{"text":"For an In N Out, this one takes the cake.  I've never had a mistake order from here nor any problems. There is always a line... I mean always... they even have to turn away people after they have closed!  The food is your typical in n out deliciousness and the staff is quite obliging.  I actually met \"Johnny Cupcakes\" here once while he was staying at the hotel next door. Parking is acceptable and getting in and out (lol) of here is pretty standard if you go the back way, the light by the freeway is a nightmare."}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out (What Californian doesn't like this place???)! If you seriously never had one of their burgers then you gotta find one ASAP! I hardly ever rate fast food places with 4 stars.  I usually order the double double with grilled onions and I get the bun extra toasted. For fries I get them \"well-done\" which basically means they are cooked a bit longer so they are extra crispy (just like how all fries should be!). The food is just addicting. I literally stuffed my face yesterday and couldn't stop eating my meal until everything was gone :(, I also tried their shake, but I am not really a fan since it is pretty thick and I couldn't even drink it with my straw xD.  Overall, this place has cheap, good quality, and tasty food. The establishment is pretty clean and the staff is really nice and friendly. The fact that this place has a bunch of cars in the drive-through even at night is a clear indication of how awesome this place is! I even prefer this place over Shake Shack (not really sure why that place is so hyped up)."}
{"text":"ok I love in n out and it's delicious every time (we go almost once or twice a week) but today was the SIXTH, yes SIXTH time they've gotten my order wrong. one time I had to go back a second time before they just made me a whole new burger because they usually just take my burger back to the kitchen and bring it back out which is normally against policy to take it back after they've given it but it's ok I don't mind really. we love in n out, but I am getting really tired of having to go back for them to get my really simple (pickles, tomatoes, ketchup ONLY, nothing else) hamburger right.): hopefully next time won't be the seventh."}
{"text":"Ohhhh am I disappointed . My friend is in town and I got off work late so we decided to get in and out since it is open lat (which I appreciate). What I don't appreciate is the fact that my burger was cold and also partially uncooked. Along with my friends who was also cold. There should of been no reason for our food cold. There was barely anyone inside and there was about 3 cars ahead of us. I understand that it's 11:10/11:20 at night and the crew is tired, hot and just wants the night to be over (trust me I work in the food Industry I know how it is) but the effort should still be 100%, even 99% would be nice. This isn't the first in and out that I have been two in the past 2 weeks that I have been to that I have had issues with by another one in Mesa. Hope things change because in do love eating here."}
{"text":"Well I've finally eaten here and I must say. .... what is all the fuss about?  These burgers are terrible!!  Very uninspiring and bland. Burger King has better butgers!! Oh and the fries..... just as bad."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place but never had the opportunity to check it out since it doesn't exist on the east coast. I made it a priority to eat a burger while in Vegas. Given the cheap price and fast lines, I'd say it's worth it. However, it's overhyped and not the best there is. I'd honestly choose Shake Shack and Five Guys over In-N-Out. Overall though, it's still a pretty good tasting burger."}
{"text":"Eh!  I've had better, but I've also had worse.  It's so commercialized that they have lost touch with their customers.  The employees there are like robots, including the way they speak to you.  I threw away my receipt by mistake, and when I went to grab my food off the counter it was like throwing a wrench into the mix.  They all started questioning me, almost interrogating me over a $6 greasy burger, instead of just believing me.  I've never stolen a burger yet and if I had to start today, it definitely would NOT be from here!"}
{"text":"very very nice employees and the service was extremely quick !!!! You can tell these people bust ass, every single one of them!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Cheap eats. Real fries from potatoes.  Quick good service.   Burger patties aren't that big but for the price it's well worth it"}
{"text":"So confused by the hype of in and out?? You guys that are enthusiasts are gunna have to clue me in?! What exactly is supposed to be good here? The burger was forgettable at best and the fries were literally inedible. They were almost completely white and fully limp.  Just totally confused after all the raving Iv heard about this chain."}
{"text":"For my first time to in-n-out this one for as packed as it was outside and inside, the burgers animal style and fries animal style, with a drink for 2 people is not worth 18 dollars but still filling.  Grounds and inside were clean."}
{"text":"I must be the only person in America who has never eaten at an In-N-Out Burger....until today when I ate lunch there. The verdict:  pretty good burger and fries. Long wait at lunch time though, over 15 minutes once I ordered.   Try it."}
{"text":"First time here, reasonable prices, pretty darn good burger! Friendly staff, clean restaurant, and they pay $11.50 an hour with benefits, PTO and and 401k! Unbelievable bcuz I live in Alaska and McDonald's only pays $10.50 an hour and our cost of living is way higher there! Obviously a great company too"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. It's usually crowded but I have no complaints. The staff here is always friendly and on point. This is one of my favorite burger places. They make the burger any way you like, just tell them how you want it."}
{"text":"My favorite burger bar Always good service Very clean and organized  Highly recommend  Also they have option for letters wrap low carb"}
{"text":"Drive through is quick place is so clean double double protein style and animal fries I'm in heaven a great quality burger for a great price !"}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm glad there is one in my neighborhood. Good quality, good service, good prices."}
{"text":"Visited 2 in need out burgers this week, really impressed with the quality of service and fair pricing. Wish they had this back home.."}
{"text":"In this day and time, it's rare to get a GOOD deal. The burger prices are very fair. Plus they are well made.  only downside, really slow this visit."}
{"text":"What can I say the only place to have a burger if there is a location within 100 miles. There is no reason to go anywhere else"}
{"text":"We always have this when we travel to Vegas. It's always very fresh and the staff does such a great job in facilitating the orders."}
{"text":"I have never been to an In-N-Out until yesterday. We arrived and there were people everywhere. They were eating on the curb, on the hoods of their cars, on the ground, just everywhere. It's never a bad sign to see that, right? There were about 15 people in line in front of me, but it moved swiftly. I got animal style fries and just a single cheeseburger. My order was called in less than 5 minutes, and OH. MY. GOSH. So good! The sauce is a fancy Thousand Island/Comeback and it's good on everything. The restaurant could have been a little cleaner, but the volume of people can deter from that. I'm a fan, and I'll come back when I visit Vegas again!"}
{"text":"Hmm... I guess my friends and I were just too hyped up about this place.  This was my first trip to Vegas and the first meal we had off the plane was In-N-Out.  I knew this place was going to be a tourist trap but the crowd is insane.  Despite the amount of people, there is plenty of seating.  My order took about 8 minutes after I ordered.  Not too fast for a fast food joint.  Anyhoo, the Double Double burger was good but I can't say the same for the fries.  Made from high grade potatoes?  That's nice.  Too bad they're soggy!  I'd give this place 4 stars but to me a burger joint can only be outstanding if BOTH the burger and fries are good."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong at in and out period dot!! And as usual this location had polite service and good prices. If you are looking for a low carb option get your burger wrapped in lettuce:) and just skip the fries. But I am sure not many can resist"}
{"text":"Never and I mean NEVER had a bad experience at any of the In-N-Out locations. Always quality food and today at the Surprise location I decided to time the drive thru. There were easily 15-20 cars deep and after timing each one, they left happy in under a minute average. Slowest one was 1:04. Talk about a well oiled machine with every employee wearing a smile. No wonder I think of no other place when I want a good burger!!  Thanks again In-N-out!  Yet another fantastic experience!!"}
{"text":"Its good stuff but i dont understand the hype? its all very fresh, taste good but not the best. better than any other fast food burger place. and its cheap! milkshake is good! i do love the fires tho! i love onions but not theres, its just to dam much! just good fast cheap food!"}
{"text":"Ok ...I got to in and out and there were about 15 cars in line at the drive through. The line was moving very slow but I hung in there. I ordered and then waited at least 20 minutes to go through the line. they hand me my food and of course its not my order. They gave my food to the car infront of me and then they noticed they must have messed up at least 5 orders before me....CHECK YOUR FOOD BEFORE YOU LEAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So I asked for the manager her name was Audry. She proceeds to lecture me on how she runs her crew. Very unprofessional and she was as rude as they come.....I didnt mess up you did!!! Might want to check with company policy on how to treat customers that you mess up their order...Then she stands at the window and stairs at me like she wants to fight.....Certainly not what anyone needs when your just trying to pick up dinner for the family......There is another location on eastern that I go to as well!!! I think I will just go to that one from now on to avoid the confrontation from a power hungry, uneducated, mean person.....  When I left there were at least 40 cars stuck in the drive thru due to their mistakes.......Might want to look into someone that can run the restaurant that has some experience or at least a good attitude....A smile goes a long way....Wont go back to this one for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"First time to try in and out burgers. Living in PA we do not have this burger chain, but I have heard about it.   So we decided to try it, since we were in the mood for some quick burgers and didn't want to go to Burger King or mc Donald's.  You had 3 selections of burgers; double double, cheese burger and a hamburger.  I ordered the cheese burger with everything on it and my husband ordered the double double. The meal comes with drinks and fries.  We did not wait long for our order.  The burger was great, it's better than the other fast food burger places for sure. The fries were great too crunchy on the outside and soft inside.   I now wish that we had in and out burgers in PA, I now understand why people rave about in and out burgers.   If you're  wanting a quick burger to eat and do not want the usual fast food joints we all tend to go to and have in and out burger joints in your area, for sure pick the latter!"}
{"text":"It's always busy here.....Why?    I only when here because my niece wanted it!  I haven't been here in over 8 yrs.  I see why it took me so long for me to come back!  I decided to go ahead and try something.  I got the no. 2. I'm glad I took it to go.  So when we got home, I took a couple ob bites.....ummm it wasn't that great, so I go to my cabinet, pulled out some spices!  Jazzed it up....Tasted it!  Then it was much better.  Now if I have to take it home and spice it up, I might as well cook my own.  I won't ever go back!  ugggggg!"}
{"text":"It's an In-N-Out, so you know what you're getting.  It seems to always be packed any time of day, but you still get pretty fast service.  Food quality is totally consistent no matter what."}
{"text":"I ordered a double double with grilled onions no tomatoes no lettuce it was right when the store opened at 1030 in the morning so the wait in the drive thru should not have been 20 minutes, very upsetting however food was great made to perfection without any errors on my cheeseburger"}
{"text":"First time here during the summer. I came during the night, wasn't as packed as I expected. The service and food was served fast. The burgers itself were amazingly delicious. Definitely worth the money and trip there. It's cheap and the place was clean, the food was fresh and it had a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hubby and I made the pilgrimage to In-N-Out after hearing so many great things about it.  We don't have any on the east coast, so we took advantage of our trip to Las Vegas to try it out.  Amazingly, this one was within walking distance (albeit a long and circuitous walk) of our hotel.    The burgers and fries were okay, but this was not an \"OMG, BEST BURGERS EVER\" kind of experience.  Yes, they do a better job than Burger King, McDonalds, and the like, but that's not saying much, is it?    What I liked:  The toasted buns, the burger's flavor, and the fries (like McDonald's but more potatoey) What I didn't like:  The unbelievable busy-ness of the place, the lack of anyone cleaning tables as people left.    At home, we have Five Guys.  In-N-Out is similar, but certainly no better."}
{"text":"Cannot complain about this place. I lived in AZ for 4 years and been here too many times to name, the service was always great. I do not think they messed up my order once and I usually was with a handful of people when I did come here. I enjoy the burgers, hot and fresh with so much flavor. The fries are great as well and shake great too. The menu is simple but that is In-N-Out it does a burger classic always consistent.   I can truly say the service is always quick, and the employees always seem to have the same positive energy when taking orders or asking if there is anything they can do. That goes along way when it is hot in AZ and they are still smiling outside etc. It really shows they do not mind working at In-N-Out and understand good customer service. All good things to say on my end about this Tempe spot! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I'm probably in the minority here but I did not love In N Out. The burger was good, but nothing to write home about. The fries were terrible. I'm a fry addict and I wanted nothing to do with these. Glad I tried it but it definitely didn't live up to all the hype."}
{"text":"Update! Came here and was super surprised about the quality. They make their fries crispy even without asking. Usually in n out is on the soggy side but these were perfect! And the bun...pages crispy too! Usually the bun gets all soggy from the sauce they put on but it was perfect from start to finish! By far my favorite in n out I've ever been to! Props Nevada"}
{"text":"I lovee in n out! Every location is always consistent. My usual order is a hamburger with extra lettuce and extra tomato and whole grilled onions!  Super cheap and super fast. This is probably the only fast food that I eat. I like how this location is off the strip and next to a chevron..very convenient for coming or leaving Vegas."}
{"text":"Stopped in carefree on our way to northern AZ. What can I say? As usual, the employees especially Murphy were very friendly, the food  was fresh and delicious, and the ambiance like most other In N Out Burgers    Ordered the animal  style burger, husband ordered double double animal  style and well done  fries"}
{"text":"It's fast food chain done right - high quality - they only locate stores that they can reach from their own distribution centers, always fresh food consistent experience - these places will always be clean, they will have cheerful staff, you know what's on the menu and there aren't any surprises. good prices - a hamburger, fries and a soda for under $6 - with taxes -  how often can you say that? the menu is simple in terms of the basics of what is offered but highly creative in terms of how you can get it served (animal style fries - who else does that?) it's an experience, it's the kind of place you probably won't go to every day but when you do,  you know that you'll get a great burger at a good enough price that you don't have to skip the fries."}
{"text":"Is there anything else to be said?  This place is a west coast institution and may be spreading further east soon (hopefully).    For those from the east coast familiar with Five Guys, you know the setup but these burgers are better. Order everything \"animal style\" and get a large drink. You won't regret it.   This location stays busy but there is seating outside and the lines move quick. I'll be coming back every other day I'm here."}
{"text":"I love there burgers here. Food was great and service was also fast. I had multiple trips here, and carried a few on the plane ride home. Too bad none in Hawaii"}
{"text":"Good stuff. Long line great perfectly prepared burger. Mmmmmmmmmmm. Mmmmmmmmmmm. Need I say more?  I think not. The only person who shouldn't love these guys would be a vegan!!"}
{"text":"My mom thinks I come to see her in Arizona because I want to come and see her. What she doesn't understand is I just come for the In-N-Out.  Ok, so that may not be totally true, but it's part true. My first taste of In-N-Out was in San Fran. Now, my only taste comes when I visit for the holidays. A forever yearning that is satisfied but once a year.   The animal fries beckon. Will you heed their call?  Why aren't you in Seattle?! WHYYYYYYYYYY"}
{"text":"The shortest line at an In-n-out I've ever seen. They don't skimp on any ingredients and when you ask for extra, they give it to you! Where else can i get such a high quality fast food burger (grilled cheese as of late) at this cost!?"}
{"text":"Best burgers you can get! I always get a Double-Double with my favorite toppings, along with fries and a drink (sometimes adding a shake). Everything is freshly prepared and you can taste the difference. Such a wonderful change from other burger chains (you know who you are). The staff is so friendly and helpful as well--I come in so often they know my order by heart! In-N-Out gets my highest recommendation (and most of my burger business!)."}
{"text":"This place Is everything I expected it to be, food wise. The burgers are amazing. They really got this down to a science. I got. Double-double, a cheeseburger animal style, fries, soda, & a neapolitan shake. Yeah, I was starving. I just landed in Vegas and boy, that flight from NY is longer than I expected. First stop, in & out. Oh, and I think they have, hands down, the best fries I ever ate in my life."}
{"text":"Step one: Consume adult beverages to a blissful stage Step two: get a taxi cab step three: give direct orders to hit IN-n-OUT burger stat! step four: arrive at the glory that is the order receiver, order away step five: consume, burp, pay for taxi and tip the guy.  Not to forget do not stare at the kids at the counter, it is going to be a strange site to see those fresh faces, looking so studious and awake... and not on some high....  Double Double Animal Protein style....."}
{"text":"Secret Menu:  http://giph.site/v.php?pm=5BRE  Take some to-go for a friend and they will thank you. Good eating!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the mood for a great burger, In & Out will always deliver. Whether I eat inside, in the car or pick up through the drive-through they always make some good burgers. In & Out will continue to be the place to come to."}
{"text":"I consistently visit this location because it's right when you get on the 60 coming from Globe. The food and service are always fantastic!! Even when the drive-thru is packed... They move quick, and get it right the first time!!  Delish and fresh every time!"}
{"text":"Everyone knows what the food looks like so I won't worry about posting any photos but I will say the food is always delicious and the service is amazing here!   We went with the drive thru this time and from placing our order, to paying, to receiving our food every employee we dealt with was incredibly friendly and personable.   Our food was great tasting and fresh! Protein style burgers, animal style fries and tasty shakes. You can't beat the price and the freshness of in n out. A great burger, great service and a great price.   As always, we will be back."}
{"text":"If you don't know In-N-Out Burger then I'm not sure what to say. The premiere fast food burger joint is an iconic institution of the West Coast and a must try for anyone visiting from out of town. It's simple, fresh and hits the spot when a good burger, fries and shake is what you want. Tip: go crazy with the Animal style add on which is not on their menu."}
{"text":"These guys build a strong burger. But I had an issue with the waitress who would not give me a shake right away when I asked. Still five stars. Loved the burg'."}
{"text":"Super crowded, the staff is very friendly though but man is this place crowded, and full of self entitled snobs who intentionally take their sweet time to eat so that no tables will open up for others to sit. I watched a mom tell her daughter to slow down, they are the first 4/5 of the burger quickly and the last 2 bites took 10 minutes. I would go to a different in n out, it's just too crowded."}
{"text":"Uncrowded, and away from the strip. Go here for a quick awesome bite to eat with minimal wait times. Not much you can say about in n out, it's exactly the same everywhere else, and amazing as usual."}
{"text":"One of my favorite fast food restaurants. I was busy running errands and was looking for a healthier quick option. This location can get busy but they are very great about moving the line quickly. They usually have someone taking orders so that way they can start cooking and move the line faster. Everything is always so fresh and made to order. Service is great too! Each person asked me how I was and wished me a great day.   Today I got a double double protein style (wrapped in lettuce) with added grilled onions. Ate it in my car so they give you a lap napkin and a tray which makes it easy to eat. I didn't get fries this time but normally I love them! Super fresh and delicious. I get them well done so they are super crispy. Highly recommend!   Lastly, they have great prices for a fast food restaurant. I will see you again soon in and out. Thank you for the yummy lunch today (:"}
{"text":"Workers are really nice and friendly.  The reason I go to this location is because the food always tastes fresh and the building, restrooms and tables are clean and nice."}
{"text":"Yay, I finally tried in n out! Ok, so let me start off by saying that I am a picky eater.... So I got a single with cheese and lettuce. The burger to me was just average and I had wished I got a double because the single just didn't seem enough. I really enjoyed to fries! I guess it was one of those try it once because its not in Chicago type of thing!"}
{"text":"Great cheap delicious burger.  The drive thru service, well.. never fail that something asked is missing."}
{"text":"Remember that time back in college when you were so stoned at like 3 in the morning with a serious case of the munchies? And the only thing you could find in the frat house refrigerator was a bag of frozen french fries that had been in there since your freshman year. But being desperate, you threw them in the oven at 500 degrees ('cause you just couldn't imagine waiting 15 minutes to eat). And then you burned yourself on the pan when you pulled them out, but you were too stoned to feel the pain (although you were quite certain you were going to feel it in the morning). Do you remember how, after just a few bites of what might just be the nastiest thing you ever ate, you threw them in the garbage and thought to yourself, \"What's the use? What's the point to all of this? Why do I even bother? Why do I even go on\" And when you woke up late the next afternoon, you went straight down to the registrar's office and changed your major to philosophy. Then you started getting drunk and smoking pot every night with that long-haired old guy who hangs out at the bar, the guy who never showers and always hits on the freshmen girls who sneak in on the weekends; only to find yourself dropping out of college a few months later because you just couldn't disseminate the intellectual struggle between being and nothingness, and your professors were just too stupid to understand you. And now, 20 years later, you're living back home in your parents house, unable to keep a job and drinking away your paycheck every night in that same college bar. And when you look at yourself in the broken bathroom mirror you suddenly realize that you have become that old, smelly drunk who still hits on college girls. And you look back at your life and think to yourself -  \"If only I'da skipped those fries, everything in my life would be different now.\"  Trust me, those fries were gourmet compared to In-N-Out Burger's. They tasted like powdery, freezer burned match-sticks that had been reheated under a heat lamp - it was difficult to tell if they were made from potatoes or from some Star Trek food simulator machine.  My burger was equally disgusting. It is fair to say the only part of the burger that did not suck was the lettuce. The bun was stale and dry, the browned skin of the bun's top peeled off like 60 year old wallpaper from an old pickle factory, leaving what looked and tasted like a frozen bun that was thawed on high in the microwave..  I have nothing to complain about with the vanilla shake - at last, nothing to complain about.  In all told, my last visit to In-N-Out Burger was as disappointing as anything you could imagine. My guess is, there IS a limit to how much you can cut-back on quality just to save a dime. It's a shame for such an iconic brand."}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place. Burgers are great, fries are fresh, and shakes are cold. Quality food and great customer service. Always made fresh and to order. Can't say enough! Check it out."}
{"text":"Pretty solid place for a quick burger. Everything is fresh. Not many options, but why would you want a salad at a burger joint anyways. Pretty clean on the inside and a really friendly staff. I have had several friends work there. They always talk about how good they treat the employees. I think that is reflected on the customer service in a great way. Keep it up guys!!"}
{"text":"I write reviews on In-N-Out's I've been to, like it's my job.  Because, I wish it was.  Nothing new to see here, but it's an In-N-Out.  My fast food, Mecca..."}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out... They have my favorite burger of all the burgers I've had... Originally being from southern California, I may be biased about it, but Double-Doubles are so amazing... And I eat a lot of burgers in a lot of places.   The sweetness of the sauce compliments the saltiness of the patties, contrasts the mildness of the cheese, compliments the crispness of the lettuce/tomato, contrasts the chewiness of the buns...  The fries are great too. Not overly crisp, not soggy, lightly salted, fried in vegetable oil, and cut to order.   They just stick to what they know and what the do well. Not over complicating the menus and keeping it simple. (even the \"secret menu\")"}
{"text":"This location has the distinct advantage of being within walking distance from where ever I stay in Vegas.  Totally worth the possibility of passing out from ridiculous 135 fahrenheit temps that make Vegas, Vegas.   I love In-N-Out... They have my favorite burger of all the burgers I've had...

{"text":"Yummy yummy and more yummy!! Even though I'm trying to eat healthy, I must have a double double occasionally. This is the best burger around!"}
{"text":"Best low-carb burger in town.... Double Double with cheese protein style (wrapped in lettuce)."}
{"text":"I can't say how much I love in-n-out, not just for their food but for being a leader in their industry. I actually love Dairy Queen but every time I go there the order is wrong and the employees are not trained well. So I stopped going. But I have never had an issue with in-n-out. The employees repeat their order to you at least 3 times so they haven't made a mistake with my order yet. They seem more positive and upbeat at their jobs. I hear that the pay is decent or at least higher than at other fast food joints, I think that helps employees have pride in their jobs when they feel they are being taken care of. When you feel like you're not compensated properly it reflects in your overall view of your workplace and, unfortunately, that will be passed onto the customers.   People will come back when they have a positive experience and you might lose them for good if they have one bad experience. In-n-out, at least this location, is doing a wonderful job and I will continue to be a loyal customer."}
{"text":"I love these guys it's always consistently good I've never had a terrible experience but maybe when they forgot to give me the peppers , but it's not like they don't have them at the last window with a smile . Thank you guys for your hard work and staying true to your brand promise"}
{"text":"Old Reliable! This is the go to place when you have that burger craving. It is always as good as it gets and satisfys that hunger pain for lunch, dinner or late night! I always go with the double double meal and usually treat myself to a shake. That's right, the shakes are pretty darn good, and if you do not know which flavor to get, mix them up with the neopolitan(Vanilla, Cocolate, Strawberry mixed into one). There is always a line and if you had In and Out you'll know why!!"}
{"text":"I love in n out...love! This isn't my normal location but I was in the area and had a craving. I placed my order with the gentleman standing in the drive through. I repeated it 3 times because I said no onions and he repeated the order back wrong each time. Sure enough when I got the order..SUPRISE.Onions! Just by picking them off I had to was my hands several times. I finally sprayed some Axe body spray from my gym bag so I didn't smell up my office. I'm not sure why you can't order through the call box but the more people your order goes through the easier it is to mess it up."}
{"text":"Great burgers as always and a convenient location on campus. Staying with friends at the Hard Rock  it took some east coast friends who never had the pleasure of tasting this West Coast treat. Animal style all around and as always a satisfying visit..That's what a hamburgers , all about!"}
{"text":"Gotta love In-N-Out! I first had them in CA before they were located in AZ. I've seen them out in NV as well when I was in Las Vegas. My go to burger is the Double Double Animal Style. You can Google the secret menu for this place and start experimenting with it. Lately I've been getting a Cheeseburger Animal & Protein Style. I'm not big on the fries animal style, but to each their own. The shakes are good too. Vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry are the shake flavors. Fries are made from potatoes that are peeled, cut fresh, and fried right before they serve them to you. Delicious! I'm not sure if they still put a scripture verse on the bottom of the cups and fries containers, but they used to do that and I liked it. Hopefully they still do. Friendly staff...probably because the company pays their employees well and invests time and money to properly train their employees."}
{"text":"Quick, delicious, and most of all  CONSISTENT, never skimping on quality...another thing is I've received some of the BEST service from In-N-Out than some of these more upscale dining establishments!  My go-to items? Double-Double Combo with a Root Beer and a Neapolitan Shake chaser...-WINNAH!....ALOHA!!!  YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(173/365) \"One Solid Burger Joint\""}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5.0 Service: 2.5/5.0 Value: 3.5/5.0 Decor: 2.5/5.0 Overall: 3.5/5.0   I heart In-N-Out.  Long (read: late) operating hours, extremely convenient with the drive-through.  Wish Phoenix had even more of them.  Curious how often the outdoor seating gets used here."}
{"text":"Cold burgers with rubbery cold cheese and a 4 level process for drive through. Maybe they should all quit and go work on the Bigelow Aerospace assembly line.  These guys need about 6 people including a human speaker box replacement for their attempt to execute on one of the simplest processes in the world. Not acceptable."}
{"text":"If not for the hype and not regularly being at In & Out, this place would probably have a 4 out of 5 star rating from me. Coming from the coast, I was expecting so much. I will admit for the price it is a total steal of a deal to eat here. The fries were cold when they came out but I am very astonished by the excellent service they offered. Maybe it was just a bad experience on my part but I would recommend Smashburger over it. My opinion will change if I come back or experience another burger from a different In & Out restaurant."}
{"text":"My go-to fast food joint. Simple burgers, fries, and shakes. Open late. What could be better?"}
{"text":"I was very excited to come try the food here after hearing so much about it for years. I've never had such a let down. We both got the double and fries and everything was bland and tasteless.  Only positive was it was cheap eating for the LV Strip."}
{"text":"It was late, we had already been on the road nearly 4 hours coming back from the Grand Canyon, we were in need of a burger and fries.  As two chicks from the Northeast, we knew we had to get THE burger and fries.  Mcdonald's would just not do.  We decided to Yelp In N Out, and there it was, half a mile off the exit.  This location is laid out like any other In N Out location.  The basic menu was a glimmer of hope after a long and exhausting day.  The girl working the register was very nice and it turned out to be her first day.  I ordered a cheeseburger with animal-style fries, while my friend went with a double-double and regular fries.  The orders were a bit slow coming out but this is a place that makes everything fresh and I seemed to have forgotten that.  The food was good, as always.  It's hard to screw up the food here.  The service was friendly and the staff was singing along to songs playing on the radio (it was a quiet night, I can't fault them for that).  This definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"Absolutly disappointed. The food was great as expected but what this review is for, is for management. My family and flew to Vegas for my 21st birthday and were excited to see an In N Out, as we dont have one in Seattle. We sat outside and there are pigeons which is totally fine we love animals but what really disgusted me was the teenagers sitting adjacent to us throwing their used sauce packets at the birds, when we spoke up about it to them IN FRONT OF THEIR PARENTS they ignored us but figured they got the message. After about 10 minutes the parents left the kids and drove off. 5 minutes pass and they do the same thing as last time, this time hitting the bird. We spoke up AGAIN and they started arguing with us about it. So my mom got management to come out and do whatever they had to do, if that meant kicking them out or telling them to stop. Well that didnt go so well. They brought out what looked like their best friend as when he came out they greeted him by first name and gave him pats on the back as he told them quietly to \"chill out\" as soon as he left the kids laughed at us. Right after that they threw ANOTHER sauce packet and after that we didnt say anything, we just went inside and asked for the General Manager or a phone number we can talk to and were told that \"these are just how Las Vegas kids are\" we got outside and another older lady speaking to them telling them about respect for elders and soon after they left. The point is Management did absolutely nothing if the kid that was sent out even was management.  Food was good though."}
{"text":"The most fresh and perfect in-n-out I have ever had and Courtney at the window was literally amazing her voice was that of a angel. The most joyful fast food experience."}
{"text":"I say \"as good as it gets\" for fast food burgers standards! I will pick In-N-Out over any other fast food place.  Yeah I have had way better burgers, but not from a fast food place!"}
{"text":"The last stop I look forward to before leaving Vegas. You can never go wrong here. Check out their secret menu! !!! If it is your first time here and something is wrong take it right back up front and make them fix it! !! Don't let it ruin your first experience! !! Enjoy"}
{"text":"This has been my first time trying In-N-Out and I was impressed. The Chocolate Shakes and Cheeseburgers were great, but the fries were definitely lacking. I don't know how a  McDonald's could stay open here with SmashBurger, In-N-Out, Gordon Ramsay's BurgR, Jack In the Box, and Five Guys all over town."}
{"text":"It is GD In N Out and they are finally on the strip!!! I came from a thousand dollar dinner at é by Jose Andres and this is still good!!! GET IT!!!!!!  This was the freshest, hottest and tastiest double-double animal style I have ever had! Better try it before the line is around the block!"}
{"text":"Its In-N-Out fool!!! What else are you going to say!  Very Busy as most are but this one particularly so. Have no fear, Another one is opening up ON the Strip near the High Roller wheel! No more cab ride across the freeway!"}
{"text":"I dont see what everyone's fascination with In-N-Out is. Got a 4x4 and it was barely an \"Average\" fast-food burger, and the undercooked fries were probably the worst I've ever had anywhere.  In-N-Out Lovers really need to get out more!  #FoodPorn #InNOut #Crap"}
{"text":"Today, I went to In-N-Out Burger for lunch. I got a Cheeseburger Combo which included a Cheeseburger with Grilled Onion, Tomato, and Lettuce on a Toasted Bun, Fresh Hand Cut French Fries, and a medium Fountain Drink - Coca Cola products!  I liked how the beef patty was thin and the burger didn't make me feel bloated."}
{"text":"Lines are long sometimes but I mean that's at all in n outs. The staff is always friendly and super fast! The only reason I gave them 4 and not 5 stars is because they had 2 new people at the register who took almost 10 minutes trying to get our order right while another worker was taking orders at another register and instead of just taking us they got through the whole line and we ended up being the last ones helped, which meant our order took even longer to come out. I mean all we wanted was well done and we ended up in waiting close to 35 mins because everyone else's order was done before ours. But besides that the drive thru always goes super fast I love it."}
{"text":"After hearing about In-N-Out Burger for years, I finally was able to try it while on a trip to Phoenix.  Menu.  I walked inside and was immediately impressed with the simple menu: hamburger, cheeseburger, double-cheeseburger, fries, milkshakes, soda.  This is a burger restaurant, so why should they clog the menu with lots of other things--if I wanted to eat chicken or fish, I'd go to a place that specializes in those foods.  The simple menu made it really quick to decide what I wanted to eat.  Service.  The counterperson acted like a genuine human being--not the typical, fast-food robot.  From this point on, the word \"genuine\" repeatedly came to mind.  Food.  The cheeseburger was very good, but not exceptional.  I was pleased to read that the patty was not frozen, as would be expected.  The fries--which they said were freshly hand made--were exceptional.  I can't ever remember having fries that tasted this good anywhere--really crispy.  The chocolate shake was very smooth--also made from genuine ice cream instead of some powdered box mix.  It was definitely better than any other fast food milkshake I've tried.  Restaurant:  The restaurant was cleaner than most fast-food places as was the bathroom.  Overall:  I would certainly be happy to eat at In-N-Out Burger again."}
{"text":"How apropos is it that the first In-N-Out cheeseburger I ever had was in Sin City? Ten years of meat abstinence could not quiet my carnal urges. When I started eating meat again, I thought, \"Yeah, but I still will never ever eat a burger.\" Wrong. One bite and I was OBSESSED. I cannot believe I denied my tastebuds of such pleasure for so long.  Las Vegas, I blame you entirely for my newfound In-N-Out addiction. Thanks a lot. My fat ass thanks you too."}
{"text":"I'm from the East coast, we have a ton of places here that try so very hard to be In-N-Out and just don't do the job.  This isn't my first time at one, but it definitely has been a while.  This location is in the Linq Promenade.  It's terribly busy.  That's why I gave it 3 Stars.  Just sheer busyness makes it a bit annoying.  The food as always is top notch.  The burgers are delicious and the fries are as always very good.  Getting a seat is a bit of a chore.  Also, once you order, however long it took you to get to the register, double that time waiting for your food.  It is what it is, but honestly it's a good bargain for the Strip and a tasty meal."}
{"text":"Just like home!  Every time I'm visiting a place with In N Out I have to go because it always reminds me of home.  The food is awesome and the prices are amazing.  For a double double cheeseburger, single cheese, french fries and 2 shakes we spent $11.  The shakes are super thick and excellent on a warm Phoenix day."}
{"text":"This location is always busy but it's not a long wait. The staff is always so pleasant and the restaurant is clean. They have plenty of people taking orders and filling them."}
{"text":"Considering I was the Designated Driver tonight and had a truck full of not exactly sober people... I am pretty grateful that the person taking our order  had the skill to sort through it all. Almost like leading a group of school children through the ABC's she took charge and took down all the orders in a surprisingly timely fashion. The food was just how we ordered it (3x3 animal style, extra toast!) and as always it was sooooooo delicious. There was a bit of a line going through the drive through but I think if it's 1 AM on  Saturday in Vegas and drunk people don't want your food it probably means a lil something.   Will be back, probably tomorrow for breakfast, lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Let's get 1 thing straight. I love In N Out! so it pains me to write this...  I've had it in several states in the last 14 years. Its still one of my favorite spots.   People seem to get overly excited about the secret menu, and that's nice and all, but it's nothing new, far from secret, and definitely not a game changer...funny how people love to be in the know of anything that's supposedly \"secret\"..it's not illuminati folks!...lol ..(extra crispy fries, animal style, protein style, etc, etc) yes its good stuff but lets face it, the bragging rights component is far more important (to most people) than anything you'll consume, cause again, it's not overwhelmingly great...it's good though. I just laugh when I witness first hand the smugness and self satisfaction people experience as they share this \"life altering news\" as if they know some secret MI6 agent behind the counter that can \"hook them up, cause they are special\"... like disney dust to a 5 year old..all because they know the secret \"language\" lol..(out of towners that might have In N Out twice a year become cool kids all of a sudden)......Jheer ahsum dewd!  Ok so now that we have that out of the way, I would have given the review 5 stars, since In N Out is one of my top 3 burgers (along with Dicks in Seattle and 5 Guys), however the service at this specific location is so poor I had to average the score.  I've been to this location since they first opened years ago, and this place has really suffered a major decline..  Service here, especially at night, really sucks. They take waaaaaaaaaaay longer than  usual to fulfill your order, the place is never clean, homeless constantly pan handle at this location (they stand right next to the entrance and pan handle) and mgmt does nothing about it. The funny thing is, by comparison, they aren't THAT busy!  Is it because they are under staffed?  Whatever it is, it's VERY noticeable if you've ever eaten at In n Out before.   The pedestrian drive thru order taker is rarely there, and when they are, they can't get  to the entire line since the signal range on their device only goes up to 5 ft from the normal drive through speaker box (so what the F is the point?!?!?) Several times I'll provide my order to this drive thru walker, only to have them say, \"I'm sorry sir but something is wrong with our mobile system, just pull forward and provide them your order\"..an absolute waste of time further delaying the experience.....Other things that have happened here on several occasions: incorrect change given, incorrect order (who the hell messes up a plain cheeseburger?), overcharged, cold and stale fries, rude service, always forgetting items, salt, ketchup, napkins (drive thru), and massive delays...to name a few.  If I were to sum up THIS SPECIFIC In N Out location, it would be to compare it to that of a McDonald's....IN A WALMART!  And If you don't know what I'm talking about, go to any Walmart in Las Vegas, and dine in at the built in McDonalds, they all have them. It's what it sounds like, and what you would expect. Shitty on many levels. Sub Par even for Fast Food Standards...  Bottom Line: Save yourself some trouble and skip this location, head to Five Guys which is just up the road less than 2 mins north on LVB, or if you are set on In N Out, head to the Ft Apache or Tropicana location."}
{"text":"Oh yeah!!. Great burgers n great prices.....no good fries tho...hence the name lol....friendly n clean!"}
{"text":"amazing and wonderful especially the fact that the menu is so small and that always is easier for me!!!"}
{"text":"Because I spent 6 of the last eight days in SoCal, I had the chance to eat at different In-N-Outs for 6 days straight. I can tell you that the employees here have an enthusiasm & exuberance I'm not used to seeing in a fast-food environment"}
{"text":"Best burger: Nothing compares to a 4x4.   Frys: the more you eat them the better they become.   Staff: they have some secret sauce for finding the best staff. Staff is better than 98% of high end restaurants.   Love it!"}
{"text":"The best burger in the world is an in-n-out  4x4. Simply the best burger place bar none."}
{"text":"Simply the best burger in the world. The 4x4 burger that is. And the more I eat the fresh potato fries, the better they taste. You can tell they are real good.   Staff is simply unmatched. They are so good you think they might be Stepford staff - perfect in every way.   Simple. Tasty.  The Best food The Best staff"}
{"text":"Burgers here are the best. Getting in and out of this location, the worst. The location entry exit is convoluted. But the staff is awesome and the burger are still good. Worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Best fast food burger in the history of fast food burgers. Tiny menu: Hamburger, Cheeseburger, Double-Double, Fries, Shakes, and Soda. That's all! Perfect. Always a double double for me with a big fat stinky onion on it. Oh, and they seem to hire good kids... Pretty much always good fast food service."}
{"text":"I love you.  Currently, I reside in the midwest. Chicago suburbs: a land of mediocre burger joints and pizza places harboring only the most creepy felonious employees.  I need you; To send me a double double in a lettuce wrap with fries... animal style."}
{"text":"Double single animal style, protein style, with extra grilled onions, and spread on the side. Always fresh hot, and filling."}
{"text":"Consistently great, everywhere, predictable awesome, this was no exception. Love those little peppers, they are vegetable candy. I know I'm a strange  bird. Oh and  the service, nothing short of spectacular, they did not look at me like I was crazy when I asked for 10 packets of their In and Out sauce."}
{"text":"Yeah......I don't get it.  It's a burger joint.  I mean it wasn't bad but it was just OK.  I think I got caught up in all the \"hoopla\" about this place and was expecting more.  Granted the cost was on the money but the burger and the fries were kinda \"blah\".  I guess the old \"you get what you pay for\" adage holds true here.  I been here 3 times (twice because friends from out of town wanted to go there) and wasn't impressed any of the times.  To the East Coast people:  I will trade you ALL of the In-N-Out Burger restaurants for ONE White Castle."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is predictable. If that is the only thing a chain would be graded on then every location I have been to would be a 5. Every food item is always fresh but I think a bit short on flavor. The portions are not over kill nor is the price. It will always take longer than average for a burger place to get your order. My visit here was based on predictable being what I was in the mood for that day."}
{"text":"We are visiting az from New Mexico.... My husband is from California so he has been here. I have not... With that being said the food was great and everyone was super friendly!!! Thanks for a great experience!! :)"}
{"text":"Their burgers are always fresh and delicious, I think we can all agree, however, when it comes to getting food on the drive thru it's always packed and they sometimes take long to give us our food. Overall the service is good, however I'd change the way their drive thru service is"}
{"text":"In n Out vs. Whataburger  Dicks out everyone.    I've had many an argument as to the godliness of each and though I tend to stand in the In n Out camp when discussing this with my Texas friends, and contrastively with my West Coast friends, i stand firmly that each has its place near the high end of the hamburger spectrum.   Visiting In n Out  for the first time is like being a drunken male in some unfamiliar La Quinta bathroom in Reseda, California.  There seem to be limited options.    But once you get the feel of it, you realize that you can sit down to pee if you want.  You can use the towel rack to brace yourself.  You can pee in the bathtub or bypass all ration and lay in the damn tub like a newborn ... all kinds of stuff you would never do at your regular place.  Treat this place like that budget hotel.  This is not your regular place, this In n Out Burger.  Be creative.  Get nasty.  Try that 3x3 Animal Style with Animal Style fries.  Grilled onions?  Throw those bitches on.  Kick down with a Neapolitan shake ... and ... use that plastic, cos In n Out takes card now.  Word."}
{"text":"Mind control. It's the only reason I can think of that would make all of us believe that we can't live without In-N-Out.  Now, i'm from California so I get to have In-N-Out all the time, but my friend flew out from New York state to meet me in Vegas. We were out and about on a beautiful Saturday I need to stop off and get something fairly inexpensive but good to eat before kicking off the night's festivities. She had never been before so she trusted me to order for her. I got us a couple of Double Doubles with grilled onions, animal style fries, and chocolate milkshakes. I knew with this order I was creating another convert. Mission accomplished!  This location lives up to the high standard of all of the other In-N-Out locations. The food is fresh and tastes amazing. There really isn't anything quite like the food from this company. Or, at least that's what they make us think."}
{"text":"Inn n out is consistently good fast food with nice employees that are accommodating to customers with food allergies. It's pretty clean and the wait times are not terrible even when it's super busy. Always can recommend the well done fries! Try the secret menu!"}
{"text":"Is it the sauce? Or the meat? Can't be the buns hun cause sometimes I go protein style. Whatever causes a fluctuation in my brain to gravitate towards an In-N-Out, don't even wanna know.  The menu is simple, and they don't do breakfast or other foo foo stuff. Just honest to goodness burgers, shakes, n fries. Their slogan \"Ordering as easy as 1,2,3\" is exact. The \"secret menu\" is not so secure as most diners order a variety of ways to enjoy.  Founded in 1948, they have been pounding out great fresh food and thats most likely the key habit-forming ingredient. All I know, the urge to have an In-N-Out makes my car swerve to one, every now and then, although more often every time :)"}
{"text":"Love the menu and spirit of all involved, go In-N-Out. Don't forget to try the 4x4, Monster Style."}
{"text":"Andrea is sweet hostess. Love their menu and the food is top notch. Like I said menu is very limited but the burgers are to die for."}
{"text":"Haven't found many who don't like In n Out, and now there is one right up the street from my work, so found me a new lunch time spot!  Love me a cheeseburger & fries animal style and a good old chocolate shake! For you all that don't like burgers, they also make a bad ass melted cheese sammy, go crazy and make it animal style!!"}
{"text":"Well, I was really looking forward to this place because I always hear talk of this place among Hollywood folks. Well, I was meet by a young man name Kevin, working the register he was so patient with us.! We had all kinds of question because this was our first time!  I got the double double animal style with animal style fries. And a chocolate and vanilla mixed milkshake. I thought it was ok, and I did not like the fries at all. I just think the mustard infusion is not for me. Next time I will get regular. But the atmosphere was wonderful, it was noisy and jam packed! I loved it! I'm going to give this place another chance."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy! So glad I tried the double double!! The fries weren't as I expected The entire staff was friendly!  A great experience!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, fries and shakes for a \"fast food\" operation.  Always hot, fresh and flavorful.  This is the best choice for a fast fill-up.  The staff is actually friendly and helpful. The restaurant is clean and well maintained."}
{"text":"If you are on the south end of the strip, or staying at the Silverton Hotel and Casino and get hungry for a burger this is the place to go. I ordered a number one combo. It consists of a double double cheeseburger, fries and soda. I got the onions grilled.      The fries were salted well and the burger was stacked high. It smelled so good I could not even wait long enough to take a picture. The only thing holding me back from giving five stars is the burger could have had more grilled onions put on it."}
{"text":"Long drive threw lines SOMETIMES but    worth the   wait (: people don't mind lines when it comes down too eating a burger from here.  Easy menu."}
{"text":"First, I'd like to say I'm a California local, and I LOVE In-N-Out. Favorite burger place ever. I've been to many locations in California and have eaten in Nevada a couple times when I visited relatives in Las Vegas.  But this is the first time I'm reviewing an In-N-Out, because the service here really impressed me.  I was sitting eating my order, and I noticed an elderly man and his son had sat down at the table next to us. They had finished ordering and gathering their drinks, and the son had left to go to the restroom. There was a worker, her name was Kim, who had noticed that their order was finished and was called a few times. The son wasn't there and I dont believe the elderly man had heard through the general noise. I looked up and I saw she had looked for the elderly man and went out of her way to give him his food.   I thought this was just, genuinely really really great, especially with the general madness of how In-N-Out usually is. And ESPECIALLY considering how it was extra packed due to it being Black Friday. I don't really find or see that kind of service around, and I know it's small, but I thought it was thoughtful and great and was worth mentioning on a holiday that's become notorious for being crazy in the US (all those videos of crazy Black Friday shoppers you know).   And as always, the food was delicious.  Five stars for this service, the service of all the other workers (everyone was genuinely nice and helpful), and for awesome food!"}
{"text":"As fresh as any fan of In-N-Out Burger fan would expect. Same good service and same delicious chow. This spot can be easy to pass up, as its on the right heading east somewhat tucked away yet right in plain view if that makes any sense. You will see it as you pass it."}
{"text":"Best burger for your dollar hands down. Fresh French Fries, Delicious shakes and  low wallet damage equals five stars! Despite running into the expected long lines often, they move fast. Always friendly service and the ability to make...adjustments to your order put In-N-Out on the top of the burger list if the need for a fast one strikes. Oh yes, and the location right off the 95 and lake meade is great for convienence."}
{"text":"I have been to In-N-Outs in Cali and in AZ.  My niece from OH was craving it, so we all jump into the car and went.  I ordered the #2 (cheeseburger, fries, and a drink).  They still do not impress me, the cheeseburger was ok.  I love the fries but they have to be eaten fresh.  They taste soggy if you wait too long.   Smash Burger is still my love, sorry In-N-Out."}
{"text":"One of the best fast food restaurants in Vegas. Always hot and yummy!!! Get your fries well done if you like them crispy"}
{"text":"I discovered In-N-Out Burger in Tucson, so when I passed by the location in Chandler, I didn't pass up the opportunity to chow down. It was pretty busy inside so we were expecting a wait time similar to the one in Tucson. We placed an order and were told it would be about 15 minutes. The order was for 1 double, 2 singles, fries, and a Neapolitan shake. The order came out fast but the place was still hopping so we ate in the car, turned on an episode of Martin and we were in business. The burgers were so juicy with just the right amount of fat, everything tasted fresh on a toasted bun. The fries were not an afterthought, and were crisp with enough salt. The shake..the shake is what gets me every time, so velvety smooth, soft, and creamy. True to its ice cream counterpart, the shake was sectioned off to each of the flavors: chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. If you drink from the middle, you get all of the flavors in one! Yum. I don't think it's the best burger you could ever have in your whole life, but it's consistent, fresh, and mighty tasty."}
{"text":"OK, I know this chain is very popular but I gotta say I don't get it. The burgers are so generic and the fries look and taste like they are three days old.  I have been to several In N Out Burgers throughout Arizona and California so I know I have given them more than their fair shake at impressing me. One credit I can give them they are consistently disappointing."}
{"text":"Always a classic. Whether you stick with the original burger or select an item from the secret menu, you just cannot go wrong. I love it!!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch with my baby girl. Love their grilled cheese and always ask for extra cheese! Love this place. Staff is always so friendly."}
{"text":"My first time ever to eat at In & Out.  The place was absolutely packed.  The kitchen area seemed to be extremely efficient with everyone just busting their butts at every single spot possible.  I ordered the Double Double with fries and was presented with a really solid burger.  Ate with hot peppers and a little bit of extra sauce to dip in.  Whenever I'm close to an In & Out, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. Puts the Californian stores to shame with their quality especially on protein style burgers. They really only employ the best people. If only everything in America was as good as this In N Out."}
{"text":"This is one of the newer In and Out Burger locations and it sits on the corner of a big retail area near the county line. Overall, there is really no way to go wrong with In and Out. Every one of the locations offers the same thing.  The value is great which makes it popular with snowbirds. Five bucks for a single cheeseburger value meal is cheaper and better than McDonalds.  The place is crowded and every time I've been there service has been slow. But for me it is not really an inconvenience. People generally order a lot of food when they go there, like for an entire family, so the orders are large.   The bathrooms are extremely clean and from what I can tell the whole place is. Usually I eat outside under the umbrellas. Great place, great burger, definitely better than Five Guys."}
{"text":"I love in and out it is my favorite burger joint they have the best burgers and fries the only thing is they are so busy but I understand cause there so damn good"}
{"text":"My first stop when I touch down. It's always crowded but the line move quickly. Not much on the menu but burgers, fries, soft drinks and milk shakes. I always get the cheeseburger animal style (grilled onions and extra sauce). It's always prepared hot and fresh. The cashier was really nice as well. We were planning to eat outside so she had our meals put in boxes instead of the usual bags which made things much easier. The service and food here is always consistently great which is why I'm a repeat customer."}
{"text":"It's pretty tasty, though normal speed for a fast food place which is funny given the name. Definitely worth a try"}
{"text":"Great big burgers at reasonable prices. Their shakes are great too and this location also has a gift shop next to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Being from the east coast, anytime I head out west I have to get In n Out right after I get off the place. After picking up our rental car from Phoenix airport, we drove over right away. I always order a cheeseburger animal style with french fries and a milk shake. I know... extreme gluttony but sooo worth it!!! Besides that, the price can't be beat. Everything is so fresh. If I wasn't such a city girl, I would move to AZ for the beautiful scenery. Just amazing!"}
{"text":"Just like everyone else says. This place has some of the best tasting burgers and fries. Although the choices aren't vast like the other burger places, whatever you get will be delicious, and inexpensive. I haven't yet tried the secret menu items, but definitely will the next time. I had the cheeseburger and fries combo, which cost about 6 bucks, and it filled me up. Really fast service too. Wish they opened in Hawaii!"}
{"text":"I've probably been there at least 100 times. It never gets old. Just remember not to let the food sit too long. Fresh food gets cold and soggy fast. Eat inside or in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Great made to order burgers for $2. My favorite is to order double double protein style and Neapolitan Neapolitan milk shave. Cool employees and fast drive through. Can't miss this place off Craig rd. You can order tried well done for an extra crisp texture. Easy menu to navigate. Decent and clean restroom. Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Cruised though the drive-thru on our way to see a movie at the nearby Desert Ridge AMC theater. Typically In-N-Out is quick, delicious, and way better than McD's. Sadly, this was not one of those nights.   We ordered three burgers, three drinks, and an order of fries for the three of us and requested the orders be placed in separate bags so we could take (smuggle) the food into the movie theater (we were pressed for time and starving, okay?!). The order took longer than usual to pick up at the window and when I asked which was the burger with ketchup and mustard (instead of the \"special sauce\") the server just stared at me blankly and said I should be able to tell. Right, but I was hoping to figure it out before biting into my friend's burger! Thankfully I don't have a food allergy so it wasn't a big deal, but still kinda annoying that our burgers got swapped and we couldn't figure out which was which.   I think I'll stick with my usual In-N-Out in Tempe, thank you!"}
{"text":"Living in Hawaii, I try to eat as much In-N-Out Burger when I'm in the West Coast and Shake Shack when I'm in New York. I think the burgers at In-N-out taste really good with the veggies being fresh. I like the service too and how they ask if I want onions with the burger. I don't and I usually forget to order without onions at order burger joints. So I just remove them. The shakes are good too but i usually order the secret menu one. Over all, I think they have the best value burger with the freshest ingredients. Shakes too!"}
{"text":"I love In and Out. The menu is simple but everything is delish. It is very hard to get a table at all times but the crowd is worth it. The drive through backs up about 15 cars during lunch. The line goes pretty fast though."}
{"text":"Great food -- it's a chain, so no surprises here -- but the drive thru line is always slow."}
{"text":"Just as predictable and standard as every other 100 In-n-out's I've been to in the past 20 years. Good predictable food.... and nothing more... go figure, it is fast food."}
{"text":"Always  an OK location. One of these days they will get my order right but and in and out burger is never horrible. Line is too long to take it back"}
{"text":"I stopped at In-N-Out for dinner on the road and I got both good food and good service. When I first came in, there was quite a line to order food, but I've never not had a long line at an In & Out. I ordered the standard burger and fries to go with extra pickles and mustard packets and I waited about 15 minutes for my order. The cashiers were super friendly and very helpful when ordering. My order came out perfectly and I loved my burger, but I'm starting to think that I'm not a fan of this restaurant chain's fries, they're usually soggy and not very salty. Anyways, I enjoyed this location and I would come back."}
{"text":"I don't eat very much fast food.  I tend to cook at home most nights.  When I'm in a state that has In-N-Out Burger, though, I make an exception.  Truth be told, I've never thought of In-N-Out Burger as fast food.  It is true diner quality -- which is a compliment.  I'm talking about the diners of yesteryear.  When diner food was like home cooking, but with a much bigger grill!  I've been to a number of In-N-Out Burger's in my day.  Something I appreciate at each location is just how much the staff seems to enjoy their job.  Now, I don't have much fast food experience.  I don't know what it's like at one of the big chains, like McDonald's or Burger King -- but I've heard from friends who have worked at one of those places that it is a fairly thankless job.  I've never met a person, sans an owner of a McDonald's franchise, who said they loved to work for the golden arches.  But, people who work for In-N-Out Burger are always so...jovial.  It's actually quite jarring.    This location is no exception.  It opened at 1030AM.  We were there at 10AM because we were driving into town and figured it would be easier to wait than to drive back at a later time.  At 10AM, they were already helping customers and making orders.  Why? Because they had a line of people and cars that was there before we arrived at 10AM and they want to make their customers happy.  A simple philosophy that seems to be too often forgotten these days.  Of course, everyone seems to know about the secret menu, so I won't explain my order to anyone.  We got:  Double Double  Animal Style - it was exactly what we hoped it would be.  Flavorful, juicy, well-cooked and delicious!  These burgers really stand the test of time, as well, due to a wonderfully sweet and decently dense bun.  Fries Well-Done Animal Style - These fries are a gift from whatever god you believe in. Secret sauce, grilled onions, cheese and deliciously crisp fries make for a mouth-watering experience.  All in all, a great location that went above and beyond to take care of its customers.    As an aside, for us, 1030AM equated to 1230PM since we live in Texas and had just driven into town.  Watching all these college kids eat burgers and fries for breakfast -- well, I wept for my love of pancakes and bacon.  Another aside, most In-N-Out Burger locations still don't know the \"On the Sal\" secret menu item.  It's a side salad with secret sauce (a bit like thousand island but better).  So, order it whenever possible!  :D"}
{"text":"I was never really a fan of Hamburgers so my review won't be just on the food.   The Bad about this place.  Very crowded. Huge lines. No place to sit because of the crowds. Had to sit outside in 100degree Vegas heat. I think thats all I can think of...  The Good Very quick service for these kind of lines.  The burgers and fries tasted just like the ones we have at home in Los Angeles. Maybe alittle better even on the burger or maybe I was just hungry. Extra bathrooms in their second building for merchandise."}
{"text":"Worst In N Out I've ever been to. They repeated my order back to me 3 times correctly and then I get it and it's wrong. No animal style fries, I had already paid and even though they made the mistake insisted I paid the difference for the fries. Then the second hamburger I ordered plain they added animal style to it... um, I didn't realize this job was that hard? Lol will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Finally had this for the first time.   I was surprised at how cheap it was! These burgers are seriously a great deal. It comes with onions, lettuce, cheese, tomato, the usual - and they have their special thousand island-tasting sauce. The fries are pretty good too, especially when dipped wit the burger sauce. It's not the best burger out there, (there are many others I would recommend in my own city), but I still like it.   Not sure how I feel about the service, it wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. The manager came to our table to randomly talk to us, and he came back about another 2-3 times to talk and ask questions while we were eating, and gave us some hats. I thought he was just bored or really liked us because he we were from out of town, I don't know - but when we finished our food he asked us if we had a working phone, and to call a certain number so that we could put in a good word for him. I forget his name now, but he was very demanding about it. Now we know why he talked to us for so long... and he said we HAD to call that number while we were still in the restaurant. When we said we would do it later he still insisted that we do it right then and there which made us feel a little uncomfortable... tsk tsk.  Anyway, I would definitely come here again for those burgers.  Hmmm debated between 3 or 4 stars for a while now, but I will do 4 for the good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"This is always my fix when coming to Vegas. Yes, scratching my neck and everything. Double Double, animal style fries and a banana pepper. Who needs a drink when there's open container laws. God forgive me."}
{"text":"Today I stopped in for a double double. I was starving and this is usually one of my favorite quick go to spots. Today was different though. Today whoever made my burger was a god sent down from the heavens to make the best in n out double doubles ever made. I travel all over through Cali and have stopped at so many in n outs and I'll tell you today by far was the best burger I've ever had. The bun had the most perfect amount of crunch and crisp consistency and there was the perfect amount of lettuce and cheese and sauce ratio. Just awesome. Great job!!!! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Good fresh made burger. Fresh made french fries from fresh potatoes. Great beef und fresh salad"}
{"text":"Though my recent visit to In-N-Out Burger was my first and only visit, I'm already sold on it. For years I've been hearing about their simple but delicious menu and freshly made food. All I can tell you is that it lived up to the expectations I had. My burger was made fresh and I could tell that the patty hadn't been previously frozen. As my meal was being prepped, I could see the kitchen crew cutting fresh French fries in the back. My milkshake was thick, chocolatey and creamy - just how I like it. I have no doubt that I'll be hitting up In-N-Out Burger each and every chance I get... In fact, I may have to make a trip back to the the southwestern U.S. for that purpose alone!"}
{"text":"Really!!!!!! Don't go to this one late at night. I have no idea what the problem was. There was one..... only one car in-front of us. By the time we got to the window it was clear how disorganized they are. It took another 3 min for them to check us out... we used cash for the one shake. The shake sat an arms length away while he stopped checked us out and helped another customer. Maybe..... just maybe help the customer you are in the middle of helping. Quality is better than quantity!"}
{"text":"Love their burgers and fries so much. Their burgers are so juicy and served fresh unlike McDonald's near by, I'd rather buy my meal here instead especially since it's served fresh and actually looks like a burger."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite burger joint.  Always get the cheeseburger with everything.  Fries are tasty.  Service is always good, expect a little wait because this location is very busy.  I knocked one star off due to access.  If you are not a local you will get frustrated trying to get into the parking lot.  The first to time you visit expect to make at least one illegal u-turn or be prepared to crawl over a block wall from the neighboring parking lot.   LOL"}
{"text":"Good burgers but the fries were quite soggy."}
{"text":"Great fast food place! The animal fries are some of the best I've ever had! Great food all around."}
{"text":"We come here at least once a week. Our favorite burger spot hands down. Yes, we love those expensive gourmet burgers but nothing seems to compare. You can never have too much In N Out!"}
{"text":"Got their cheeseburger with monster fries and a vanilla shake- YUMMY!!!  The perfect afternoon snack!!  :)    Burger was served hot with fresh lettuce and tomato, and the fries were crispy, and the shake super thick!!"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service I got my food with in like 5 minutes and it's always delicious. MY FAV IN-N-OUT"}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait for your burger. The burger is okay. The fries are really great for a fast food burger joint.  If you're going to walk here from the strip, you might find walking west along W Tropicana a little... errr... exotic. You go under an overpass and there's a big collection of rape-y looking homeless men living under the overpass. I'm sure they're not rape-y and all fine and all. Just victims of the global economy, Obama, the Illumanti, chemtrail makers, whatever. But they do smell like a lot of urine. So. Factor that into your appetite. It might be a longer walk but use W Harmon, which takes you on the overpass (as opposed to under it) and then proceed south along Dean Martin."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like In and Out burger? It's always good! Me and my family love coming here because we can all get a good amount of food for reasonable prices. It's usually really it's but it goes quickly so don't let it deter you."}
{"text":"I've had the best fast food experiences here, in n out is known for their excellent customer service so what I've experienced is not uncommon.  I can't remember a time that my order was wrong and even the long lines aren't as much of a drag as other fast food places.  Couldn't recommend their food enough, the double double is my favorite."}
{"text":"Love the food!! The wait is the only downside. Definitely the best fast food burgers."}
{"text":"Still the best burger I've ever had..fast food OR sit down.  IN-N OUT, you never let me down. Just please, please come to Denver soon."}
{"text":"Believe the hype about this place! This is my favorite fast food place on earth. The burgers are delicious and always contain fresh ingredients. I love the thousand island sauce also!  I even got to try the fries \"animal-style\" (thousand island sauce, grilled onions) YUMMMM! When I was visiting Vegas I made it a point to come here and stuff my face, for I did not know when I'd be able to enjoy this place again.  Although this location was crowded and chaotic it was well worth it to feed my burger craving again. Hopefully next time I don't have to wait almost 2 years for my next.  In-n out needs to come to Denver!"}
{"text":"Great, fast service. We even got help taking our order to our table.  Menu is simple & reasonable but perfect. Order the \"Animal Style\" (it's not on the menu) for your burger or fries or both. I say the sauce is like a Big Mac sauce. We loved it. In n Out, please come to Oahu!!"}
{"text":"This place severely needs a major edit in Yelp's database to earn anything over 4 stars.  To label this place \"fast food\" is terribly misleading and for me to enjoy it, I have to erase this thought from my head.  Every time I go here, I get mentally prepared to wait at least 20 minutes to get my food whether I dine in or go to the drive thru.   Once you get prepared and realize this is not a fast food place, you then have to judge the food.   The burgers are greasy and tasty but definitely do not compare to a grilled giant patty at numerous other restaurants here in town.  The ingredients are fresh but somehow always manage to fall out from the burger no matter how fancy In-&-Out wraps them.    The fries are tiny and average.  They are so small, I often find myself having to pinch a number of them just to get a substantial bite.  Also the tiny size of them tend to lead to getting ketchup on the fingertips when dipping.    Another thing that has always bugged me about this place is the incredible crassness and smugness that many patrons exhibit by knowing about the \"secret menu.\"  Newsflash people...There is nothing secret about any menu since the advent of the internet.     Bottom line, this place is okay if you have at least 20 minutes to kill.  Just don't expect to be \"In & Out\"."}
{"text":"More like In and stuck in the friggin drive thru Waiting 20 min!!! slowest fast food place I have ever been to!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food, always fresh and lines move quickly. In and out burgers are always busy due to the taste and quality. I love how this one moves like a well oiled machine!  Great staff and teamwork seen every time we go!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with In-N-Out, other than the wait time. For fast food it is 5 stars all the way! I am not saying it is 5 star for fine dinning but their burger's IMHO are better than Five Guys and others that are in the area."}
{"text":"believe the hype. yes, it's super crowded, but staff makes quick work of the crowd. as busy as it is, order comes out correct and with a smile. given that it's slightly off the Strip, it's relatively hidden all things considered. grab a bite, find a bench, and enjoy 30 minutes of people watching while sorting out your next move."}
{"text":"Came here very late at night around midnight after picking up some friends up from the airport. I ordered an Animal Style Fries and a Strawberry shake. Both food items were really good. It's the same at every In-N-Out Burger (the set up the spot is even like the one I live at). The food was good and really hit the spot at the time. The Shake was nice and thick as well and tasted very good! Overall, solid spot and I enjoyed it overall."}
{"text":"Always good for the price and a good example  of what a fast food burger should taste like"}
{"text":"Quality still very high, burgers always fresh and tasty, secret menu always fixed to perfection, staff pays attention to make sure your order is right. Great job all around."}
{"text":"The oh so famous in n out burger!! This is a very busy location so  be prepared to wait a little."}
{"text":"YASSS!!  This was the best find of the night! We landed really late and were scouring the strip for food. We had to resist the urge to run in when we saw this ON THE STRIP. This location is really new and just opened a few days ago.   I ordered a double double with grilled onions, animal style fries (gotta have that) and a Neapolitan shake. Delicious!    Sorry Shake Shack, In-N-Out will always win in my book!"}
{"text":"Honestly my first five star review ever. And this is over sit down resturants.  The food is always perfect the fries are the best in the country and the service is always fantastic. Everyone smiles and is always on point.  Love love love the place. So glad it's in Arizona ."}
{"text":"This is one place I have to go to everytime I get out to Vegas or California. I just love their burgers and fries.  I finally got to try part of their not so secret menu during my last visit.....the Animal style on a double cheeseburger.  Wow was that good! The place is clean, its got great service and its cheap eats! You'll understand after you've been there.....Instant Fan!"}
{"text":"It is tucked back off the strip a little bit by the LINQ hotel, down a little ally lined with shops right by the Ferris wheel. It is a great burger and fries - extremely fresh ingredients! The menu is just burgers and fries - keeping it simple and perfect! They have a healthier option of protein style - burger comes wrapped in lettuce instead of a burger. If you haven't even eaten at an in-n-out, it is a must try, and an extremely affordable meal on the strip!"}
{"text":"Good old in n out. Tasty, fast, animal style and very centrally located. Keep it up! This place is always a good stop after movies. Drive thrus are fast as well."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is pretty consistent anywhere you go. This location is somehow even a little quicker and cleaner than average."}
{"text":"Despite the busy late night rush, I received the upmost professional and understanding customer service. I ordered the wrong burger and there was a huge line. I asked the lady handing out the orders if she could alter the burger to a double double instead of a cheeseburger if it wasn't made yet. I offered to wait in line and pay for it, but all I wanted to do was place the order so I wouldn't have to wait any longer than I waited. She said she would take care of it and asked the grill person whom kindly nodded and gave her that okay.  Great team work and great service! Thank you In n out!"}
{"text":"Hit the spot, just what I wanted. This time I went really easy, double hamburger. Quick & easy. Good service. However, I did receive 7 dimes as change instead of fewer coins."}
{"text":"Paper hats. Giant safety pins for aprons. 13+ employees scurrying about.  Those were my first impressions upon entering my first In-N-Out Burger, to eat for the first time.  I've had many times over the years to try In-N-Out on various trips to try this chain but have never really been interested.  Today, however, I decided to see what all the fuss was about.  Service was impeccable.  Restaurant was incredibly clean.  Food was a notch above typical fast food.  I enjoyed my cheeseburger, though I'm not a huge fan of the \"special\" sauce (too sweet).  I appreciated the fresh lettuce and tomato.  And I really liked how the wrap your burger to make it simple to eat.  I don't really like fries, so I didn't have those.    All in all, I would definitely choose this place over the national fast food burger chains.  But, I won't crave it nor will I go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"I had a single cheeseburger animal style. My hubby had a double double animal style. We shared an order of extra dark, as they call it, or extra crispy fries. It was phenomenal as always! The staff was happy and cheerful -  as always - service was good - place was clean! What more can I say? It's In and Out!"}
{"text":"Uhhh it's In n Out! Need I say more! Always polite, never messed up my order, and when I was pregnant with my son and very ill with chronic vomiting the entire time... Their French fries were one of the few things I could eat because they are real potatoes and hardly oily!! This one has a long drive thru line during busy times by it goes by quick because the workers are friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"Spectacular as usual. I guess as long as they stick to the recipe it would be difficult to screw it up.   Went through the drive through and they were pleasant as usual!"}
{"text":"This place is good, BUT way way overrated. I have tried this place now 5 times or way and just not as good as everyone makes it out to be. It's good but way way overrated. It's not really any different then a normal burger joint and the animal sauce is just ok by the way."}
{"text":"I go to this location about one a month.  The food is always great,  but when they are in busy time,  drive through can be extremely slow (waiting 10 minutes for 3 cars?).  The only part bothers me with that is the employees don't apologize for the delay,  when is happens.  If I don't catch busy time,  they are fast :)"}
{"text":"Animal style.. Most overrated burger joint ever.. Don't believe the hype.. It's cheap tho!"}
{"text":"Each time I come to Vegas, I stop by In and Out for the Animal Style burger. I don't usually eat burgers; but this is a MUST HAVE!"}
{"text":"When I die and go to burger heaven this is what it will look like. In and out said screw you to the big chains and kept it simple burgers and fries and shakes.  But do they do it well. The burgers are some of the most flavorful and moist. They spend a moment and make the burger look pretty dang close to the picture, compared to burgers from other chains that barley stay together. Get your burger animal style with some more sauce and sit back and enjoy burger food coma. The fries are good but not great, but one can tell the difference in the fact they cut the fries on site. In and out please come to the East Coast ( Maine would love to have you !)"}
{"text":"Great location. Great service. Great food.  5 minutes drive from our Westin Kierland Resort. This location is one of the few restaurants in the area that open late at night. The two other restaurants we went to closed their kitchen at 12am, and only kept their bar area open until 2am. We arrived at this In-N-Out at 12:40am, and we were greeted right away at the drive-through. The service was great, and we didn't wait long for our food. The burgers were usual IN-N-OUT burgers that we get back in California, and so was the animal style fries.   In-N-Out never disappoints us. #proudcalifornians"}
{"text":"So maybe I'm easy to please.. but In N Out is my personal favorite burger spot in Vegas.  It's actually my favorite \"fast food\" restaurant.  Parking:   is good, and this location's pretty safe. Star 1 :]  Cleanliness:  When it's not super busy & under staffed, In N Out is usually well maintained (including the restroom) so.. Star 2 :]  Service:  Staff members are always well mannered & greets always with a smile.. Star 3! :]  Food:  Double double with fries cooked to tasty goodness.. & a neopolitan shake from real ice cream? Star 4.  Atmosphere:  It's casual, and I love the laid back feeling when I'm going to devour something tasty. Star 5.  I wish there was a location near Red Rock Casino! ;D"}
{"text":"So I've written for In-N-Out before.. but not at this joint.  So I came in around 11am looking for a snack hehe. More like EARLY lunch. My friend had already decided upon her order, & the cash reg' lady was quick on it. Good.  I love In-N-Out. Everybody & your future kids know that. What irks me this time.. The cash register lady was becoming impatient with me.. waiting for me to take my order in the most nicest way possible.  It's too bad I can read right through ya, sis.   I mean, there's no one else behind me, and you probably just started your shift, so can you give me a minute to order?  In-N-Out = 4 stars. Cash reg lady= No star."}
{"text":"For our first in-out experience I suppose we were hoping for out of this world food but what we got was a pretty good burger (with way too much onion, and we like onion), a really good shake, and crap fries all for a decent price. I don't know that we will ever go back but it was worth trying it once and defiantly worth the price for a night that we didn't want to spend strip prices on dinner!!!"}
{"text":"As an East Coast native I had to try In-N-Out while visiting. The selection was pretty limited compared to what I was expecting, however I did find out they have a secret menu. It varies with a selection of grilled cheese, to loaded fries. The atmosphere was cute and vintage. The employees were very friendly and proper. As far as food goes it was good, but I'm still more a fan of Shake Shack"}
{"text":"This is the pinnacle of fast food. As a visitor in a location deprived of In-N-Out, this is a must go!  The standard order for me is the double-double with grilled onion, animal style fries, and a medium drink (pretty ordinary stuff). It is so much cheaper than any restaurant you would find on the Las Vegas strip and the overall satisfaction of the quality of food often surpasses. The only criticism I have for this place is that it is so popular which sometimes can make the food come out slower. With that said, it is definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"After driving for hours to Las Vegas, the boyfriend and I wanted something quick to eat and to stretch out our legs. The place wasn`t too busy, but wasn`t dead, and service was quick.  We ordered two Double Doubles with onions (one Animal Style for the boyfriend) and two Animal Style Fries. Yes, I said two. Being in the car for a couple hours with no food makes you pretty hungry and irritated. We inhaled everything and everything was so good.  Full and satisfied. Now off to play on the Strip!"}
{"text":"Looking for simple then it's all about In-N-Out. Service is always good and quick. Got a double-double with some animal style fries and it was pretty satisfying."}
{"text":"Right next to UNLV this IN N Out was an easy stop for driving thru and getting my double double. It's far enough from the strip to avoid all the traffic, and close to the Convention Center and University if you have business there.   Service was friendly as usual. Food came up quick and was delicious. My double double was hot and tasted great!  Easy in and out to the street."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate it higher, but as a vegetarian.... there aren't any options (sans the soda!). I've heard good things and I wish I could partake, but alas until they expand their menu (which they probably won't ever do, so kudos to them for sticking to tradition!) I can't be a part of this craze."}
{"text":"Well done, animal style, no pickles. That's all that needs to be said."}
{"text":"It's in n out. If you like it, you like it. if you don't, you don't. I like it. It gets crowded though. I go during nonlunch/dinner hours."}
{"text":"RECOMMENDED: My car got sucked into the drive thru by the intergalactic tractor beam so I had to appease it by ordering a Double-Double and some well done fries!  In-N-Out is part of what makes the West Coast the West Coast. I love that they make their burgers fresh to order and only use fresh meat. The fries took a little to adjust to, since I had grown accustomed to the crap other burger joints put in their fries. Not In-N-Out... You can see them cutting up whole potatoes to make their fries.   In-N-Out is known for their \"secret\" menu. My advise is to ask someone in the know or simply read the comments on the listing here in Yelp for some hints and insight.   My personal favorites are the Double Double or the Triple Triple. Simply put... That's 2 patties with 2 slices of cheese or 3 patties with 3 slices of cheese!  I order mine Animal style!  Ask for this and you'll certainly never order it off the menu again.   The North Scottsdale location is easy to get to. It's always clean and the staff is impressive!  It's hard to beat In-N-Out in the fast food burger niche. Enjoy ;-)"}
{"text":"Close to the strip, cheap and yummy, what else can you ask for?!  Even though I'm not the biggest burger buff, I can't deny that their fries well-done and animal style are dangerously addicting... I'm embarrassed to face my former health-conscious, vegetarian self, to be quite honest."}
{"text":"Wow! What a line! I now its good, but wow! They are working hard to get all those orders out. Check In 7:08PM. Order 7:12PM, food in hand 7:21pm. That's pretty good for the massive rush they had."}
{"text":"Love in and out. I eat there last night at 930 pm.  The staff was having too much fun.  They were so loud.   It was funny.  It didn't appear they had a manager on duty.   But one it the staff said Gwen Stephani is carrying Blake Shelton's baby.    HILARIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"Usually could eat in n out all day everyday but the last three times I've been here the buns have been over toasted and burnt to the point I don't want to eat it anymore."}
{"text":"It's SOOO good! I can't believe we don't have a shot with In-N-Out in our neck of the woods. Seriously?!  So, you know what you're having. A burger. Fries. Maybe on the wilder side. A drink. You've done it again, and you'll be back.  It amazes me, cause, after Holsteins, and watching a crowd of 4 down $60 worth (4 beers) of Bud Light, less than $10 for two to eat is just such a treat.  Now, the real trick..... how do I get across that freeway? It's tough walking, we couldn't figure it out. Rented a car. Ha.  Thanks for listening!"}
{"text":"We stopped on the way from Sedona to the Phoenix Airport on the way back from honeymoon. This was my first time eating In N Out and it was delicious.  The burger was the best fast food burger I have ever had... It's all about the cheese and sauce.  Coming from a land of disgusting fast food and people too lazy to get out of their cars, I was shocked that the restaurant was so busy.  People were piled in there waiting for food and tables.   We would have had a table sooner if it weren't for the people sitting next to it with their knives out and open just laying on the table.  They were weirdly eyeing everyone.  I would think that a manager would ask them to put their weapons away but I guess they didn't want to be stabbed either.   Otherwise, we enjoyed our food and met another couple there from Tennessee trying it for the first time too.  That was neat! I would definitely come back here again and order an even bigger burger."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Service is always perfect!! All the employes are so nice and keep dining area clean! Good is always amazing!"}
{"text":"Order the animal style burger!! With regular fries (I used to get animal fries also but it's a little too rich having both) best burger on the west coast and I just wish we had one on the east coast! A-MAZING!"}
{"text":"Animal style is something special. I really enjoyed the animal style double cheesburger. It has a taste that is somewhat similar to a big mac.   The animal style fries were a bit much for me because they were somewhat soggy and I ate in the establishment."}
{"text":"Burgers and fries. Burgers and fries. Oh my!!! This hit the spot after a night on the town for the whole group of girls I was with. The fries were pretty good. The burgers come with lettuce and tomato. There is an animal style French fru option that has some In and Out special sauce (looks like thousand island) and some onions and velveeta cheese."}
{"text":"My partner and I love In-N-Out for a quick meal when we don't feel like cooking.   Pros: 1. It's close to the house 2. Service is always fast 3. Prices are great 4. Protein style! Cons: 1. I'm not a fan of their fries 2. The shakes could be better  Overall, if you're looking for a quick filling meal in a pinch In-N-Out hits the spot."}
{"text":"This busy location was not able to keep up with the crowd on a weekend. We ordered take out: burger, animal fries, regular fries, shake and a drink. Not hard right. Well they call us up and they are missing the regular fries and the shake. The proceed to just grab a half melted shake from the line and give it to us.   I know better than to go to this location again."}
{"text":"I had to find out what all the hoopla was about with this fast food place. Since this is not on the East coast we tried this on our vacation drive before heading to Sedona. The hamburgers are good, exceptional customer service, non harried environment. My only vice are the fries. I saw the water dripping potato get smashed into slicer. Not sure if they are first dried before they hit the fryer but they come out mushy not crispy outside. Wilty french fries are not our thing. The shakes are too thick at first to slurp thru straw, it needs to thin out with defrosting."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I ate In-N-Out here in Arizona and I'm proud to say that it was delicious. I've never been a fan of burgers, but In-N-Out was always the exception when I lived in California. It's something about the buns that make it so yummy. Anyways, I ordered a #2: a cheeseburger, fries, and a medium drink. Of course I animal styled them fries. Mm! So mouth watering. Their pink lemonade is really great too. If you're ever here, definitely give it a try.  The prices are so affordable. I never really checked out the prices when I used to live in California because I was never the one to buy the food so I never noticed how cheap everything is. I mean, it's seriously affordable. The meal is about $5.30 (+ tax) which is a normal meal price I guess, but the quality of the food is just perfect that you truly get your money's worth.  Another thing I love about this place is the staff. They are so sweet and outgoing. They're awesome! Anyone who is reading this must stop by at this In-N-Out and enjoy a delightful meal with friends or family."}
{"text":"How much can you expect me to remember in Vegas other than i know i was there. Only hospitals use more bright lights and i was a few drinks away from that. But i did eat at In-N-Out.   I've heard the hype about In-N-Out since i was in high-school. I got my chance and they're close to the best. No, wait...no, I haven't had a fast food burger as good. They make em' quick and hot; and may i add it keeps you coming back. Before your mind wanders any further away from these burgers--with buns so delicious you can kiss them as you caress, sauce oozing out, and lots of meat to excite you into returning for more. A heavy napkin should conclude this festivity depending on where your mind is. What happens in Vegas stays on Yelp.  By the way, two words: Animal Style! Very much worth it."}
{"text":"No thanks to Facebook and Twitter where people in the East Coast hear about In-N-Out on a regular basis.  Imagine my surprise that I discovered an In-N-Out in Phoenix when I thought they were only in California.  Man, I have to say that their simple burgers are among the best that I've had!  Freshness does make a whole world of differences."}
{"text":"The food is great when they do it right but otherwise my orders are mostly wrong. I get cold buns and burnt patties and when I ask for ketchup they forget most of the time. I would recommend another in n out."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Fresh and great customer service. Very accommodating in customizing each burger. We love the \"off menu\" items. Animal style, protein style, and more."}
{"text":"Went through drive through and ordered a double double protein style to go (very messy). I ordered it to eat in my car and they bagged it instead. Not only that, but they also neglected to give me napkins, ask if I wanted ketchup, etc.  Normally happy with In&Out but this place screwed up. Next time I'm here I'll happily update my review with the new experience."}
{"text":"Yumm! I love this place! Best food and all fresh. Never had a bad experience or bad food ."}
{"text":"It seems like everyone and then some was here to eat! This place is super busy but it is amazing how clean they keep it they have plenty of people on staff to get through the line quickly. It took a little bit to get our food but that is to be expected. The restaurant is beautiful and the staff really tries hard to do keep it clean. We even had someone attempting to smoke in the outside seating and the security from In-N-Out came out and told them to please put that out. Great job Mr security! We really appreciate that you guys really made this restaurant feel like they think the customers are really important. Try the 3 by 3 animal style with animal fries...You will love it!"}
{"text":"I had heard about these in n out burgers before, so I was excited to try them. I was very disappointed. The buns tasted chemical, the ingredients were nothing special and the fries were soggy and chemical. Just another low class American fastfood chain. Never again!"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious burgers. Ingredients, including the beef seem to be a step or two above the other fast food places. Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Customer service is great. However I come here all of the time. They need someone outside taking orders. Here now and people are pulling out of the line going next door to del taco."}
{"text":"In-N-Out was on my list of west coast fast food joints to check out on my trip.  I don't even eat hamburgers, but I liked it.  First, I LOVED the limited menu.  I hate when you give to many options to people, and they take forever.  My friends liked their burgers, so I'm guessing its good.    I ordered the fries, and they were probably the only fries I ever had that tasted like potatoes.  I really liked them, and the odd but normal taste of potatoes was good.    The place was swamped, but everyone had their orders in a couple minutes.  Bonus points for the counter boy who brought me my fries with a smile."}
{"text":"In Phoenix for a business trip and saw In-N-Out Burger and had to try it. If I didn't, I would have regretted it on my flight back to Boston. I have heard a lot of good things from friends and relatives that live in or visited California. So, I thought I would try it out.   I went in and I liked the overall theme of a classic american burger joint. It had a very old school red and white pattern that made me feel like it was one of those old burger and milkshake venues. This is made the place feel retro and inviting. I asked the cashier for the most popular meal, because I had explained it was my first time and I want to have nothing but the best. So, she recommended me a 3x3 burger animal style + fries animal style. I was not in the mood for a shake, so I just got a regular drink. The food did not take long to make and looked absolutely delectable. For the burger, it honestly looked like a heart attack with 3 patties, lots of cheese, onions, tomatoes and pickles, but it was all amazingly fresh and delicious. However, the sauce is what really stole the show for me. What makes it \"animal style\" is the addition of thousand island sauce and mustard grilled patties. All for a very reasonable price, because I was stuffed and felt that it the amount you get for the price was a great deal.  The only drawback, in my opinion, were the fries. To me, the fries were possibly over cooked,  dry, and broke apart too easily in my mouth. Even with the animal style sauce all over it, it just didn't hit that mark for me.   Overall, I would highly recommend this burger joint to anyone who just loves burgers/fries, that old school burger joint theme, at a great price."}
{"text":"I had never tried In&Out until recently.  I stopped by around noon and the place was packed.  The crowd was 95% spanish as was the staff, and it was pretty noisy, but the orders came out fast as numbers were being called.  My order came with tomatoes even though I specifically stated I did not want them, but I removed them and was happy with my order.  They were wrapped with about a 1/3 of the hamburger showing and done very neatly and placed in a small tray, along with my fries which were of adaquate size and very tasty.  I ate there again a couple of days later and my order came as I ordered it and they were again good and presented well.  The crowd was the same as this must be a favorite place frequented by the local spanish crowd.  I would recommend eating In&Out's Burgers and fries and say they are towards the top of the list of GOOD, inexpensive, Burgers & Fries."}
{"text":"I always look forward to In-N-Out burger. They have great prices and friendly service. This location was no different. In order to find somewhere to sit, you have to be a bit savage and run, not walk, to the vacated table!   I always get an animal style double double (no bun, lettuce instead) and animal style fries. This time, I tried them well done. Wow! Super crispy and of course the secret sauce and cheese on top made them that much better!   This chain is always consistent and use fresh, quality ingredients. They have a large secret menu, which is a lot of fun! I'm dying to try their Neapolitan shake which is a mix of vanilla, strawberry and chocolate. Their strawberry shakes, which I have tried are super thick and creamy!  Check out their secret menu online and come prepared to try something different as their posted, in store menu is just a small preview of what you can get here!"}
{"text":"Came here late at night, about 12:35am. I've always come here when I'm at desert ridge so I'm very familiar with this location. Service is always top notch, staff is friendly and food is always delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love in & out but today they kinda messed up my order. I'll give it another try next time and I hope they can get my order right."}
{"text":"when your east coast friend is visiting and tells you they're craving in n out, you have to find it in your heart to make it happen. i know, it's so hard, but someone has to do it.   what i ate: - protein style cheeseburger, animal style: after eating plenty of snacks in the VIP lounge at my hotel, i wasn't that hungry. my friend suggested i get it protein style. \"it's just a snack without the buns!\" well said, friend, well said; just reinforcing the reason why we are friends. it was my first time having it protein style and i do like it. it's much more refreshing, but i would miss the buns if i was hungry.  - fries well done: love getting my fries well done, more oil, but better texture  pros: - cheap! so afforadable - delicious! - this location was way less busy than the one further south on the 15. although my friends and i did go at 2 in the afternoon or so  cons: - a ten min drive from the strip. oh the horror  would i come again? sure"}
{"text":"Terrific customer service the food was good best hamburger in town very crowded but worth it. Every time we want to have hamburgers we go there because it's close by very good and I do recommend that place to anyone."}
{"text":"I usually have a general rule when eating in Vegas to not order anything that I would normally have back at home.  Well, it was around 9pm and I just happened to be walking nearby In-N-Out at the LINQ and so you know, when you crave something you love, you gotta have it!  I just ordered my usual two cheeseburgers Animal style without lettuce and tomatoes (http://bit.ly/2w4yKZl).  Just the way I like it and totally hit the spot for me.  I didn't order any fries only because I was craving the burgers at the time.  This location is pretty similar to the San Francisco location at Fisherman's Wharf.  There's no drive-thru, but a ton of tables both inside and outside.  Plus the prices are inflated since it's literally on the Strip, but still cheaper than Shake Shack, and even White Castle.    Overall, this In-N-Out location is a very welcome addition to the Strip and is another great late night burger option if you're in that area."}
{"text":"Animal Style Burger and Fries.  I go 4X4 because I have to travel 2,000 miles to eat here so I get my $ worth.    This particular location is busy, clean, and staffed by some very friendly people."}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out.  Number one protein style!   Great helpful staff, clean dining room, order is always right, yep winner winner burger dinner!"}
{"text":"Seriously? Can you even think of writing a bad review of In-N-Out?  I do love the burgers here. I order mine protein style (no bun) so flippin yummy!  This place is busy, and that is fantastic, I love to people watch and eat tasty burgers! Animal style fries, oh yes lord!"}
{"text":"Oh Come on! InNOut Burger, I love it. They always seem to get my order right even in the drive threw, I like to go in and wash my hands before I eat my #1 protein style burger. Pretty clean store considering they are right on top of the UNLV campus, Ahh College.. Great place to people watch, did I mention the college?"}
{"text":"Like every In and Out, the perfect meal perfectly prepared. And the people working there, as at all of them, super nice and friendly.  Always my first stop when I travel to a city that has them."}
{"text":"Ordered the double-double burger, which was delicious as always. This location was particularly busy, yet the service was still fast,  friendly,  and very  professional. Will definitely be back if in the  area."}
{"text":"The double -double  is as good as always. And so was the fries. The location is very popular today. The service was fast and friendly.  Would come back if in the area."}
{"text":"Double double is good as always. Location is pretty busy on Sundays.  Service is fast and friendly. Would come back again."}
{"text":"I come here often for lunch since it's near and I love it here, it does have long lines but that's just how  good this place is."}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out omgggg. I always come here when I'm in town. They don't have this on the East Coast! The burgers are good portions and fries are freshly cut right in the kitchen where you can see. Service is amazing, such hard workers. The menu is simple and the prices are good. Always crowded when I go. But I prefer the secret menu ;)"}
{"text":"My guilty pleasure whenever I'm in the Southwest, In N Out will always leave you satisfied (and maybe a little bit ashamed of yourself).   Animal-style for LIFE."}
{"text":"This location meets the level of service and taste expected of an In-N-Out. This store is EXTREMELY busy, but the staff turned out meals quickly and efficiently. The wait was  reasonable and the food was up to par. I would avoid this location during the Friday afternoon lunch rush."}
{"text":"I do believe that the burger in In-N-Out is the best one in the United States. I ordered the \"four by four\" buger before, it is really huge and I love it so much.  But the food always come slow... don't consider a \"fast-food\" at all!!!"}
{"text":"Hmm I cam here on a trip because a few people said it was amazing and i always thought of it as just ok.... I got the burger protein style and the fries animal style, but the location was a but small and it was packed when we went. So it was alright, i had better burgers and fries without the hassle."}
{"text":"You know the story of regional burger place In-N-Out. They never freeze their meat, so they're only located near their suppliers, which means that unless you're in California, Arizona, Nevada and even Utah, you can't get In-N-Out.  The secret menu I never figured out past asking for my burger \"animal style\", because I pretty much stopped at what I thought was awesome.  This particular franchise is located near a heavily trafficked shopping area north of Phoenix proper, and it is staffed by some very friendly and attentive people. It was clean, it was well kept, and the food was as I expected from my many visits to In-N-Out in California- tasty burger, fresh-cut and slightly greasy fries and cold beverages.  I like the burgers better at Five Guys, but In-N-Out has a charm and a superior level of service that makes it a pleasant place to dine. Someone actually hired the employees here for their customer service skills and not because they were the cheapest help they could find. That is a reason to patronize this location, right there.  Plenty of outdoor seating for the always excellent Valley weather and good for people watching, too."}
{"text":"Is \"California Cool\" a brand? I think so, and I think In-N-Out personifies it better than any store in the mall selling overpriced clothing in Euro sizes.  Fresh ingredients including never frozen beef, and fries that are made after you order them. Pretty cheap pricing. Friendly service. Spotlessly clean. A secret menu adding intrigue to the ordinary.  So, what happens if you ask for your burger Gangnam Style?"}
{"text":"Loved it! This one guy made my day, Jose. Love you Jose! \"was good on that second order,\" he said and I couldn't stop laughing. Turned my day around!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! We dont have these in Florida. Very tasty and made to order. Fries are also very good and fresh made!"}
{"text":"I try my best to keep away from fast food and large chains...but this is one place I do visit now and again.  I get the single w/ cheese and animal style fries (sauce and sauted onions). In my younger days I would get the 4x4 animal style burger which is as gargantuan as it sounds.  I do believe the shakes are quite weak.....i do not waste my $ there.  All in all not a bad spot..but it is mostly out of nostalgia from my younger days I still come here lol."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep doing it to myself every time I come to the west coast I stop at in n out and kick myself afterwards.  I guess I'm always thinking my bad experience is just a fluke especially when folks from the west coast rave about this burger joint, I keep hoping to experience this goodness they obvious experience. Well I don't and I perhaps never will this food is mediocre at best the fries aren't good cute concept with the lap mat but honestly I'd take Burger King over In-N-out hell shake shack is way better.  West coast Shenanigans I tell ya....."}
{"text":"The quality of the meat might be better than in other places - but my cheeseburger had almost no burger! Very disappointing. A ton of lettuce and tomato but a very thin burger that was not even the full size of the bun."}
{"text":"Classic west coast fast food that feels much more fresh than the likes of Mcdonalds, Burger King, etc. But- what really made the experience great for me was Lee. A very kind young man who worked the floor and helped all customers with their orders. He even gifted me and my two friends in & out stickers and hats. Made my day!"}
{"text":"Last night we had a healthy dinner at Paleo Brio Healthy Kitchen Restaurant of n Sedona, AZ. Ahh enough of the health food time for the time being, time for an In N Out burger.    At every In N Out Burger I have ever eaten at there is a line at the drive through and a long line inside the restaurant no matter what time of the day you are at the restaurant.  This one was no exception to the rule.  In & Out provided a very good burger especially for the price.  I mean $3.70 for a double double with grilled onions, tomatoes & cheese, you can't beat the price for the quality   I mean you can get better burgers, but for the price and quality In N Out is tough to beat.  Compared to the competitors in the same price range In N Out and one of the best price and quality burgers that's why there is always a line no matter when you come here.  The lines are always long, but fear not they have a system and process through people very quickly."}
{"text":"Someone asked me the other day why I liked In-N-Out burgers.  It is about the pure perfect burger made from fresh never frozen ingredients made fresh to order. There is not all the extra fluff and things added to the meat. It is the simple pleasure of eating a fresh just prepared burger   I like mine animal style to get that wonderful grilled onions, pickles along with the tomatoes and lettuce. The special sauce is a must. I get it with out salt.  The French fries is also simple perfection. It is made from pure fresh potatoes. It is actually fun watching the staff push whole potatoes through the cutter. I like this also without salt. It comes out piping hot and is perfection with ketchup. It is also very reasonable.  I love getting a great meal for less than $10.  The restroom is also reasonably clean.   Why do I like In-N-Out you ask?  It is simple perfection."}
{"text":"Meh. The hype was great until you come and taste it for yourself. It's nothing special, or different, I was just hoping for good, didn't get that."}
{"text":"Cheap food, about ~$6-8 for a meal that will get you a double cheeseburger and a generous portion of fries, as well as a drink. Food tasted great!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with a double double from In-N-Out. I like this location, always clean and always good food. Perfect for when you want a good fresh hamburger at a really good price!"}
{"text":"Always good. They nailed my first visit to this location...Stopped in to get Girls some burger's and fries. My girls like it pretty plain but service was great. and My girls got exactly what they wanted and enjoyed the meal in a nice clean and fresh fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"After hearing all the raving reviews I had to try it out.  I have to say that although the prices were cheaper than comparable fast food burger places, the overall burger was nothing to rave about. I prever NY Shack burgers anytime.  I am really not sure if people like it because one cannot find it on the East Coast or what exactly brought the popularity of these burgers because for me it was inferior in taste even to McDonalds (and I am talking purely on taste, no doubt anything is better quality than McDonalds)."}
{"text":"You can expect your burger like any other In-N-Out Burger. The staff are friendly (as expected) and are always willing to help clean up after you're done. The restaurant and bathroom are clean and some of the outside seating is covered.  If you're looking for a quick lunch, don't expect to get in/out of this place in less than 20 minutes after ordering. During lunch/dinner hours, the drive-thru creates a line of cars that do their best to wind themselves throughout the parking lot while people are trying to get in/out of their parking spots. There are also times during lunch when the line inside the restaurant squeezes out the front door which can be a little bit of a pain on some of the hotter Las Vegas days.  Overall, I love In-N-Out Burger and I'll wait just about any amount of time to get my double-double, animal style with animal style fries!"}
{"text":"Great customer service,  they work like a polite machine!  A small wait due to the spot being so busy but its worth it.  Fresh burgers and fries and a side of pickles.  Basic never tasted so good."}
{"text":"I'm going to generalize here, but all In-N-Out Burgers are pretty much the same, with the exception of wait times, the food is pretty standardized across the board. It's not my favorite burger out there, but it's good. The fries are fresh but my tastes lean more towards crispy fries, these are always on the limp side. That being said, this particular location was expeditious in getting our food and we were satisfied with the meal."}
{"text":"Always an awesome place if you're looking for a good burger. Get the 2x2 animal style and get well done fries."}
{"text":"This was the first time I have ever been to a(n) in and out. Fast friendly service. Reasonable prices. Best burger I have gotten from a non mom and pop shop.  This in and out is by the fiesta mall, more off of alma school than southern.  Not a long wait in the drive thru either.. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome burger today! Ordered the double double, ... The veggies were cold and fresh, the burger was done to perfection, the bun was perfectly toasted! And as always a super friendly staff. I will always give in and out two thumbs up. Much better than any other burger rival! These places need to speak like wildfire! Rather eat there than any other fast food joint!"}
{"text":"Average food, totally overpriced for what you got, not enough options for diet sodas. Might visit again in the future for a second try."}
{"text":"So this is of course the other establishment that must be visited on a trip back home. I tried the grilled cheese for the first time today, and it was just as good as any burger. It's basically everything except the meat with extra cheese. Ask for extra tomatoes too, and it'll be grand. But of course there's nothing like a hamburger animal style or a good old cheeseburger with grilled onions. Yum. =]"}
{"text":"Ok, so the food would probably get three stars, but for my first time to this chain, and at a very busy Vegas location, it was a really good experience.   Burger was good, but definitely more salty than I'm used to - I think it must have been a fluke because surely their burgers aren't always this salty. I was hoping for leaf lettuce, but it was more like chunks of iceberg - just personal preference. The tomato was fresh and I liked the sauce, which is basically thousand island dressing. I ordered cheese fries but that was a mistake as I was expecting a cheese sauce but they a steam a slice of American cheese on top of the fries...had I known that I would  not have ordered cheese fries, haha, but again that's just personal preference.   It's quick and convenient, free refills on drinks, and for under $20 for two I was really pleased. Happy that I finally got to try it out."}
{"text":"In-N-Out really compliments their name 110%. The work station was straight up hustlin from the cashiers, to the cooks, to the person that calls out everybody's order (keep in mind it's usually only one person... and they are very efficient). Super fast coming in and out of this place, just like how I felt my vacation trip to Vegas was...  Anyways, the burgers aren't bad. I mean what do you expect from a fast food restaurant? To find something as cheap and good as this on the strip is definitely a win-win. Single burgers are a little under 4$, while doubles are a little under 5$.  There is also a secret option that is not so secret anymore. I heard a lot of people mention \"animal style\" which is some special sauce with fried onions and cheese. You're able to add this with your burger or your fries. To be honest, I didn't think that it was all that. I was thinking gains... try it tho before you stick to the yummy basic order menu"}
{"text":"Last night I was in here trying to order well after having to REPEAT my order to the cashier 5 times the order was place. Only to find out when I got home EVERYTHING WAS WRONG and there was a HAIR IN MY FOOD!!!! I called the 1-800 number and was told to go back and they would give me my order again FRESH and without HAIR. Upon my arrival not only was the manager extremely rude, she tried to refuse to give me the food even after they called her ahead of time telling her I was coming back! After arguing with her for way too long she agreed to give me the food but not the entire order. THEN she proceeded to have every single person in line be waited on before giving me my food. And the cherry on top. THE FOOD WAS COLD!!!!!! I cannot believe the outright disrespect these people had towards me. I didn't mess up my order and put hair on it YOU DID!!!!! I will NOT be coming back to this location!! The staff needs some serious training!!!"}
{"text":"As a Las Vegas resident, I can understand the attraction of tourists to want to experience what they may not have in their location...it is beyond me, however, how the In-N-Out chain has so successfully milked a \"mystic\" for their chain, that would constantly bring hordes to this and their other locations. Personally, I don't find the burgers or fries here as extraordinary or even special; Shake Shack, Fatburger, and a zillion other places in Vegas, deliver a better product.  Everytime I drive by here, and see the parking lot jammed, I find myself at a total loss of understanding, or an appreciation of someone's successful merchandising.  This place does not \"deserve\" the patronage it gets..."}
{"text":"Ummm, so I can't eat meat.  Unfortunate, yes I know.  All I can say is there must be some damn good hamburgers here, the line was crazy!  I did eat french fries, which were delicious.  Fresh cut right in the kitchen, I saw them prepping the potatoes with my own eyes.  Good service, good food, and clean surroundings :)"}
{"text":"Family of 5 in Vegas for the week. We are from the Midwest and have never been to an In and Out so we knew we had to put this on the list of things to do.  Super surprised of the simple menu. Easy for mom to order for all since I didn't have to ask what they wanted.  Everyone got fries so we had way too many however at the end of the meal I see not a single fry left.  Very good burgers, the sauce was familiar but overall a very good burger.  Would try again next time, with they would bring them here."}
{"text":"A drunken trip to Vegas means nothing unless you stop at In and Out.  In and Out if you are reading this, I know of over 50 people in NJ that would do anything for you to bring your business within the Tri-state area.  Please consider.  This is fast food done right.  Its almost a cult thing and you find yourself addicted to stopping there whenever in California or Nevada.  Please I beg you please come to NYC or NJ!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good like you'd expect from In-N-Out.  The staff at this location is incompetent usually forgetting to put napkins or forks with the order."}
{"text":"First time going to in and out being from the east coast. This hit the spot. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"This location has a great vibe and great customer service. The staff works fast and hard. They keep the store clean and are very friendly. The food is fresh and tastes just right. This is one of my favorite In-N-Out locations. Due to service and quality received. As with most locations the food is made to order; however, this store does a great job to make it taste a bit better. I've always seen them busy with customers, yet they don't fall behind on cleaning tables to sit at. Great job to those who work her and the teams who provided such great training and motivation, it shows."}
{"text":"Everybody knows In N Out so I don't really need to say much. This is my go-to place for yummy fresh burgers when I'm too lazy to cook. Their burger sauce is to die for and the meat always tastes fresh. The only downside is it's always packed. You'd be lucky to find a seat inside and the line of cars for the drive thru is always loooooong. Lol"}
{"text":"WE tried the recently opened In and out burger on the vegas strip,the place was packed,the food was prepared very fast,they have a limited menu,we choose the double cheesburgers,they were really,really good,the price for being on the strip was reasonable,the had both inside and outside seating,we almost could not find any seating,thats how many people were there,great food!!"}
{"text":"So unassuming BUT a freshness in the flavor that stays with you. Simple burger, even the thousand island is good and I don't like that dressing nor any dressing on my burgers. But this place just knows how to do burgers. So yummy. Wish I could have one right now."}
{"text":"First time at In-N-Out Burger and service, food, cleanliness of the store was excellent! I was there during a very busy time of the day but you wouldn't know it because of how fast I received my food. Group of staff really worked like a team to get customers orders \"in-n-out\" quickly."}
{"text":"Of course, delicious. This one is a lot bigger than the one I normally go to, but its service never wanes. I'm still on the fence about the fries in general at In-N-Out. They always seem raw? Sometimes I like to be a superglutton and get cheese fries. Definitely something to try out."}
{"text":"When I was in college, I used to see if I could eat my entire Wendy's value meal while driving back to my campus. (I went to college in Minneapolis' suburbia, which is basically corn fields, don't judge.) Anyway, I would race myself to see if I could stuff myself with my entire value meal, fries in the bottom of the bag, before I returned to the Theater building. (If you must know, I won. I won Every. Damn. Time.)   I caught myself unintentionally returning to this game the other day when I was at In-N-Out. I freebased that burger. The parameters of the game have had to change--many more stoplights and a longer distance from my fast food challenger and my home made this an easy win. There's something about In-N-Out that puts all other fast food burgers in a sad, shamed hell from which they'll never redeem themselves.  I also really like the company's policies--those workers are happy because they get treated well by their employer. Love you, Burger makers. Love you, secret menu. Love you, cheesy fries. Love you, In-N-Out. Forevs."}
{"text":"What's better than grabbing a burger from In-N-Out.  Getting one right on the strip.   Last time I was in Vegas this location wasn't open and I had to uber over to the nearest one.    So glad that this location opened within stumbling distance from my hotel.  Just have to play frogger to get there.   Same great taste and quality as all of them. Place was packed but we got our order very fast."}
{"text":"Although it is always busy when i come here, it is totally worth it. Never gotten an order wrong. My usual is a cheeseburger with spread only and a vanilla shake, the cheeseburger being cooked to perfection and the shake being thick and sweet. Very good place for lunch."}
{"text":"Another great place Seattle should have one of!!! They keep it simple and it works!!! Great Burgers and Fried for a very low price."}
{"text":"Worth the wait, we love in and it, always get the animal style fries and I looove the protein style burger when I'm not feeling the bread that day! Always friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"This is my local In-n-out, I come here usually at least once a every two weeks for the last year if not more. You can definitely put this place in my top 3 foods. The burgers are delicious cooked made fresh to your order. I usually get chopped chilies no onions for that extra zing on the burger. Top with a shake. The customer service here is always amazing, never have I experienced a rude employee or even irritated looks. Management seems to really care about customer service and kudos for that!! This location usually stays busy in the drive through so expect a wait but if your a normal in-n-out enthusiast or fan you would already know there is a wait. I give this place 5 stars for being one of my favorite locations and burger joints. Enjoy..."}
{"text":"I drove compeltely out of my way for an In-N-Out burger last night.  I freakin love that place.  I have to say, I have been eating at In-N-Out since I was a teen in LA.  It will always be my favorite.  I want to tell you that the 20 years ( God I am getting old) that I have been eating at In-N-Out I have never tried animal style.  I never wanted to screw up what I thought was the best.  I ordered animal style for the first time.  I seriously am in love.  I kind of feel like I wasted the last 20 years of In-N-Out eating on plain old cheeseburgers, when I could of had ANIMAL style! What was I thinking LOL.  If you have never tried Animal style, jump out the box and do it!  it is worth it!"}
{"text":"I've heard lots and lots about In-N-Out! So when we finally made it out to the west coast, I told my husband that I was not leaving until I had had an In-N-Out burger. And let me tell you, they are worth all that fuss. I was a little shocked at the limited menu they have, but it didn't affect me in any way. I knew I was going to get the Double-Double Animal Style thanks to all the reviews I'd read. It was hot, and cheesy, and amazing. My husband had a hamburger, and it was really tasty and flavorful too, much to my surprise. Why are they not a country-wide chain yet? Come on In-N-Out, get to Michigan quicker!!"}
{"text":"Love this In & Out location, the cashiers and kitchen are extremely fast and my food always tastes excellent.  Never been a big fan of their fries, but love the cheeseburgers and milkshakes!"}
{"text":"It is the best bang for your buck in town! I love the double double animal style which is grilled onions! I'm not to fond of their shakes because they aren't more milky than I prefer but I have been coming here for years and give it a 5 out of 5!"}
{"text":"Being originally from Southern Cali, you can never go wrong with a in-n-out burger! Double double no tomato, extra whole grilled onions with my fries well down is how I get down! You can smell the grilled onions from down the block. Defiantly reminds me of home!"}
{"text":"I just recently moved to Arizona from Illinois and my husband and I were looking for a good burger joint. All i can say is WOW. It is affordable and Great burgers and fries. The customer service is top notch here. The drive thru is so long every time we visit but it moves very fast!"}
{"text":"Went to this joint about 2-3 years ago and I was not impressed. I did all my research and went for the secret menu and ordered the burger and fries \"Animal style\". They just dumped thousand island dressing on it with bacon and cheese. It was nothing special and it was just full of grease. I heard the ones in San Fran were a lot better. I hope so...because I really didn't understand the hype of this place.."}
{"text":"I love this place and have left other good reviews for various other In N Outs. And although everything was as expected at this particular one, there is a trend that happens at the Drive Thru window that is a little bothersome hence the four stars.   Everyone knows how good this place can be...but imagine if they had bacon!!!!  Anywho...I now live back in Phoenix and work about a mile away from this particular location. My first time there (I went for lunch) I waited in line as usual but when I got to the window where they deliver the food, I was greeted by a girl who wasn't as chipper as most of the other employees that I have come in contact with. No worries.   When I was asked if I would like ketchup, I responded with my usual, \"No thanks, but I would like some salt and pepper please.\"  Not a big deal.   While holding up one packet of salt she replied, \"Is one enough?\"  I sort of stalled for a second. Here was this girl, holding up one packet of salt and asking me if that was enough? Really? You guys throw away all those \"placemats\" for each driver which likely costs more than the packet o salt, but yet you're trying to control costs by rationing salt?  I told her that I would like a few of each. Next thing I know she grabs a handful and dumps them in my \"Eat in your car\" box.   It was one extreme to the other and totally unnecessary?! I left and let that situation go as an isolated incident.   Well, since I do love these burgers, I was back again, around the same time of day and guess who is rationing salt again? Same girl, same question, same response and another handful of salt...I don't get it. In all the years (10+) of going to In N Out, or as I like to call it, In N Wait, I have never been asked if I would like a single packet of anything...in fact, never in my life have I been asked that question at any establishment. Its absurd.   Needless to say, if I wasn't such a big fan of the franchise this would have been a 2-3 star experience because of the repeat offence. I have been to the same In N Out burger on several occasions now, but have only run into this girl twice. None of the other employees ask if I want a single packet of Salt..."}
{"text":"Great location, friendly staff, awesome burgers. Get it protein style like my little girl enjoys or go Muppets with animal style, either way you're going to love it. The place is always clean although the name is not always true to it's word, there'll be times when you wait, but it's always worth it. Plus it's affordable....how about adding bacon to the menu..oh man I just had an accident in my drawers..."}
{"text":"You west coast people have no idea what you have here. Being isolated in Indiana is horrible with these tasty delectable treats await just a few thousand miles away. Double double animal style with an extra toasted bun and cheese fries is my personal nirvana."}
{"text":"The team at this in and out burger really had it all together today. They were extremely busy,busier than I've ever seen them, and the entire team was working hard and fast. Food was hot and delivery time was as it normally is. No delays. People were smiling, cashiers were personable and overall great experience. Great job to the team and the manager for delivering service.  Got my food and back to work in plenty of time. Thanks."}
{"text":"The only burgers that come close to In-N-Out burgers are the ones my dad grills up :)   This is in the perfect location (near shopping & entertainment) EXCEPT for the fact that there is only 1 entrance off of 83rd Ave. There is no entrance off of Bell & the shopping mall it sits on is walled off, so you have to go around. If hunger calls though, driving around in a little circle isn't too bad, lol!"}
{"text":"I feel the same way about all In-N-Outs..... it's like a little piece of home comfort :)  This location gets an extra star because it's easily accessible & on my way home from work, lol. Easy access!"}
{"text":"When I am hungry & don't have time to stop to eat, I hope there is an In-N-Out Burger around! I can fully enjoy their burgers & fries to the fullest WHILE driving because there is no one around to hear me moaning approval with every bite.   BTW, don't worry about my admittal to driving and eating all at once, I am GREAT at multitasking :)"}
{"text":"Typical In-N-Out but a bit slower than others I've been to."}
{"text":"I've always heard about In-N-Out from friends who have visited the west coast (particularly California) and I was happy to find out that there was one in Las Vegas while I was there. My friends and I actually wanted to walk from our hotel (Monte Carlo) to the In-N-Out in the area when we first arrived in Vegas. We decided it wasn't a good idea and we'd make our venture there another day since we were already too hungry at the time. Well the next day, we took a cab from our hotel to In-N-Out which was basically less than a 5-minute ride. Our cab drive did warn us about this specific franchise because of the long lines but we decided we'd brave it. The line and wait wasn't too horrible and we got our food within 15 minutes. I ordered the double double and fries with a vanilla milkshake. It was pretty great. Next time I'll order 3x3 and the fries with cheese (I know animal style is probably best but I'm not a fan of all the stuff they put in it unfortunately). I was also expecting them to charge a hefty price but it was a cheap and good meal. Definitely gotta try it when you're in the west coast and close to one. But for some reason I'm more partial to Shake Shack in NYC even though it's so much more expensive but it could just be because I can't completely compare the two side by side or that i'm biased to the east coast. I'll definitely come back and have some of these burgers again if I'm in the west coast."}
{"text":"When I'm on the west coast I always try to get in and out at least once, and this is my in and out of choice in greater Phoenix. The service is always quick and they don't mess up my order; that's about it I mean what else can I say it's an in and out and their food is always delicious. I swear it's like the crack of fast food, gotta get my fix of an animal style double double and animal style French fries."}
{"text":"Burger heaven!  OK Yelp team... you might as well toss this review in the \"not recommended\" pile, as this is going to be as biased as it gets.  I used to frequent In-N-Out for 5 years in SoCal... it has been over 5 years since my move to back to the east coast.  Currently, on business travel in Phoenix and first chance I get I hire a CAB to come here... Desperate?  Dedicated?  you decide.. either way.. In-N-Out does not disappoint.  I order my usual off menu order of Neopolitan shake, animal style cheese burger and regular cheese burger with onion.  Oh not to forget the animal style fries...  My dear cabbie waited outside as I feasted...  All he could say was that \"he understood\"..  Just like old times, the delicious flavors meld together in what has got to be one of the finest cheese burger experiences ever."}
{"text":"Ok everyone born on the west coast, Yes in-N-out is good. I don't think it's the best. The fries are ok, unless you get them animal style, you won't be disappointed. The burgers are good, as well as the shakes. Wish they had more variety. The way it was described to me by all Cali natives, it was mind blowing. Not as good as the hype, but definitely on point..."}
{"text":"In n out always get 5 stars for food in my book. I've gone to this location a couple times now and they are always friendly, attentive, and efficient. I normally have a complicated order and they haven't messed it up yet! When I've eaten inside it was very clean, especially for a busy Sunday. Great job in n out, keep it up."}
{"text":"Excellent service, yummy french fries that we always get two of them, burgers are deliciously full of stuff and greasy yummy, ya know the way a real burger should be. The only downside to the burgers were they were too small, more of a tease to me, an hour later you are hungry again. Always appreciate the great service and food though, we'll be back when we're not too hungry."}
{"text":"Just got home from here and tonight I am not sure exactly what happened in store.  I ordered animal fries and the newly promoted hot cocoa which seemed to be fine at the cashier and paid with no problem.  You know you have to wait especially at night with the drive thru out to the street and inside being just as crowded.  They call for animal fries only and I go up to the counter and ask is this mine and for the hot cocoa.  Girl tells me no,  not yours and I go back and wait patiently and then about 5 minutes later with the wife waiting in the car,  they finally motion me over apologizing that it actually was my order even though two people had been calling it multiple times.  There have been issues here before but this just seemed like what the hell dude?"}
{"text":"I come here about once a month from a long night at work, can never go wrong with animal style burger and fries...before bed. Service is always great."}
{"text":"Delicious! Simple is better...who would've thunk!  Love these burgers."}
{"text":"AHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!  That should be it. You need not know any more. Just go!!!!  Ok ok, I'll write a bit more. This In-N-Out, located directly across I-15 from New York New York on Tropicana, is just like most other In-N-Outs. The food is extremely fresh (considering it's fast food), the staff are friendly and efficient, and the atmosphere is that of happy Vegas trippers who haven't had In-N-Out in a while (or ever!).  It's definitely a doable walk from the strip (specifically from Tropicana and Las Vegas Blvd), but we did it in a car. Hey, you could probably do with a walk back after devouring a double-double!   Don't miss the little building to the left of the location. It's an In-N-Out merchandise store! Who knew! They have TONS of branded product. Anything from flip flops to coffee mugs! A little on the pricey side, but hey this is Vegas..."}
{"text":"So far the best In 'N' Out me and my wife have ever been too. Service was fast and the staff is caring and friendly. A big thing for us is the fries and these have been hot and fresh no matter what time we stop in."}
{"text":"What can you say about a fresh double double. I personally would rather have a double double than a lot of other burger joints because they are the standard of how a burger should be made. Living in California we have been blessed by having this restaurant by our house for years and will continue to visit them on a regular basis for their delicious burgers."}
{"text":"I've been an In-N-Out Burger fan for over 20 yrs.  Since my first bite into an In-N-Out Burger at their Camarillo location when I was in High School, I've been hooked.  Now that I'm well into my 30's, my visits to In-N-Out have dwindled to only a few times a year.....I can't seem to burn the calories like I use to, so visiting one is a huge treat for me.  Last night was one of those nights.  I ordered a Double Double & a Cheeseburger & Fries.  Of course, they came out prepared just like I remember them.....Sloppy, Drippy, and Nom-ilicous!  I am talking about the Burgers....ok?  The Fries are my fav's too.....you can always tell that they were just cut moments before I walked into the door.  I love it!  This location is the closest to my house, but for some reason I've never eaten here.  The drive thru was a madhouse of course, but there was no line inside....bonus!  I love watching them prepare the food as I wait....It amazes me that they can crank out so many burgers and fries so efficiently and consistently.....one of the major reasons why I come back.  Will I return?  That's a stupid question.....of course!"}
{"text":"Attended the Coffee Crisp UYE here hosted by Jennifer C & Elle C.  I brought my Son along to enjoy the grub and Yelp fun.  We were first to arrive and since it was packed, we ordered before everyone.  We ordered:  2 Double Doubles Animal Style ($3.05) 1 Cheeseburger Animal Style ($2.05) 2 French Fries Animal Style ($3.25)  We brought our own bottled Water.  After a 15 minute wait, our food was ready.....it was already 1 pm and we didn't see any other Yelpers, so we started to eat our food.  The Double Double Animal Style was juicy & sloppy....just how I like it!  (see pics)  There's something about the spongy, toasted Bread, gooey Cheese, fresh Tomato & Lettuce, Special Sauce, and Grilled Onions that makes me want to never stop eating this stuff.  The Animal Style Fries were fantastic as well.  About 1/2 way through our meal, I spotted Paolo D & Jennifer C at the door waiting for everyone.  I went over to introduce myself and let them know that we had room at our table and that we'd also keep an eye out for nearby tables to open up so we could all sit together.  We were eventually able to get everyone together.  We all enjoyed a nice meal plus we shared in some Coffee Crisps & Caramilk Bars for dessert courtesy of Elle C from Calgary! (see pics)  What a great day & meal.  Great Food & Great People = Good Times  Will I return?  This location is very far away from where I live, but if there's another UYE here, I will try my best to make it."}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out, but this is the first time I've got to give them only 3 Stars.  I recently came to this location and ordered:  Cheeseburger Animal Style, $2.25 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n-out-burger-tempe?select=K7mA8k4ZMqZ0ga-DN0-wdQ#K7mA8k4ZMqZ0ga-DN0-wdQ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n-out-burger-tempe?select=EUJfvJBibUcaWvjeggno5w#EUJfvJBibUcaWvjeggno5w  French Fries Animal Style, $3.50 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n-out-burger-tempe?select=MocfGFJGvCqJYX4_rR_7VQ#MocfGFJGvCqJYX4_rR_7VQ  Small Soda, $1.40  The Cheeseburger was perfect....had all of the flavor that I've come to love about In-N-Out.  The Animal Fries on the other hand were terrible....they were cold and chewy.  Unbelievable, because they cook it fresh....they must've left this order on the counter while they finished by Burger instead of giving me a fresh order of Animal Fries.  It was a little disappointing because I normally have a 4 or 5 Star experience at an In-N-Out.  Oh well, maybe I caught them on a bad day?    Return Factor - 60%"}
{"text":"I just love having a Double Double and a Strawberry Shake! This is my \"Go to\" spot for a GREAT burger!"}
{"text":"Food is always good at In-n-out. Service is also always good but today was exceptional! The employees were even friendlier, they brought our food while we were seated outside & another employee even came & got my husband his soda refill. They just went above & beyond. We love our neighborhood sin-N-Out!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of In-N-Out and this location delivers the goods.  I order my usual Double Double ($3.20) w/Animal Style Fries ($3.40). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n-out-burger-scottsdale?select=pcv1WV4PX5DUax5tcTSZug#pcv1WV4PX5DUax5tcTSZug http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n-out-burger-scottsdale?select=h0r285bh09IY6jVDcNsYww#h0r285bh09IY6jVDcNsYww http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n-out-burger-scottsdale?select=WCcyB294517rhQmOfML9OA#WCcyB294517rhQmOfML9OA  In-N-Out never disappoints.  It always delivers a fresh, tasty Burger.  The sweet/tangy flavor of the Animal Style Sauce makes the Fries & Burgers even more addicting.  This location has great employees (they all do) and it's not as crazy busy as the locations in California & Vegas.  Return Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"For a fast food company this & Jack and the Box out every fast food company back home to shame. The burgers are tasty and just  on point. Very full of flavor. The staff in the drive thru was very friendly and helpful with it being our first time there. The chocolate shakes are fire. Worth a stop while out west."}
{"text":"Nothing but love. We went in ten minutes before closing, they welcomed us even though we only ordered fries and water.  Above and beyond: the amazing woman who was involved in the following event.  Her: is there anything else we can help you with? David: ...actually... my wife would like more peppers. Her: I got you (to me regarding my soggy paper tray of peppers) you can go ahead and toss those. ( I did, trustingly. She grabbed a bag and filled it to the top with packages of peppers) This way they won't go mush in your fridge.  Me: you don't even know, I wake up and snack on these. ( random guy looks at me like I'm crazy) Her:  I know. Enjoy.  As we left I fumbled for adequate words to reflect the quality of the environment which this staff maintains and our gratitude to be among their patrons. In reflection, I believe the best way to show our support is to continue to bring them our business."}
{"text":"oh in-n-out...how you'll always be the best burger in any competition with whatever east coast patty slinging, fast food dishing, french fry frying competition you face.  i'd happy take a double-double animal style with a side of fries and possibly a milkshake from you than any five guys concoction i can think up or even any artery clogging creation that spike mendelsohn can put in front of me or even a giant plate sized behemoth i can find at ray's.  i miss everything about you...the well oiled machine you have running.  i love that the entire operation is always in plain view to the customer...how you have a secret menu that only true lovers of in-n-out (and anyone who can search the internet) knows about...how all the employees have aprons with giant pins knotting it all together.  maybe it's just the fact that i don't get to indulge myself in the deliciousness of in-n-out anymore that my praise for thee has grown exponentially...but i don't care, i love you.  my in-n-out pangs rival if not surpass my 2 am pollo asada burrito pangs...and that's saying a lot about someone who has a pantheon of hunger pangs.  the in-n-out purist in me doesn't want to see you franchised out, but it would be nice if the family business decided to venture east and show these elitists what a real burger should taste like.  but until my next venture back the my roots on the western side of the country, double-double animal style with crisp fries and a vanilla shake, you will be in my dreams."}
{"text":"Ok, as a guy from the DC Metro area, I'm constantly told by friends who have been out west that In-N-Out is the best burger chain and a must-have should I find myself out here.  I had eaten a burger here in NorCal a few years ago and was unimpressed, but my palate wasn't as refined so I figured I'd give it another shot.  My dad, brother and I went at lunch time on a Friday. The line was long but orders were taken quickly and food was coming out constantly. It was truly impressive!  Now as for what I ordered: a #1 Double Double with everything (including onion), fries and a Coke. I picked up some of the \"Chiles\" too.  So the Chiles are just baby pepperoncini I guess, but they were tasty. The fries were weak. I know they're fresh but they're dry and crunchy, like canned Potato Sticks you can get in the store. The burger was tasty, and while I hate Big Mac sauce and thousand island dressing, I actually did like the In-N-Out sauce. I'd put the burger a notch above Wendy's but that's it. My brother got a vanilla shake and it tasted like someone blended up McDonald's ice cream cones, including the actual cake cone. Meh. It's also taken a few hours to dissolve the salt left in my throat from the food.  Five Guys destroys In-N-Out in every regard. The selection of toppings at Five Guys is astounding and their boardwalk style fries have NO EQUAL. Now, In-N-Out is good, and I'd give it a 3.5 if I could for the food. The 4 is earned by effort of the staff and execution. Not having bacon or other exotic toppings is a serious hash in the con box."}
{"text":"People from all walks of life come to this place.  It's the best place to people watch! I've been going to this location for about five years but always end up parking on the other side of the divider and never have I made it to the In-N-Out parking lot or drive thru. (Don't pull that Asian women driver crap on me- that's not how it goes down when I'm driving.) If you're heading north on 83rd - it's an easy turn to get into this location- but if you're heading west on Bell- forget it- park somewhere else and walk through the parking lot to get your grub on. You will only know what I'm talking about if you have been to this location.    I like mine animal style and with cheese! What's animal style? Animal style mean: pickles, extra spread, grilled onions, and mustard fried onto each meat patty.  On a bad day- I get it with everything but tomatoes.    This might not be a big secret but to make the fries extra yummy- put a lot of pepper on your ketchup. =)   This is truly American food for Americans. While waiting I saw children, adult, White, Black, Mexican, my people, Indian, Native American, single mother, folks from the Middle East, Northeast, Southwest...., neighbors from Sun City(are they allowed to eat fast food???)- this place has such a diverse collection of customers.  I never notice it until today when I had to sit and wait for my order. This place is amazing!!!   Back to the food- it's delish! Someday I might even do a 10x10---someday....for now, I'm training for it."}
{"text":"Good Fast Greasy Comfort Food. They do Burgers and Shakes and they do them well. Busy Busy Busy"}
{"text":"Busy lunch time crowd, but moving along through the drive thru. Don't mind waiting a little extra for a fresh burger and fries.  We have a newbie at the pay window, who handed me my change back with wet hands. Why are they wet? Should I be worried? Money handling and wet hands... No bueno. When I got to the window, he looked surprised to see me there, odd consider in it's lunch time with a line.   Now arrived at pick up window, and the girl is currently being trained. No worries, we all start somewhere, right?  I asked for my order to go, and I get it is handed me to eat in car. I took it as I did not want to hold up the line while they hurried to put it in a bag. Looks good as always.  My fry light was done right and burger animal style was good.  Disappointed on the lack of flow and service today, usually always nail it. Taking it down for the wet hands I can't quite get over.  Just tasted my coke, way too sweet and too much carbonation. You need to brix your machine stat. Not a winner today."}
{"text":"April 2017. The line is super long, but the staff is quick. You should try and snag a table as soon as you order if you plan on staying in. Simple menu so people usually know what they are ordering as soon as they make it to the cashier. We were able to find a table for the three of us not too long after we ordered. However, there are a lot of other customers searching as well, so you have to be quick. Our order took about 10-15 minutes because it was so busy. We were able to save our seats and drink our soda while we waited. We were out walking the Strip that day, so we didn't go for the Animal style like everyone suggested.  The burgers are good as well as the fries. I don't know if it's worth all of the hype, but against other fast food burgers- it is pretty good."}
{"text":"I love it!! One of the best fast food burgers!! My favorite is to get a regular cheese burger with grilled onions and animals style fries."}
{"text":"This location is so busy due to its proximity to the strip. Food is still good as ever. They get the burgers out fast and our fries looked like they were fresh from the fryer. Definitely a good spot for people watching."}
{"text":"Meat is MURDER!!!!!  Sweet tasty tasty murder, and no one knows how to prepare a grilled burger and make the tastiest fries around like In-N-Out Burger.  The drive-thru line can be long a lot of the times, and for good reason.  Of course, the thing that differentiates their long drive-thru lines is that they actually move rather quickly so I never mind waiting for all that grilled goodness.  The only thing that could make their burgers better is bacon but that's like saying the only thing that can make something wet is water.  Bacon or not, everyone should pay homage to In-N-Out burger =)"}
{"text":"I guess for fast food it's ok.  But it doesn't live up to the hype. The meat is definitely fresh, but the patties were kinda small and the double double's cheese to meat ratio was too high. I tasted more cheese than meat.     The fries were bland. McDonald's taste better. Strawberry shake doesn't hold up to chickfila.   If you want a fast, cheap burger it's a decent choice."}
{"text":"Service was amazing!!! Food of course was delicious and the restaurant was very clean. A must visit every time I go to the west coast."}
{"text":"Every location of In-n-Out Burger I've ever visited in AZ and CA has been the same: shockingly efficient, Stepford-like teenagers politely fulfilling my desires for meat and potatoes. The food is also always good. The burgers seem like they are actually made of meat instead of mystery fillers. The fries are crispy but not in an unnatural way.   Make sure you are aware of the not-so-secret menu. I usually get a burger protein-style, animal-style, with mustard instead of spread. They get it right every time. Just went there yesterday with out of town family guests and they love the place, too. It is a priority whenever they visit.   The location at Desert Ridge can get kind of busy, but they always get you through the drive-through line surprisingly quickly. I opt for drive-through when the place is busy, as it seems faster than when you order inside. Plus I am not a fan of smelling the ketchup-permeated air that fills the restaurant. Americans. We love our freaking ketchup."}
{"text":"The service that I receive whenever I come to In-N-Out is consistently great. From walking in and being welcomed, to being served at the counter and seating ourselves to eat, this company definitely has their priorities straight with regards to service and it makes all the difference! The food is also so tasty, although it's important to bare in mind that this is fast food and the food does fall in line with that in terms of quality. I always go for a cheeseburger (protein style). The lettuce is always fresh and crunchy which I love but the way it's put together (condiments etc) is sometimes better than other times. Also, if you are not aware of animal fries (fries with thousand island style dressing, cheese, onion and pickle), where have you been?! Seriously, every time! Come to think of it, I don't think I know that I've ever had the regular fries. I didn't realise until my visit yesterday that you can change how well done the fries are cooked and with the animal fries sauce, I always wanted the fries a little more crunchy so they wouldn't go soggy. In a word.. AMAZING!!! INO is always my go to fast food treat and I doubt that will ever change!"}
{"text":"There would be something seriously wrong with me if I made a trip out West for five days and did not visit an In N Out Burger.  While regional fast food favorites are becoming more nationwide, this one is nowhere near Florida and I don't expect it will magically appear anytime in the near future.  As I sat in the stadium watching the Chargers-Cardinals, I kept telling myself not to buy the overpriced concession fare and that hitting the In N Out drive-thru on the way back to the hotel after the game would be the best option.  While the wait was a bit longer than I expected, I made the right choice.   There's not only something very tasty about it, but it almost seems taboo for this Floridian to know and enjoy this on every trip to Phoenix, Las Vegas or Los Angeles.  Alexis was working the window on this busy night, was super sweet and got everything right with my order.  Cardinals fans may have been happy with the late rally to win the season opener, but I was just as pleased with my postgame meal before leaving the next morning to head back home."}
{"text":"always delicious!!! Wish there were more choices however love their food and always get spread!! makes the french fries so much better!!"}
{"text":"delicious food for a great price. would rather go and get in n out then other fast food places. its a bit far from us then other fast food places so its usually not an option but we love in n out burger! the food is always fresh and tastes amazing. make sure to ask for spread for the french fried. its delicious!! also the lemonade is amazing! this place is usually packed during lunch since its located near desert ridge mall but its worth the wait when you want a fresh burger and fries."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I'm a picky eater. I don't like tomato, onions, or pickles on my burger. In the past 6 months I've been to this location 3 times, and every time they screw something up. I usually just take off whatever they left on and call it a day though. Want your fries well done? Probably not going to happen. Personally, I would suck up the Uber ride and head across the highway to the other In-N-Out where they'll actually get your order right. If you don't have any modifications and just want a burger, I'm sure it'll be fine. Oh and don't let the line fool you, they bust out orders fairly quickly!"}
{"text":"Love in n out. This location is consistent with all others. Hits the spot when I get a craving for a burger. This location is ALWAYS very busy, usually 10-15 min from walk in to having food."}
{"text":"It is an American icon and the staff at this location has always been super friendly."}
{"text":"A trip to Vegas isn't complete without a trip to In-N-Out. We took a cab from the hotel to get a burger first before heading to the airport. I would suggest getting your fries animal style, but I didn't this trip.  A double double with some fries was plenty enough for me. I don't understand why they won't build one in Denver. So for now, I have to get it when I can. Love you In-N-Out!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. All in and outs have treated me well but this place takes the cake for service. We always get our food blazing fast with no fuss and even with huge lines, they make sure you're out in ten minutes or less.  It truly is awesome. They are always on point with their orders and they never skimp out on the extra veggies when asked. Take a pit stop here and enjoy the burgers."}
{"text":"Visited while in Vegas. Daughter had checked out website and all the marketing and was eager to try as we do not have these in Florida. We were all disappointed. Average fast food burger, awful fries and shakes so thick you couldn't use a straw."}
{"text":"I am forever impressed when I first walk into any In-N-Out. The complete undeviating white and overall look of cleanliness is not lost on me. I've never seen an employee with a huge grease stain on their shirt or apron. All of them look super crisp and freshly pressed, shirts tucked in, black belts, girls with an oversized safety pin holding their apron closed. I couldn't tell you if any of the female employees there have long hair or not since they all have it neatly tucked into their caps. Ah. . . . I love walking into a clean looking place. I realize that a company that goes to those lengths to make sure of their employees appearance, must also be keen on quality.  I gladly ordered my double-double, fries and a coke. (yes, I can actually finish a double- double here. -blushing) You can taste the quality at first bite. Everything tastes fresh and natural. Delicious. No soggy, faded lettuce or frail tomatoes, just fresh, crunchy vegetables. Yummmm . . . then the fries . . . . those little golden sticks of heaven. They feel so airy light but tasty at the same time. My goodness. Just thinking about my meal makes me want to go again. I know I will. Soon."}
{"text":"For the price of these burgers, holy cow they're good! Still fast food, but \"healthier\" as in more fresh.   Make sure you add the sauces, and don't forget the fries! You won't regret, just make sure you're willing to wait because the line is always long :)"}
{"text":"Great food, fast service, very friendly. The only thing I hate is the way there drive thru is set up... Is very difficult to drive thru there when you have a big truck...I feel like I'm going to hit the something..."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said about In-N-Out Burger? Probably nothing.  I ate here knowing it was going to be my last gluten and dairy inclusive meal for a very long time, so I totally splurged, ordering a burger animal style (minus the cheese), fries, and a strawberry milkshake.  The burger was awesome.  You can get it protein style, wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun, and that's probably what I'll get the next time I'm in town.  The fried onions and the special sauce, as well as the obvious freshness of all the ingredients, proved In-N-Out to be worth the hype and well above Five Guys.  The strawberry milkshake was grand.  The fries were eh.  I'm told they are usually made to order, but I am pretty sure I didn't get a fresh batch.  They were good in that they weren't too salty, but they could have been hotter and crisper, for sure.    In short, animal style, animal style, animal style.  I see now why people are obsessed with this place.  I can't think of a better hangover cure."}
{"text":"You know when everyone seems to love something, but then you experience it for yourself and it's very anticlimactic? Well, that's how I feel about this joint. I just don't get it. It's so average, nothing special. Still people rave like they're having an orgasm.  I'm sure this will sound like am an elitist, but I guess if your only options were Burger King, Wendy's, or McDonalds this place might deserve 3 stars."}
{"text":"I've always heard that In-N-Out Burger is supposed to be so amazing. If this is amazing, I don't want to know what's bad! I tried the cheeseburger and fries and everything about them left something to be desired. The burger consisted of mainly lettuce...which I would've enjoyed had their been any meat on it. The fries were also bland. I've made a better burger at home...but then again I'm from Texas and burgers don't taste or look like that here.   I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"it is In-N-Out Burger, guys. The best damn burgers there are. do not expect a large menu. THEY DO BURGERS. As often as I go, over all of the miles over all of the years, I think I got burned once and that was even minor. The best place"}
{"text":"spotlessly clean and staffed by suspicously polite teenagers. where are we? stepford? it was my first in-n-out experience, and this is by far the jazziest location i have been.   it tasted pretty good too."}
{"text":"I wanna give this place 3 1/2 stars but will stick with three. The burgers are great but I was surprised how much I did not like the fries. I love most all fries and these were edible but to me they tasted like they were freeze dried. They were very underwhelming to me. My shake was average to good and they prices here were reasonable. This is a place I would visit again if I lived or stayed near one but wouldn't drive out of my way to try it again."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed in an in-n-out.  Ordered my animal style burger (accidentally calling it doggy-style-burger) and fries.  If I lived next to an in-n-out, everyday would be a cheat-day."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is just the best. Double-double animal style. Enough said"}
{"text":"This in-n-out burger was one of the best I've been to. Everything was great. The burger was cooked well and the fries were hot and had the right amount of salt. I would not recommend going there."}
{"text":"The best IN-N-OUT I have ever been too! They are always so nice and wonderful for having never ending lines all day long. At the other IN-N-OUT in town the boy tossed my food at me and I heard him say I gotta get outta here, these people are too much.   Well then, this one has never failed me, and I do not think they will! Only docked a star because the location has gotten really bad lately."}
{"text":"I've been to In n Out about a million times here in AZ and CA and I've never had a bad experience. The food is always good and out fast. They are always busy and deal with the crowds in stride. Very methodical and organized. The service here is always amazing. They smile, they are warm and friendly and I honestly appreciate that. Great company. Consistently good food and amazing employees. Well done."}
{"text":"I've literally never had a bad, nay, even mediocre experience here. Food is fresh, hot, out fast and so tasty. Service is perfect. Great value. My fav is #2 cheeseburger, protein style, ketchup and mustard instead of spread, and grilled onions :)"}
{"text":"The food is very good but they never have enough help at this location. The lines are always too long and the staff is often not aware of the need to speak up and clean up. Typical In and Out food."}
{"text":"Love in n out! Kirstyn working the register was very outgoing, happy and genuine!! I listened to her speak with each customer after me and she just sounded so happy! Made me smile :)"}
{"text":"excellent customer service, super quick drive through, always satisfied with the food!!"}
{"text":"Once upon a time I was a die hard, never failed beef jockey for Five Guys. Loved my meaty, cheesy, greasy goodness with all of those toppings and fantastic fries and peanuts and and and... You get the idea.   But then I moved west and started boarding my horses at Papago Stables on Tempe Town Lake (bad idea, the Papago part, not the move) and continuously caught whiff after spectacular whiff of the burger joint across Rural/Scottsdale Rd -- and then my husband fessed up and told me he'd been cheating me of In-N-Out simply by lying through omission of it's magical and mystical beefy properties of heart attack invoking goodness!  Double-Double? Onions? ANIMAL STYLE?! What sorcery is this?! And that SAUCE!!!! I would trade every Five Guys in the world for yet another spectacular nom-hour with In-N-Out's Double-Double.   And let's not start in on their strawberry shake... To die for. Holy strawberry explosion in my mouth!   Steak And Shake should be extremely worried about this franchise should they decide to invade eastward.   So much bang for your buck... In your mouth... Sideways... These guys are Burger Porn Stars, and I'm totally hooked"}
{"text":"I lived in Las Vegas for three years and my favorite part of living there was In-N-Out, it is the thing I miss the most. Best burger ever, hands down, not contest. Try the burger or fries as animal style you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, excellent food and service, and the staff is definitely the A-Team. The dining area was immaculate, and there was always someone making the rounds keeping the tables and floors clean. This is the kind of fast food template that McBrand-X needs to emulate. They just have a few things on their menu and they do it well, no salads, yogurt, or fruit cups posing as a \"healthy\" alternative; just good, simple burgers made on the spot, and this is what puts them head-n-shoulders above their competitors."}
{"text":"Still a good place for a Burger but Five Guys Burger & Fries has stolen me away."}
{"text":"best double double in town, it's fast food but it's not fast.  they take their time, everything is made fresh which I love.  The drive thru in hollywood takes forever though, I just park and go inside, it's much faster."}
{"text":"We went here for our first night in town thinking the simple menu would mean better quality and the kids would like it. I was very disappointed with the size of the burger. We could barely find it with everything else on it. I actually believe the slice of onion was bigger than the burger itself.  The kids loved the fries! I don't understand why the line was out the door. We wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"They are ALWAYS busy and there is at least 6 cars in drive-thru no matter what time of day it is, but it's worth the wait!   Indeed, their menu is limited but the burgers are really good. The beef patty is thick and juicy, the lettuce and tomatoes are fresh and never limp, and the In-and-Out sauce completes the meal. Keep in mind that you can personalize your burger, like protein style (wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun) or animal style (extra spread with grilled onions on top).  I always get a double double with cheese and animal style fries."}
{"text":"For those how have tried Inn-n-Out Burger, it's a no brainier. For those who haven't, you have to try it. I don't eat fast food, but I will make an exception for Inn-n-Out Burger! This one was like all the others, fast, friendly service and excellent food!"}
{"text":"I cannot go to Vegas without stopping at my favorite place!! I absolutely love this!! I go as soon as I get off the plane!! And again before I leave!  I love it ANIMAL style!"}
{"text":"Mike G. (a major Vegas carnivore) is right.   In N Out is an excellent and consistent burger chain that for a fraction of the cost is as good as many of the high-end burger hustlers in the casinos. (I'm talking to you BLT!)  It's even better when you know the Secret Menu.   http://www.in-n-out.com/secretmenu.asp  A 4x4 with everything on it is a sublime decadent pleasure. It's for real men only so bring your loin cloth.  I take one star off only because the fries are not as good as the burgers: you can order them well-done, but that just makes them hard. They are fresh-cut but they need to be double-fried to be done properly. Alas, no one seems to do fries that way. Sigh."}
{"text":"double-double, protein style, with pickles and spread only please. and a medium iced tea. in-n-out gets it. i like my burger the way i like it, and they don't mind serving it my way. they have never screwed up my order. they have the best iced tea, and fresh lemon wedges that aren't pathetically small. they pay their workers a fair wage, and you can tell - they're all nice and happy. love me some yummy, cheap eats and service with a smile!"}
{"text":"When it comes to fast food places,  I seriously doubt anyone gets too serious about reading reviews but I just wanted to say that every time I go to this In and Out it's super crazy busy but they are remarkably fast with the orders and all the kids working here are in a super good mood.  The service here is actually really good. I know if I worked in a place like this... I don't know but I'd probably cry or blow up at somebody. The food is decent too. If I have to eat a fast food burger, this would definitely be my number one pick."}
{"text":"This in n out is always busy! But the employees work super fast. I was surprised my food came out within 5 minutes considering the amount of people ahead of me. The place is clean too, always seeing workers cleaning and sweeping.   Okay, story time. Clumsy me, I wrapped my Invisalign retainers in a napkin and mistaken it for trash. By the time I realized it was gone, we were already on the freeway. I quickly called in n out, but it transferred me to corporate. I explained to the lady what had happened and she contacted the manager. I was already turning back to in n out. When I got there these 2 boys were going through all the trash cans and I felt so bad. I insisted that if it wasn't there, it's fine.  However, one of the boy said to me, that this is fun and he didn't mind at all because it was different and not the same boring routine. He had a positive attitude and was very determined. The fact that he was so happy to do this instead of being grumpy from going through the trash, made it a better experience.  The other boy decided to check the waste in the back and it felt like a miracle! He came out with the retainers in the wrapped napkin, just how I left it. I was so happy I wanted to give him a hug lol. but i didnt! This was all less than 10 mins, when I got int the car, the lady from corporate called me back to inform that they found my trays.   I was really grateful that corporate and the in n out manager had good and quick communication skills. Makes me love in n out so much more."}
{"text":"I love In N Out, but this location has messed up my order the last two times I've been here. I know it's the busiest location because it's off the strip, but come on. The first time they gave me someone else's order, and this time, they forgot my onion on the burger. One time can be glossed over as \"they were busy,\" two times is definitely a get your sh*t together sort of deal."}
{"text":"I visited In N Out with my family on our trip to Arizona; we hadn't been here in 5 years or so. I don't know what I ever saw in this place. After having Five Guys, I'm pretty disappointed with this chain of restaurants and their overhyped burgers/fries. I ordered a normal burger with a side of fries. The burger was very mediocre. I think Burger King or Wendy's is probably 2X better; the price is about the same, as well. The bun was the best part of the burger. Other than that, not much when it comes to flavor or quality. The fries were NOT fresh whatsoever. It was later at night, about 8 PM, but I figure that is no excuse. I get freshly made fries at Five Guys for what, $2 more? The fries were soggy, soft, and tasted like they had been left out for hours. What a disappointment! I will not be coming back, it isn't worth the money, your wallet and stomach will both thank you!"}
{"text":"First time here I will be back very good food I would recommend coming here you get your money worth"}
{"text":"Busy place! Definitely glad I finally had the chance to eat at one. Burger was tasty & fresh. Prices were cheap! Too bad they don't have these on the east coast!"}
{"text":"it is in n out, nuff said. bomb burgers and great value"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for almost 10 years and the quality of the food here has always been consistent! My go-to is a double double protein style with animal fries. Always makes my day.  Service is super friendly and that hasn't changed after all this time! For the younger age of the staff, I am truly impressed by their work ethic and professionalism.   Of note, the drive thru here takes a bit longer (all burgers are made to order to ensure freshness). Sometimes there's an employee outside who will take your order in person from your car window. During busier lunch or dinner hours, expect to wait around 20 min in the drive thru. But hey, it's worth it.   At this point it goes without saying that In-N-Out is the best fast food burger joint hands down, in terms of quality and service. This location certainly lives up to that reputation!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Best burgers. And their customer service is great too. Always fast and efficient. Even though every time I go there's a huge line of people the wait is always less than 5 minutes. Food comes out fresh each and every single time. Clean place too."}
{"text":"THE WORST experience of my life! The service was good and fast but the food tasted like has been frozen for years! Remember the hot dog  commercials back in the day where they advertised that the hot dog would fit in the bun? Well maybe they should of sold one to In-N-Out Burger! The burger filled about half to 60% of the bun. Also the milk shake I got was basically ice cream in a cup. The hype is way over rated! I will never set foot in one again it's not like we don't have enough burger joints to chose from! Two thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Burger was good. I'm not a fan of their fries. It's like eating hard air. But that's my opinion. Great service."}
{"text":"Never come here at the stroke of noon...unless you like to wait in line!   Nothing makes the afternoon like consuming a Double Double Animal Style...and since I do the \"low carb\" thing... I get it \"protein style\" (wrapped in lettuce, sans bun)."}
{"text":"Well went to this expecting one of the best burgers I ever ate because of another shift that I know from La told me she couldn't wait to get back because of this In and Out Burger place the hell's disappointed if I ever see her I'm going to ask for all my money back because honestly it sucked"}
{"text":"Think most peopl understand what you can get an In-N-Out...Since we don't have any in Portland I do try to get some in Las Vegas when I'm down there...Just don't tell my trainer or my wife... why the five stars?  The service was above and beyond!  I don't care if they pay their employees a little more than regular fast food joints the service here was amazing.  Hi, goodbye, how is everything, can I take that for you, have a great day...by more than one employee and all but one had to be under 21 years old. In this day and age that's a big deal. Great work!"}
{"text":"This afternoon I was craving a classic hamburger and fries meal with a soda. I am on round 2 of low iodine diet as part of radioactive iodine treatment for thyroid cancer. Note the scar on my neck :) . Anyway today at 2pm I was allowed out of isolation because my radioactive levels were safe for others to be around but still on this restricted medical diet. I wanted to splurge so I waited for my daughter to get home from HS and headed straight for in and out burger as they are a 'safe' restaurant for my diet with a few restrictions / modifications to the menu. I ordered my meal and then realized oh no what type of salt do they use on their fries ? I walked back up to the counter and the guy who had originally taken my order Gabe saw I was asking a question so he stepped in. I had already shown him the screenshot of my order and simply explained a medical diet  and apologized for being difficult when ordering so it was nice that he helped me again. I said do you put salt on the fries and is it non iodized. He said he thinks it's the same as the packers in the lobby. I said better skip it then just to be safe. He told the cook to modify my order and then took out a plastic to go napkin/fork/ salt set and said there is non iodized packets in here for you. I walked back to my seat with my salt packet. A few minutes later Gabe again walked over and said that he called customer service to ask for me and they do use the salt I am allowed to have. I couldn't thank him enough for first his help when ordering, and now this. My number was called and I grabbed my food. When I got back to the table to eat. I teared up a little bit at the thought of this young worker not knowing what I was going through, just doing his part to help was just so overwhelming. I dabbed my eyes and my daughter snapped a photo to capture the joy. Thank you Gabe for a great meal and even better experience."}
{"text":"Hell yes, I love me some In-N-Out Burger.   This place is fantastic! The staff are always in an oddly fantastic mood, the service is impeccable, food sensational and you can't beat the price!! I prefer to get my cheeseburger 'Mustard Grilled' - I don't like mustard - but you can't really taste it, they add pickles and it's delightful. The fries taste like big Potato Stix and aren't greasy at all! The secret menu is a must-try.   We come here every Sunday after church and it's a fantabulous tradition. :D"}
{"text":"It's really unfair of me to review In-N-Out because I'm partially obsessed. We come for lunch every Sunday after church and I get the same thing each week: #2 mustard fried with pickles and a root beer. Holy Moses, it's one of my favorite things in this world!"}
{"text":"This is a good in and out. Bathrooms are clean and tables are always cleaned promptly after being used. Our food has come out timely for the in and out chain, but is about 50/50 whether it is burned - usually depends on whose working. If you go during \"rush hours\" food is spectacular, if you go late night or at 3 pm you can either expect a wait or lesser quality food, which is pretty common for fast food places in general. Staff is always friendly which is nice, and you can't beat the prices!"}
{"text":"This burger, fries and shake rocks wherever you are. Fresh hot double-double."}
{"text":"Walked in to find a long line, but we weren't deterred because we were willing to wait to try In-N-Out for the first time. The line moved quickly and even if it didn't it would have been worth a longer wait! I ordered the Cheeseburger (#2) and added onions and pickles. It also came with fresh fries and a soda...I also decided I had to try a chocolate milk shake. My food was amazing! Both the burger and the fries tasted extremely fresh, so much so that it even felt kind of healthy! :) The milkshake was creamy and chocolatey and yummy! I will definitely visit this restaurant again whenever I get the chance! I really wish there was an In-N-Out on the East Coast!!"}
{"text":"First time eating at an In N Out!  Well I would say it's just slightly above average based on this experience.  I went for lunch and ordered the double double combo w/ cheese fries.    I do enjoy how they give you some unique \"customization\" options to the burger.  I ordered mine with lettuce, tomato, cheese, and grilled onions instead of raw onion.  It also had their version of a thousand island dressing on it which is good on any burger.  The fried were typical cheese fries, but atleast you can tell that their fries are fresh real potato.   I didn't really mess around with the secret menu, but might give it a try next time.  I know some people think In N Out is the best thing out there, but I wouldnt go out of my way to get some."}
{"text":"OMG....  Here's what you need to get:  -4x4 -make it animal style -then go ahead and make it protein style -while you're at it you're at it you should get some fries and throw some animal style it's way too!!!"}
{"text":"Busy busy... long lines even later at night. This place is pro though, they were cranking out the food like nobody's business. It's close enough to the strip that you can kind of see it from there, but challenging to get to without a car/taxi."}
{"text":"My overall favorite for burger & fries. Simple menu, good customer service and excellent double cheeseburger. Get it animal style and the fries well done. Fast, fresh and a good meal for the price."}
{"text":"In-N-Out Burger is always a treat.  Like many travelers, I cant wait to get off the plane and grab a Double-Double as soon as I land.  This location is close to the strip and a nice establishment.  I came around 2pm on a Thursday and there was a long line for the drive-thru (maybe 20 cars), but only a few people on line inside.  I got my food in about 10 minutes and ate it on the way back to the Casino. They make everything fresh to order and it definitely shows. Meat was fresh and perfectly charred as always.  The buns are like little pillows and the amount of cheese is perfect to cover everything.  I really like the sauce, but am kind of over the animal style.  I prefer to taste the meat - it is so good! This is a great value - esp in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Been going there since it opened. Just recently learned it was christian owned. Hence, I saw and never noticed Scripture on a few of the items. Basic burgers and fries that is fresh and yummy!"}
{"text":"Well first off i have had many burgers from fast food to gourmet and i have to say that these burgers are up there in my top 5!! ....... I do however think it is the best fast food burger out there with the best price!  I absolutely love their little green peppers too they are a  must have if you like jalapeños!!"}
{"text":"KEEP YOUR ONIONS AWAY FROM US NON ONION LIKERS! lol but seriously I would love this place but they ALWAYS get their onions on my burgers and then I start heaving and call angry  it's not good for anyone ! Not everyone likes onions !!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to an In-N-Out for years and for some reason I was thinking their food was something special.  I made a special note to visit one when I was in town as they aren't available in my home town.  About the only good thing I can say for this restauarant is that the prices are cheap compared to most fast food chains these days.  Unfortunately both the burgers and fries were of very low quality.  We ate less than half and walked out.  I don't understand why people keep coming here."}
{"text":"Food is always good. Can't miss with a double double, fries and a chocolate shake. We are eating outside and it's beautiful!"}
{"text":"I'm not even sorry for this review. What is the insane hype about this place? I had been out west before, heard of In-n-Out before, and was always berated by people when they found out I had been in California/Vegas but hadn't gone to this burger place. I finally made my way back out to Vegas and tried it out with high hopes. Took me about 5-6 hours to realize that it was so average/below average that I couldn't even believe it. The patties are thin, they have no flavor, and the animal sauce is nowhere near as special as Mac Sauce. I'm shocked that people think this place is good, almost to the point where I think I must be wrong. I'll try it again tmrw but I am sure that this place is missing many of the fundamentals of a good burger; needless to say their fries are also garbage. Johnny rockets is better than this place, and five guys wins without a conversation. So disappointed, in the restaurant, of course, but also in the percentage of humanity that advocates so heavily for a garbage burger chain. Good logo"}
{"text":"The burgers are great and the service was quick. My kids loved this place and it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"As a born-and-bred native of the East Coast, I have never, up to this point, had food from an In-n-Out restaurant.  We just don't have them here, never heard of them - unless it's from my West Coast friends, who have all raved for YEARS about the wonder that is supposed to be this food.  So my husband and I are going to Vegas for a week, and I tell him, \"Before I do anything else, I want to go to In-n-Out.  I want to find out what a freaking Double-Double Animal Style is.  And the shakes.  I want to know what's the big deal here.  Take me there.\"   My husband just laughs at me.  He's from Vegas.  He knows what it's about.  But he humors me anyway.  Love that man.  We pull in.  I run excitedly for the door.  I'm about to taste this burger that everyone's been raving about.  This is IT!  I order the Double-Double Animal Style.  The fries.  The shake.  This is going to blow thousands of calories - but it's worth it, they said!  I sit at the impeccably clean table.  I unwrap.  Oh, it looks good.  I pick up my burger, take that bite, and.....  I was completely UNDERWHELMED.  What the hell is THIS?  Don't get me wrong.  The burger was good.  It tasted just fine.  But....where is the manna from heaven I was expecting?  Why does this just taste.... like a fast food burger, albeit a little better than Mickey D's or Burger King?  And the shake tasted NO better than either of the aforementioned places.  Matter of fact, I'd go so far as to say that Jack in the Box (another place we don't have on the East Coast) makes a much better shake.  Now, I'm well aware that this review will be considered utter BLASPHEMY to In-n-Out fanatics.  That's fine.  I liked it - but the buildup is NOT warranted.    The restaurant was sparkling clean, which is a definite plus, and the service was good, so there's that.  Good.  But nothing more than that."}
{"text":"I am somewhat new to In-N-Out phenomenon (the last couple years). As far as fast food burgers go, In-N-Out is as good as it gets.  Last year I was in Vegas for the college hoops tournament. One evening we made a planned trip to In-N-Out. The cab driver was shocked that we were all so excited to go to a fast food burger place. Coming from the east coast, it is a mini-tradition while in Vegas. If you have a local In-N-Out you just wouldn't understand -- we don't have that luxury.  Somehow, even with all the hype, In-N-Out lives up to expectations."}
{"text":"Absolutely impressed here. Went in around 7 PM to order for 10+ people at work. We had an extremely complex order, and the cashier nailed it without me having to repeat anything. Then he went ahead and personally made sure every single item was correct and in the boxes/bags. It was all ready in under 10 minutes including 12 burgers,12 shakes, 10 fries, etc.  The food was absolutely superb. This was only my 2nd time at an In N Out being from the East Coast, and I finally learned about animal style, and it was amazing.   The only downside is that it requires a RUN across an offramp to walk here. The sidewalk just freaking ends on Tropicana for about 300 yards. Lame. We had to go back and get our car.  Oh and to feed 12 or so of us was $70. Amazing."}
{"text":"They never fail me! Great burgers and fries, super fresh and quality ingredients. Staff is always pleasant! Brought friends who had never had it before, needless to say they visited again before ending the 4 day trip."}
{"text":"I love the food here but the last few times the dining room has been a very dirty. As we waited for our food there were maybe 5 tables that need to be cleaned- we ended up cleaning a table do we could sit and eat."}
{"text":"My husband says, \"Can you write a review when I brought you food and you did not go to the restaurant?\" I replied, \"Yes I can!\" Love In and Out! In fact, people who live in states without In and Out are jealous of those of us who are able to enjoy the succulent burgers whenever we want! The burgers are juicy and yummy. I am not a huge fan of the fries, but because the burgers are so good, the fires are really an after thought for me. I wish they would embrace the idea of a curly fry. No one really offers a good curly fry any more. Other than Chipolte, this is the only fast food my hubby and I eat, and we eat it rarely, but now with the new location, we are becoming regulars. So glad they are breathing new life into this area which is our part of town!"}
{"text":"It's an in-n-out, quality burgers for super cheap. What's not to like? Nothing out of the ordinary about this in-n-out, except it's not in California!"}
{"text":"its everything i thought it would be and more. the only way i feel comfortable eating here is by immedietly before and after self flagellating."}
{"text":"Best burgers & animal fries I've EVER had. And I've had in n out all over the USA. Which makes it bizarre. It wasn't greasy at all! Quite exceptional. Will be coming here again Soon!!"}
{"text":"First time here and the burgers are delicious  fries were good also. The strawberry shake though gave me life!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, fries, and shakes. One of the most popular In-n-out places in Vegas and this can tend to make the wait time long. The crew is efficient and friendly, so they get through the crowds somewhat quick. Animal  style is a fun way to go for a different tasting burger and fries."}
{"text":"When in town for a wedding, I was excited to be able to try the famed IN-N-Out burger  animal style. Being an East Coast native I love 5 Guys little cheeseburgers and the peanut oil cooked fries doused in vinegar and wanted to compare for myself. I like the fact that is a drive-thru, so it really is a fast food restaurant. Prices are lower and they have milkshakes which I unfortunately I did not order, because I didn't want to go overboard on calories. Silly I know.  The verdict is that I much prefer 5 Guys over In-N-Out. Maybe I don't normally eat my burgers animal style so I wasn't comparing apples to apples, but I thought the fried onions tasted like the artificial onion soup packet. The fries were just boring and had no flavor and don't want to add a bunch cheese just to give it flavor.  I will try it again just to order my burger the way I normally eat them and skip fries and order a shake."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am here at this location on blue diamond very frequently and i absolutely loved every other previous experience .   Today was a little different the cashier Arielle was extremely out of line and rude if I had not already left her with my money I would've taken it and went somewhere else I do not plan on returning to this location. Which is very upsetting due to how close it is to my house guess I'll be taking my money elsewhere. Hope to try again in the future."}
{"text":"Anyone who doesn't agree that In-N-Out has the best burgers in the fast food industry can fight me. You can literally watch them make your order right in front of you, so you already know it's as fresh as it gets! The best part? The freshly cut fries! They cut the potato right there and toss is right into the fryer! Definitely not like other places where they purchased fries pre-cut and frozen. And since they're freshly cut and immediately tossed into the fryer, they're not and hot and crispy! However, for those that like that extra crunch to their fry, they can order it extra crispy and they'll make it that way for you! My friend ordered her fries that way, and with me being the type of girl who enjoys texture, it really hit the spot!"}
{"text":"There are a number of In-n-Out's around town at this point and, though it seems like everyone knows the 411 on this wonderful chain of delicious burgerness, we should keep in mind that our neighbors to the east may have never been to one.   So here's the deal: the menu has three different items, in a few different sizes. Those items are burgers, fries, and shakes. The burger can be a single patty cheese burger or a double, and the fries can be medium or large. Nothing really too complicated here, folks.   What will catch a first-time In-n-Outer off guard is how goddam delicious it all is. Greasy, yes, but they do use fresh veggie oil for fries and cut the potatoes in house.   There is also the famous \"Secret Menu\" that isn't posted in the restaurant. I am semi-familiar with it but it is mostly comprised of specialty orders, like grilled onions for your burger, called \"Animal Style,\" or easier ways of calling out if you want extra tomatoes, or in the case of lettuce instead of the bun \"protein style.\" Also, for a bigger burger (more than two patties) call it a 3 by 3 for three patties, 4 x 4 for four, etc.  The owners of the chain have been extremely careful with franchising and supposedly are keeping the owners within the family. Also, there is a widespread theory that the owners are Mormon, evidenced by Biblical citations on the bottom of drink cups and underneath fry baskets.  If that is true, that's just one more reason that Jesus would give these tasty burgers two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Never disappoints! The cheeseburger was mouth watering. If you ask for onions, they literally put an entire thick slice of onion--yum! I wish the fries would be more crispy, but I like how thin they are and that you can watch them slicing real potatoes! So cool that there are Bible verses on the bottom of the cups, too!"}
{"text":"I'm from So Cal so I bleed In N Out. The burgers are great for the price, always good quality, and are my favorite burgers hands down. If you've never tried it, it is well worth it,  guaranteed."}
{"text":"Havent had this joint in awhile. Simply, heaven. However, this particular location made us a dried out burger and fries! Friendly staff though."}
{"text":"The line is discouraging but it goes fast!!  Never disappointed. Don't change a thing!!"}
{"text":"Great food, fast and fresh! Simple menu but my kids request it often! Just there tonight....cheeseburger delicious and fries hot and freshly cut! Always bring my friends from out of state here!"}
{"text":"Oh man, a double double protein style, always so so good. This place is always busy but they are fast too."}
{"text":"Superb! In the words of Samuel L. \"That is a tasty burger.\"  I dined in at this location. My burger was perfect - warm bun, crisp veggies, and perfectly cooked beef. My fries were piping hot when I got them and everything was done in a reasonable amount of time despite the restaurant being slammed. Next time in the area, I will be back!"}
{"text":"How do you not give them 5/5???? In n out is a home run every time. They get their orders perfect, including my well done fries. And they have the best Neapolitan  shakes!!!"}
{"text":"Cheeseburger animal style with a extra lettuce.  The extra lettuce has a way of cleansing the palate so that every bite has the same flavor as the first bite.  Animal style fries when I'm feeling like eating like taking it to the next level."}
{"text":"Like another reviewer wrote, \"either you like it or you don't\". It's In n Out Burger. They have burgers, fries and shakes. They're always hot, fresh and tasty. The staff is efficient and friendly. I'm not of the mindset to drive a zillion miles for one, but they're good stuff."}
{"text":"Great, quick burgers! Ask for a side of spread for your fries. Go heathy or \"healthier\" by ordering your burger protein style so it's without the bun and wrapped in lettuce."}
{"text":"I'm almost ashamed to be writing this review, because I DO NOT eat Fast Food Ever!   But twice, OK it was 3 times, I have let my hungry stomach and my teenage daughter do the thinking when it comes to lunch.   I have to say though, if they did not offer the grilled cheese, there would be no way I could be talked into going here.   I actually enjoyed my grilled cheese, basically a cheeseburger with everything but the meat, and those strangely addicting fries I really couldn't stop eating.   For Fast Food it was not bad, it didn't make me feel bad for eating it either, not even the fries, maybe its because they aren't really greasy?  Anyway, as much as I hate to admit it, the next time I'm starving to the point of not thinking and need a  quick meal, I would come back for a grilled cheese and fries for sure!"}
{"text":"I have not really been a big In-n-out burger fan over the years, but I have noticed when I do go, this is the location to go to. Even though it is by far the busiest of the valley area locations, they do the best job with the food. There is never a problem with it. They are quicker (car by car) than any location here so the most organized well operated drive thru probably at any fast food type place. Not much of a menu, but that is not the appeal of this place so I get the same thing everytime (im guessing so does almost everyone else). Because I do eat the same thing everytime here I only come here once a month or so."}
{"text":"First stop on my trip to Vegas. After a 4 hour car ride from the Grand Canyon, the only thing I could think of was IN-N-OUT. Always get my burgers animal style-- it's the only way to go! As an East Coaster, I literally dream about In-N-Out and purposefully plan vacations around In-N-Out locations. I may need to seek counseling for this! :)"}
{"text":"It's In n out. It a go to A must have, especially since we don't have one in Portland. If its your first visit. Check out the SECRET menu online. Tons of varieties for whichever your flavour may be.. Wait time was average. The girl at cashier Seemed to have a little trouble with my order even tho it was EXTREMELY simple,  nothing complex.  But hey maybe she was new or just a l9ng day.  Animal style fries - YUM!"}
{"text":"I think these burgers are overrated. By the time I got done ordering ( the # 1 and a extra cheeseburger) it was $  9.00"}
{"text":"I don't even eat fast food, yet I crave In-N-Out.  On our recent trip to LA we asked the cab drivers to stop here both on the way to our hotel, and back to the airport.  Unlike a lot of people I talk to, I am not really a fan of their animal style.  Just a good ole double double and fries.  Their service is always top notch and the burgers are just so good it makes me a little happy they aren't in Chicago because I wouldn't be able to avoid eating here all the time."}
{"text":"I gotta go at least 2x every time I'm in Vegas.  I like this location better than Tropicana because it's normally not as crowded.  Got my double-double meal and savored every last french fry.  The place was clean and service was fast.  Went once for lunch and the other time for dinner."}
{"text":"Great service. Tackled and defeated a 12x12 s/o to Bre for for helping me with order. Scott for the making the beautiful beast. Fernando for his awesome friendly customer service...even though he wouldn't sit and chat with us. I come more for the people than the food."}
{"text":"2/28/13 was the date we visited     10:30 PM on a Thursday night and it took almost 15 minutes (we were only ones in drive thru) for three burgers and two fries. Crazy!"}
{"text":"I love going to this location because it's on my way back to Arizona and the staff is always friendly. Never had an issue with an order at this one. They never rush you. I like mine a special way and most get it right"}
{"text":"Everytime I visit the west coast area, this is my must go to place right when I arrive! Of course we have plenty of great tasting burgers down around the gulf coast where I am from. But In n Out burgers have their own special taste to it. The best thing to order would be animal style. The burger was juicy and the fries were also good. The fries hardly have any salt on it at all, which I love. Makes me feel a tad bit healthier eating them...  There are other types of burger styles too such as a double or veggie style. Overall awesome place to stop by and grab burger and fries.  Def the best bang for your buck in Vegas. After an all day and night drinking orgy, go treat yourself correct at In-N-Out!!"}
{"text":"i don't know what they put in their food, but in n out can cure even the worst of hangovers. i'm talking level 5, head hanging over the toilet, don't know whether to puke or poop, head pounding, can't get up, kind of hangover. i will get up (or make my girlfriend take me) to in n out to remedy the hangover that the previous nights debauchery has left me with.  the menu is so simple and that is the true joy of in n out. i don't need the fancy schmancy double pound bacon western burger or the jalepeno triple patty annhilator. all i need is a classic cheesburger and a side of fries. or if i'm feeling adventurous, i get my fries animal style, covered in cheese, grilled onions, and that delicious special sauce. i think it might be the sauce that cures me, cuz no other burger can remedy my hangovers. my girlfriend is a vegetarian and gets a grilled cheese animal style, which is stuffed to the brim with cheese, veggies, special sauce, and grilled onions. so good i forget that it doesn't have meat in it, and is instant gratification for my stomach and head.  always great customer service, drive thru can be long, but it's worth the wait. and in the 50+ times that i've been there, they've never messed up my order. great service, great food."}
{"text":"This place is always busy until night, and the menu was very simple to choose. I can count on freshness and speed of services. Im satisfied with a double-double, french fries and a cup of soda. From a soft top, grilled hamburger bun, cheese, crispy lettuce, sliced tomatoes, and onions; all I taste and see are fresh ingredients. This is my fav fast food place in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Mad house place with lines out the door on a Sunday afternoon. I think I'll try another location next time.  Burgers delicious as usual, what more is there to say about In-N-Out. Oh yeah, cheap too."}
{"text":"So I've heard this place is all the rave but I never had a chance to try it until now, considering I'm no longer a vegetarian. Mom and I came in around 2pm and it was packed! Not even lunch time and they're packed! That's a great sign!  We ordered the single patty combos to go and it was a good 15 minute wait. The place is a little too small for the amount of business they get, in my opinion. If you're dining in, it's a game of chance to find someplace to sit.   Got the combos home and the burger was great and I have to admit, I had low expectations. One patty was more than enough. I couldn't see myself getting a double and my niece says she sometimes orders a triple! Super flavorful and I love the sauce! I have to admit that I wasn't a fan of the fries. The texture was rubbery to me. Not sure if we got an old batch but I will give them a second chance. I am not a beef burger fan, but this one was pretty darn tasty. The hype is warranted. I am a fan!"}
{"text":"As an east coaster, I was so excited to finally experience in n out. I studied the secret menu; I was ready to go. The place is obviously chaotic because people all want to try it but that's okay. Took about 15 minutes to get our food. I got the double double animal style with animal style fries. Both were good, but I don't know if I'd rush back to the west coast for it. The grilled onions were extremely overpowering too. But you couldn't eat the fries plain, they don't really stand up on their own.   Glad I tried it and got the insta pic, but I'm not running back."}
{"text":"So glad there's an In-N-Out on the strip now!! It's great if you want something quick and cheap especially after you indulge in so much food in Vegas. The line moves quickly when you order your food but it is crowded so might be hard to find a seat to eat. We love to get the animal style fries and burger!"}
{"text":"AMAZING fast food burger place  fresh is the game, simplicity is the name  double cheeseburger with thousand island sauce, fresh slice of onion and tomato, lettuce.. mmmm  fresh cut fries  vanilla shake  huge lines but they process everybody quickly so not too long of a wait in the end  theres only 2 other options on the menu : soda drinks and hamburger  LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"$3.50 for a huge double double?!  Yes, please.  Make that two.  The place was packed, both customers and employees.  But it was organized chaos.  I was 13th in line and barely waited 5 minutes for my burgers. The fries looked good, and I'll be back to try them and maybe a root beer or shake if they have those. Great, fast service, and the burgers were great!  Thin and crispy on the edges, but not overcooked.  Fresh onions.  Some type of sauce reminiscent of McDonalds' or Big Boy special sauce. No complaints, and I've had a lot of good burgers lately."}
{"text":"Fantastisk smak, service, tempo och burgare! De har bara 4 sorters burgare och pommes på menyn men det räcker långt och väl för de gör precis vad ett snabbmatsburgerhak ska göra; leverera ruskigt bra burgare! De finns i Kalifornien och Nevada"}
{"text":"I grew up on In N Out Burger in California and now my son loves In N Out and we get to have it in Arizona. Woot woot! Always consistent and fresh"}
{"text":"finally convinced by my wife to go here  this place has average burgers, but the fries are absolutely horrible they were not salted at all and they were greasy and under cooked"}
{"text":"As always, the food was great. No matter the location the food is always, as expected, fresh and delicious. I have never had a bad experience at any In-N-Out. I give serious props to the management and the owners for how well the run their businesses. I won't go on with this pleased response, only because my food is getting cold!"}
{"text":"I don't understand what all the rave is about. Its a poor man's burger joint. If you want a fast quick, cheap burger this is the place for you. If you want a real burger you need to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is a must find place to go when you're in Las Vegas.  Can be challenging to get to this location from the strip.  You need to get to Excalibur and walk down the sidewalk on the south side of Tropicana Blvd across I15.  Only will take you 10 minutes and worth the walk.  Another approach is take the 201 bus from the north side of Tropicana Blvd just south of New York New York."}
{"text":"This was the second time I've been to an In-N-Out restaurant and I was pleased with the burger.  I got a burger, protein style and an order of fries.  The burger was very juicy, and the sauce on the burger didn't overwhelm the flavor.  The fries were good.  Almost every review mentions how busy this location is and they are all correct.  We waited about 20 minutes to place and receive our order.  The parking lot was almost full near the restaurant although there's another lot north of the main one.  The interior was jammed with people.  A friend waited in line to place our order while I walked around trying to score a table.  It was almost like playing musical chairs and I finally sat at one two seater table before someone else.  SInce I don't generally buy burgers out (I like them cooked rare and most places don't do this) I have less experience with burger joints. This would have been a 4 star review but for the wait and the quickness with which we had to eat or burger to get to our show on time."}
{"text":"In the last 3+ years, I've taken 3 trips to Cali and/or Vegas.  One thing is for certain, a trip out west is not complete without a visit to In-N-Out Burger.  On my trip earlier this month, I was fortunate to have In-N-Out Burger twice, once in Los Angeles (at a wedding!) and once at this location just off the famed Las Vegas strip.  Going to In-N-Out is always an experience.  The restaurant sign is reminiscent of all the bright neon lights of the strip.  You pull into the parking lot and it's packed with cars, plus at least 5 taxi cabs too.  When you walk into the restaurant, there is a line to take your order, but it moves at a decent pace.  Above the counter is the menu.  It's pretty simple and minimalist.  The hubby and I ordered two Cheeseburgers at $2.45 each and an order of Fresh French Fries at $1.65.  Including tax our order came to $7.08.  Wow!  That's the cheapest, most affordable meal we had in our 4 days in Las Vegas.  My husband called me a cheap date!  But hey, when you have an In-N-Out craving, nothing else will suffice.  There is definitely an interesting crowd inside the restaurant, so we opted to take our food to go and brought it back to our hotel room to have with a bottle of red wine, classy I know.  I really wish In-N-Out Burger would expand to the East Coast, but I'm also pretty sure this will never happen as all of their food is fresh and never frozen, so it cannot travel too far from their processing centers.  I highly recommend stopping here on your next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place isn't bad at all.. I just wish they had more to offer. They need to get some chicken sandwiches going on. However the food and service is good and above average."}
{"text":"soooo good, the fresh fries were delish. they came out steaming hot. The hamburger was cooked to perfection and wasn't at all greasy. so far the best in and out ive been to in Arizona.  btw this place is craxy busy!"}
{"text":"I checked to make sure they had In-n-Out before moving to AZ.  'Nuff said.  They do.  They're perfect.  Always..."}
{"text":"Your typical in-n-out! Great and friendly service and the food is excellent. Place gets extremely busy though since this chain seems to be the only chain in the Vegas area. Across from the chain, there is an official in-n-out store which sells really cool and rare in-n-out merchandises including clothes. I bought one rain jacket and one winter jacket since I am from Boston. If you are a hardcore in-n-out fan like me, I think you will dig the store!"}
{"text":"No matter the time of day, this location is always insanely busy. The staff working outside by the drive through is always surprisingly friendly and the line goes fairly quick. Sometimes you just need your burger and fry fix so it's worth the wait. Everything is always hot and fresh - you can't go wrong with the traditional cheeseburger and fries. YUM."}
{"text":"My sister and her husband raved about this place so, being a burger lover, I had to try it.  I ordered the double-double, which is their top of the line burger (why wouldn't I try their best as a first timer?) and I wasn't disappointed.    The wait was a bit longer than your average fast food restaurant but that's because they make each burger fresh.  It arrived neatly wrapped and ready to eat with a side of freshly cut fries.  The bun wasn't soggy at all and every bite was as fresh as the last.  Could've been one of the best burgers I'd ever had.  I also ordered a vanilla milkshake which was SUPER thick and tasty.  I love milkshakes but hate how they can melt before you're done.  Not this one.  They're practically serving you soft-serve in a cup and straw.    The customer service was unusually excellent for a fast food place.  Sure, they are trying to resemble a 50's burger joint.  Hence, the limited menu (i.e. no swiss mushroom angus burger with jalapenos etc, no kids meals and toys, etc) and something that most fast food places have neglected.....something called customer service.  Both of the gentlemen working the floor were very kind and came over to our table multiple times to see how things were.  Very unusual for a fast food place but very welcomed!  My only gripe is that they are not open late night.  We returned from the casinos around 1:30am and they were already closed and I was really craving a good burger!"}
{"text":"Not really a lot to write here.  In-N-Out is one of my favorites and this one was no exception.  Just wish I could eat out at places like this more often."}
{"text":"My Husband Loves In- N-Out Burgers, I like them, but not my favorite, until I found out about their special ordered Animal Burger, and found out today, that they have yellow Hot Peppers, I had asked them years ago, if they had jalepeno's, and was told no, and wasn't told that they had yellow peppers, Wow !!!  What a difference the peppers make on my burgers, now I like it just as much as my Husband !!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to hate this place when I first moved out west from Chicago. After all, it's from California (gross) and Californians treat it like a god-damn cult.  Unfortunately there is some kind of virus in the air here (must be the wind patterns) that makes people shit bricks over In-N-Out. I must have contracted it because now I can't help but like it. :(  The hamburgers are decent fast-food fare as long as you add grilled onions and leave off the GOD-AWFUL spread. With the spread they taste exactly the same as McDonalds. The shakes are tasty - it's not hard to make a good shake. The fries are pretty bland but can be saved if you order them well-done.  There are so many better chain hamburgers to be had. Five Guys is way better, and Smashburger is the best. But when you're on the long, lonely road to L.A. (god forbid), the Barstow In-N-Out is pretty much the best thing along the route. And if you're a Californian tourist coming in to town, you probably can't help but be drawn to the giant sign like a neon beacon.  In-N-Out is a slightly-above-average fast food chain that, like Chick-fil-A, is good but not nearly deserving of all the hype it gets. When I want a fast food hamburger, I'll stick with Smashburger."}
{"text":"For fast food, this place is terrific. Being from the East Coast, we don't yet have these in our area, so I was curious to try one. We went through the drive thru, so I can't comment on the inside of the restaurant. It was fairly painless to place our orders, which we were able to customize. The line took slightly longer than other drive thrus, but that was fine since we were able to customize our burgers and the food was so good! Fast food fries can be hit or miss, these were terrific. They have a secret menu - you can ask for your burger \"protein style\", which is without the bun (wrapped in lettuce). They offer a double, triple, or even quad pattie burger! Surprisingly for a burger place, the secret menu also has grilled cheese! I highly recommend this place for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Always friendly smiles to ask for your order. Clean fast and fresh. Nothing better than that. Only downside is the long lines inside and in the drive thru."}
{"text":"Check your order before you dive away or you'll get a bag of fries and a bag of fries.  No burgers. Serious?!"}
{"text":"Ah my sweet In-N-Out Burger. A California staple that will always have a spot in my heart. Since moving to AZ I have been here more than a handful of times.   Every In-N-Out I have been to has never disappointed me when it came to their food. You always have the taste of fresh ingredients!  My usual is the 4x4 Protein style with grilled onions which is perfectly paired with a side of fries. Also, since I can't have enough protein I usually opt to get a flying Dutchman as well, which is just cheese in between two meat patties.  On a side note, they recently added a new item to their menu after 15 years...Hot Chocolate made with real chocolate chips!  In my eyes In-N-Out and especially this establishment, get a 5 star rating from me!"}
{"text":"Very good service (and, of course, great food)!  When we arrived, the place was packed, but it didn't take long until our food was ready. The cashier was really nice. He made sure he understood our order correctly before he took my payment. I observed other employees hard at work cleaning tables and making sure there were enough condiments. My meal was also pretty good. Overall, I was very pleased with my cheeseburger. I just wish there was a little less sauce on the bun since it made it a little soggy but otherwise it was good."}
{"text":"Good food at a good price! I got combo meals for 5 people for about $30. Like other locations for this franchise, the wait in the drive thru line was long, but they make up for it with some decent service and good food. At least there weren't any homeless people hitting me up for change while I sat in line."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I've just got one question though... What is up with the insanely (and unrealistically) happy people who work at this place? To be fair, the food is definitely worth smiling about. Then again, I'm the one ordering the food so I should be the one smiling and acting overly giddy. Most of my reviews involve complaining about the places I go where the service is poor. In this case, the service is great - just over the top - but I'll put up with that for such great food!"}
{"text":"It was OK.  Excellent prices but the burger was jusy ok and i couldn't finish the fries.  They were flavorless and almost cardboard like.  You have to know me to really appreciate that lady statement.  Ill eat any french fry and usually the left overs on my friends plate.  I LOVE french fries. I think i ate a third or half of them before i threw in the towel.  They flat out sucked.  Not sure if it's the oil they are cooked in or the quality of the fry itself but I'll NEVER order fries from here again.    The chocolate shake was AMAZING! i don't typically love fast food shakes but i couldn't get enough of this one.  I wanted more."}
{"text":"For all the hype this place gets, I was expecting a little more. A limited menu. Sort of like 5 Guys. Loud and crowded but probably because I went right after Seattle Mariners spring training game let out. Good place if you can't make up your mind what to eat and just want a burger and fries and shake. Or if you're out with the family and need a quick bite."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about in n out from friends and was super excited to try it out. Needless to say, i was NOT disappointed. Such a simple menu but delicious food. Unfortunately, we do not have In-N-Out in Florida :("}
{"text":"Awesome Burgers, fast service. When you come here, give in to the animal style everything. Well done fries, with a grilled cheese is pretty good. Fresh, not frozen, potatoes keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Double- double without onion, protein style. Animal style fries are just the best combo ever evererrrrrrer."}
{"text":"Its just makes me wonder how these guys make their burgers. I had this one time copying their delicious burger and failed to do so, dunno what did went wrong all I did was buy a burger and imitate the burger. Wiw, seems like these guys has a secret ingrediet for their burgers.  They also have nice fries, good for pairing with the burger.  Yum, In-N-Out burger is the best."}
{"text":"My first time to the west coast and my first time having In-N-Out. So good! I wish they were in the east coast. My only regret was not know about animal style before I ordered!"}
{"text":"Very, very funny...like my other pal in review here-we ALSO tried to walk here from the MGM, a nice stroll down the strip? WRONG...also had to take a cab for a 1/4 of a mile...hilarious.   Anyway, In and Outs are only in CA, NV and AZ...so whenever I am there this MI gal wants her in and out...I took my pal from Boston for the first time and she asked, \"Is this going to ruin McDonalds for me?\" Answer: YES, 100% puts McDonalds burgers to SHAME.  In and Out fries are not that great, but the burgers make it totally worth it(and you better like burgers because you can't get anything else there aside from pop and or a fantastic shake!)...unlike McD's and the rest of the places, they are literally using fresh beef to make the burger, the buns are fresh and buttered and they come with FRESH sliced tomato, onion and lettuce and a special sauce that is to die for...they use real cheese for the cheese fries too!   Bottom line...GO here if you have never been unless you want to ruin your fast food burger experience forever...."}
{"text":"animal style fries...my weakness & a double double with grilled onions = satisfied"}
{"text":"This place is a classic, so of course everyone raves about it, but in all reality-ITS REALLY NOT ALL THAT GOOD. Ya, for fast food its pretty decent, but don't expect to get anything decent here other than a hamburger. Their menu is really limited, and I know they have a \"secret\" menu with items like animal style fries, but what average person who comes here knows that? They don't offer a veggie burger or anything other than a grilled cheese which is rubbery cheese on a hamburger bun and a tomato on it..if you think this is quality food, think again. I'm not saying In-N-Out isn't better than mostly all fast food, I'm just saying it's not really the dining delicacy that everyone makes it out to be. Its just sort of average, that's all. It should be called OVERRATED instead."}
{"text":"We were in Las Vegas from Ohio, so of course as soon as we saw the In-N-Out burger sign, we HAD to have it! It was completely worth the hype. Double double without onions, fries, and a chocolate shake - it was DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"I hate the fact that this location drive thru takes really long. I like in n out but every time I come here to grab a quick meal after a long day of work the line is ridiculously long. I end up just leaving."}
{"text":"Flying into phoenix late at night on way to hotel we had to stop here to get food. Love the ipad ordering so cute. Delicious burgers wish we had on the east coast. Perfect start to our trip."}
{"text":"This is my favorite In-N-Out location. Always clean, quick service, friendly staff, big parking lot. I'll  have a double-double with grilled onions and banana peppers and fries  pls!"}
{"text":"I believe I have eaten at In N Out in every state that it exists. Being from the Midwest, this is a well-priced treat for our team!   This location was about five minutes from our hotel and we were there...OFTEN. Lol. I realize I do not have the capacity for a \"Double Double\" plus Animal Fries anymore, but I sure could tear up a single cheeseburger and Animal Fries.   In N Out is one of the FEW places where my kiddo will eat a burger! So he was delighted by the place. As always, fresh faced and friendly clerks rung us up and our order was correct.   I always like the family friendly atmosphere of In N Out! There are kiddos running around and all ages having food. It is one of the few \"fast food\" joints that seem to have avoided the \"scourge\" that is considered unhealthy eating."}
{"text":"If In-N-Out is available to us, we're goin' to it! This location treated us as well as previous ones we have been to! We headed straight there after getting settled at the hotel.   Manged to score a table outside in the shade and enjoyed our burgers and Animal Fries in peace!"}
{"text":"These are no where near Wisconsin, so when I am near one I HAVE to throw down on a combo meal.   Each time we have been here, the place has been packed, the service is awesome and the food, for FAST FOOD?? Cannot be beat.   The last time I was here I ate a double cheeseburger combo like it was my JOB. Makes me sad I am so far away from one just writing this."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful  The food was good  It was very clean and it was not that busy  We had to wait about 5 mins from when we ordered till we got our food  I would definitely say it was a great experience"}
{"text":"I worked here as a teenager and now thirty years later went to have dinner at the tropicana blvd and the worst dinner.  Cold fries and the order wasn't even correct...a cheeseburger with no cheese and cold"}
{"text":"All I can fathom is hell no.  I got two orders of fries.(Togo) checked when I got home because I trusted them to not fuck up my food. Odd totrust fast food I guess. Both fries were incinerated. The smell that came from the bag when I opened it was horrendous. My grilled cheese was also burnt! The cheese on it was hardly even there. The other burger was charred for 5 hours (so it tasted like) terrible. How dare you guys."}
{"text":"Given a choice of fast food burgers, when I'm in In-N-Out Burger territory, In-N-Out wins everytime.  Like most other fast food burgers, theirs is a thin patty.  The patty itself is good but I think that it's the sauce and the bun that make the burger distinctive.  The menu is uncomplicated---You can get a single burger, a double burger or a cheeseburger.  Plus you can get just a burger or the combo which comes with fries and a soda.  I tend to get my cheeseburger without the onions because there are way too many onions on it for my liking.  For me, too many onions can overpower the rest of the contents.  The fries are quite good when fresh and hot.  When they cool off, they're just so-so.  The buns have good flavor.  Most fast food burgers come with a tasteless, bland bun but In-N-Out has a very flavorful one.  To me, it tastes buttery with a  hint of salt.  The sauce looks like French dressing but yet adds a decidedly different flavor to the rest of the toppings.  I wish I could explain just what that flavor is---I only know that it's good!  One drawback---the burgers come out wrapped in white paper that exposes half the burger.  This is ostensibly done to make it easier to eat.  Yet...under the white wrapper is a brown wrapper and I can't tell you how many times I've taken a bite of my burger only to later discover that I bit off some brown paper and ate it along with the burger LOL!  Oh well!  A little extra roughage is always a good thing :)!  Every In-N-Out I've been to has been very busy to the point that sometimes it's tough to find a table---Even tougher when you have a large party.  In-N-Out attracts a diverse group of people---young and old, rich and poor and everyone in between.  Good for them for having such a huge customer base!"}
{"text":"Yum Yum for my Tum Tum. On those days when a greasy burger will do and I can longer fathom the thought of washing dishes I can count on a quick delicious burger to satisfy the craving. The whole family can eat here for about $20!  I remember having to drive to SoCal for an In-N-Out burger, no longer the case with many of these places scattered all over Vegas.  Animal style Cheeseburger and a Neopolitan milk shake for me please!"}
{"text":"Every time I go out West I look forward to and make sure I stop at In-N-Out burger. They never disappoint and I did it again yesterday. I sure wish they would put up some restraints out East ( I'd love to own one). Until then Ill just have to get my fix when traveling. They are the best darn burgers and fries ever. I turned down a Steak dinner at one of the expensive ,yet good Steak House chains, just to eat at In-N-Out. I'm not at all disappointed. Shakes,burgers and fries is all they do and they do it right."}
{"text":"I wish that In-N-Out would open up on the east coast. Shake Shack is good but In-N-Out is where it's at! I am not a fast food fan normally but I make rare exceptions when I'm on the west coast and I see the glowing lights of In-N-Out because I know that some Animal Style fries and a double double are within reach."}
{"text":"In all my years living in Las Vegas...why haven't I ever reviewed In-N-Out Burger???  This place is like an institution on the west coast!!  They even have one within walking distance to my college alma mater UNLV!  Yes, yes...many good memories...some very memorable, some a lil' hazy thanks to my introduction then to cheap liquor...and even cheaper college women.  Nah, just kidding!  I think...  I frequent this In-N-Out the most now a days.  Since my 1st succulent bite at In-N-Out as a prepubescent college geek I've been hooked ever since!  This is my go-to place for a burger when I don't want to think about having a burger.  It is my wingman on a Friday night when I'm doing a Taio Cruz (now sing it, S-O-L-O!), my buddy when no other cheap eats will do.  It is the Robin to my Batman, the Chong to my Cheech, the Ivory to my Ebony.  Wow, I just realized I need to get out more.  Back to the lesson at hand, In-N-Out is really what a hamburger is all about!  Really!  They got the K.I.S.S. thing (Keep It Simple Stupid) down to a science!  No overcomplicated menu, no fancy schmancy, no bad attitudes!  Just meat, cheese, potatoes!  Easy!  I have never had a bad burger at In-N-Out...ever.  If you have, either your order was wrong (which they will gladly fix), or In-N-Out isn't your kind of place!  Everything here is fresh, fresh, fresh, and that is the key to the great burger and fries.  Fresh meat (not frozen like that McDonald's place), fresh cut fries, fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and onions!  The cheese might be processed a bit, but ah, I give them the benefit of the doubt because it's so good!  And they serve COCA COLA!  Yeah, forget you Pepsi!  Sorry to all you Pepsi lovers, but I was born in GA (but yes I am Asian..and yes, I am from Hawaii) so I'm keepin' it real and being loyal to the homies out in the A-T-L.  If you've been to In-N-Out you of course have seen their main menu.  It's only got 3 combos on it!  1-The hamburger, 2-The cheeseburger, and 3-The Double-Double.  How hard can it be to log in an order?  Please!  Even a drunkard can squibble out a number and still be pleasantly fed.  But if you're a fan of In-N-Out or have been coming here for a long time you know all about the 'Secret' menu.  Right?  Come on!  OK, the cat is out of the bag:  http://www.in-n-out.com/secretmenu.asp  Was that so hard?  Now you can order like an In-N-Out connoisseur just like me!  Here's my usual whenever I hit the joint:  #2 Combo - Cheeseburger 'Animal Style' with extra grilled onions, add raw onion, extra pickle, add mustard, fries well done (trust me, they are good), and a Diet Coke with lemon  See...simple!  Deliciious!  If I'm feelin' really good that day I'll get the fries 'Animal Style' as well!  What's better than fresh fries topped with cheese, grilled onions, and In-N-Out spread?  It may not look appetizing but damn are they tasty!  Need more meat?  Get yours in a Double-Double(2 meat-2 cheese), or a 3x3 (3 meat-3 cheese) or 4x4(4 meat-4 cheese)!  I once knew a guy that liked an 8x8 (8 meat-8 cheese) but that's a bit much for me!    In-N-Out prides itself on cleanliness, so for the most part the restaurant is very tidy and not funky smelling.  Service here is fast and consistent, while still being very friendly.  Often times the line will be out the door, especially on weekends and late nights!  I constantly see 6-7 cars stacked in the drive thru on a busy day.  You know your burger is doing OK when your neighbors are Panda Express, Raisin Cane's, On the Border, and SmashBurger..and your place is still packed!  Enough of this, the thought is making my mouth water.  I will gladly run extra laps and do extra crunches for this meaty delight!  I feel so bad for you vegetarians and 'Raw' eaters.  How can you not love In-N-Out?  It puts the \"Ooooooooo\" in \"Moooooooo\"!!!"}
{"text":"The only fast food chain worthy of a 5 star rating! My East Coast friends will never know or understand what a burger at In n Out is all about! The menu is short, like three different burgers, fries, and milkshakes. However, even the shakes are only the standard three. I of course always go with the double double! What is that you ask? It's two all beef patties, finely cooked, topped with cheese, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions! It's all put together in a finely crafted piece of art that even Picasso would admire! There's a secret recipe that's not published, but if you google it you can find it. I had the animal fries, which are their fresh cut fries topped with chili, diced grilled onions, and their secret sauce which kinda like a Russian dressing! Even the likes of Anthony Bourdain admit to having a fascination with In n Out! This southern gentleman could only dream of not having to go 3,000 miles to get one!"}
{"text":"I've never had In-N-Out before. It doesn't exist in the midwest. I always put off going to In-N-Out when I'm in the west coast, but not this time. Since I'm vegan, burgers are off limits unless I want veggies between a pair of buns. Lol. I ended up with an order of fries instead. I was really excited to try these fries! Sadly, they didn't live up to my expectations. They were bland and boring. I thought the fries were below average compared to other fast food fries. There's nothing special about them. Five Guys make better tasting fries, and the portions are larger! The service was fast and responsive though!"}
{"text":"How can you dislike this place. The food is fast and it tastes the same every time. Very consistent, Deliciousness."}
{"text":"Great place! We went on a Sunday afternoon and the line was backed up to the 99cent store! I was nervous that it would take forever, but they are like chick fa la and got us in and out! Also, the food is AWESOME!"}
{"text":"2 1/2 stars  Call me crazy - but I DO NOT think in - n - out is the best burger.  It's OK, and thats where it ends.  Burgers and pizza are long time debated food items.  The truth of the matter is, it depends how you like it.  In this case, it depends what you like on your burger.  Since I'm not a fan of slices of cheap raw tomato with snotty tomato goo in the middle, crappy iceburg lettuce, and mystery hot orange sauce, in - n -out is not my burger style.  I'm more of a bacon, sliced avocado, sauteed mushrooms kind of a gal.  The meat and cheese at in-n-out is good.  The patties are flavorful and juicy and the cheesy is melty and generous.  But if you don't like their ALL-American (aka boring) toppings, that's all you get.  The fries suck - plan and simple.  I ordered fries at an in-n-out once; never again.  Now, I just stick to a burger.   Also, plan on waiting a MINIMUM of 20 minutes just for 1 burger - even at the drive through."}
{"text":"Was not impressed by In & Out.  It was very crowded with a line out the door.  The person taking orders was very friendly and they did have a couple of kids continuously cleaning the floor and clearing tables.  However, the food was sub par.  It took a while for the order (yes, i know they were busy) but you would think that with that many orders they would be constantly  making fresh fries, but 'no'.  And worst, not only were the fries not hot but they were like cardboard lacking flavor and dry not moist on the inside.  The best part of the burger was the lettuce and tomato.  The meat was tasteless.  Not sure it is worthwhile to go there just to say you have been to an I&O burger"}
{"text":"I've eaten different In-N Out places. This location is probably the busiest I've been to so far and this location has a gift shop.   To me, this place is the best burger place with speedy service and consistency. I love places with few things on the menu and they make it to perfection. I'm a simple kind of person so I don't need nothing fancy but excellent food and service. Every person who works here work to their fullest. I haven't met anyone who are lazy or mess up my orders like the other fast food chains.   Unfortunately, I wasn't able to eat another meal here on Christmas day because they were closed. Although I was disappointed, I'm happy for the workers who are able to spend Christmas with their families.   Lastly, I like to clarify a rumor, In-N-Out will never come to Hawaii. The gift shop person tells me that's like building a bridge between Hawaii to California. Their quality control is that strict."}
{"text":"In N Out Burger is not just a burger joint. It is THE burger joint. I couldn't believe how tasty the burger and the fries were. It is FRESHEST ever!!!  Yes, for a big place, it was packed with people inside and out. I also noticed there were taxis parked. That's a good sign right. People are paying extra money to get good food.  I love their simple menu. You choose from 3 types of burger, fries, drinks, shakes and that's pretty much it. Yes, I love the simple and basic. I order 2 cheeseburger combos. Even though it was a full house, my order was ready within 10 minutes. I love the efficiency too! You can't tell how the burger by looking at the photo. You gotta eat it to get the full experience. Buns were nicely toasted. The beef patty was soft and juicy. It also had organgy sauce for the burger kind of similar to Big Mac sauce. But it tasted perfect. It came with load of fries and I did tell myself that's way too much fries. I never finish my fries EVER. The French fries were out of this world. It was so fresh. You can hardly taste the oil or grease. As it says on the paper tray, potatoes are cut fresh daily. Sadly, fries were gone in no time. I need to order extra next time. I also got a vanilla shake. It was creamy and thick. It's the old-fashioned way.  Once again, this is the freshest burger AND fries I ever had in my life. I would give 6 starts if I could. I love the old-fashioned way too!"}
{"text":"Flavorless. Pointless to go if you don't know the secret menu. Everything I tried on the menu was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst experience I have ever had with in n' out in my entire 29 years on this planet. This chain closes at 1:30 AM on Saturday nights. I specifically pulled up at 1:29 AM when they proceeded to turn the lights off in the drive-through and failed to even acknowledge my presence. They served the car in front of me yet failed to even speak to me. This is not my first rodeo upon closing hour, and the right thing to do would have been to take one last order before that 1:30 mark. We pulled up and they made sure to cut the lights 30 seconds AFTER we pulled up into the drive-through. This is the closest chain to my house but sadly I will not be returning unless somebody makes it right. Sincerely, a very unhappy camper.  ***Update - we were all drinking and had the munchies which makes this experience that much more painful"}
{"text":"I grew up eating these burgers and this one was exactly the way they're supposed to be. Crunchy toasted bread, melted cheese, big handful of cold crisp lettuce. I like mine with grilled onions and mustard instead of their normal spread. The fries were crisp, animal style is best. Service was friendly and fast.   In n out sometimes gets compared to modern burger restaurants and then people are disappointed. Don't do that. It's a fast food drive through. Compare it to Mc Donald's and Jack in the box etc and you'll understand why I stop in every time I'm on the west coast."}
{"text":"As with any in and out, the food is absolutely delicious. The service was fast, and the staff was very accommodating to our complex orders. My only complaint would be that the bathrooms weren't very clean, but otherwise it was a good meal."}
{"text":"This place gets it!! Where are you going to get a double double awesome burger and a nice sized strawberry shake for 5.50 !!! The combo meal with fries is 6.75..... Cheaper than McD's !! Great value to say the least. Rock on in and out!   Lol.....head over to 5 GUYS and pay almost 30.00 for two people to eat! WRONG!! My burger and fries at black angus was13.00 last week!! Geez! Go try fatburger and pay 10-15 per person !  crazy!"}
{"text":"Long lines, but close enough to the strip to get your animal style grub on after clubbing it up!  Fresh beef, and fries that are hand cut from an actual potato?!?!  Love it!"}
{"text":"Love the food and service.  Only one problem.  Girl at drive up kept touching her hat, hair, face and then handling food.  Not good."}
{"text":"I love their burgers.  You can only get them on the west coast.  Research the off menu items before you go for the first time.   Its definitely a treat."}
{"text":"It's In & Out! What can I say that hasn't been said thousands of times over? The food is always great!!! The only problem is the cleanliness- I have never sat down to a table that was clean ( or the seats ) at this location."}
{"text":"This place always provides excellent customer service. It's consistent as far as the food goes. The burgers are very good all tastes fresh. My family loves this place."}
{"text":"Visited this location many times over the years and have always left a happy customer. I would think twice about coming here on the weekend, but week days this place is solid gold. The only thing I would change is the hours they are open, I would it it any time of the day of they stayed open."}
{"text":"Its about time they made an In N Out near me. Just last night I made a late night run with my BFF for some Animal Fries, a double double w/ extra spread and a Neapolitan shake. So effing GREAT. Their staff and service is always excellent. Definitely my diet \"cheat\" spot."}
{"text":"In town for some birthday celebrations for a friend, I immediately knew that we'd have to hit up an In-N-Out. Being the food nerd that I am, had heard of this west coast/southwest regional staple years ago, and I even have a book on its history.   We came in the mid-afternoon but there was still an impressive line up of at least 15 people, plus others waiting for their orders. What I saw in the store added up with what I had previously heard - a clean store, tiny menu with rock bottom cheap prices (especially compared to fast food in Canada), and a general old school kind of feel. There's no corporate attempts at modernizing, just the same thing that has made In-N-Out what it is today.   Naturally, I'd heard of their not so secret menu by this point and came armed knowing what I wanted. The line chugged along and orders were coming out of the kitchen at a blistering pace. When it came my time to order, I went with a double double animal style, well done fries and a strawberry shake. I'd like to think I sounded like I knew what I was talking about.   We patiently waited for a little while and beheld the spectacle of the well-oiled machine of this In-N-Out's kitchen. A few dozen orders later, I had my deep, red tray in hand and hunkered down to eat.  The fries were noticeably darker than my friend's, but not over done, just an eye-pleasing golden brown. They took on an interesting texture being cooked such that they weren't very fluffy inside, just crisp nearly all the way through. It wasn't a fry epiphany for me, but I definitely preferred them over the regular fries.  The burger itself was a sight to behold - the sauteed onions, extra sauce and pickles nearly pouring out of the container. It was a great flavour overall, even if it did somewhat overshadow the beef itself. What bites of unadulterated beef I could get, they were good - beefy, and moist and a little bit of zing from the mustard it was cooked in. The only downside and a very nit-picky one was that the thick slice of beefsteak tomato was distractingly thick and cooled down the burger. All in all, it was a wonderful, hot mess of a burger.  The shake was a fine execution of the classic dessert drink - thick, but not impossible to suck up the straw and the pleasant familiarity of the strawberry flavour.  With my visit later in the day to a Michelin-starred restaurant, I was able to tick off two big items on my foodie \"to do\" list. In-N-Out definitely lived up to the hype for me, and I look forward to when I'm next in a city that has one."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try an In-N-Out burger but not living near the west coast...that isn't available. I finally got to try it and it was so worth it! It was hotter than Hades out there when we went to visit (late June 2017) when it was around 110 degrees+ every day. Seating was taken inside so I went outside to wait for my husband (the concrete seats were incredibly hot - wish I had had a towel to sit on...that was my only complaint). The burger was spot on! The fries were equally as good. It was much needed on a day when I was struggling."}
{"text":"This location uses WAY too much raw onion. It was so potent and overpowered the entire double-double. It literally made my mom sick to smell and me sick by eating it. They need to get their onion game together.. Not worth the wait-- go to other local locations or ask for no onions"}
{"text":"My favorite fast food burger hands down!  I live in WV and it had been 5 years since I had one of these burgers.. it was everything I remembered when I took a bite . The grilled bun and special sauce are incredible. The location of this particular one is very cool.  Located on the Linq promenade, you can sit outside and people watch (the best part of Vegas) while eating.  Long line that moves really fast so don't let that deter you.  I can't wait to go back already!"}
{"text":"They have fast, friendly and competent workers at this InO. You can't go wrong coming here."}
{"text":"Hands down this is the best place to get burgers. I love there secret menu the animal style burger and the animal style fries. Usually for this location it gets really busy so you could be waiting in line for a little bit. They just open location up last year. the atmosphere is always packed, but the food is worth waiting for. I'm so glad they built one here near the Biltmore area."}
{"text":"Life is finally complete now that there's an In N Out in central Phoenix!!!!! Goodbye hunger....hello fat boy jeans :p"}
{"text":"I come here often. I always get the same thing. A cheeseburger with only pickles and tomatoes combo with a strawberry shake. They never get it wrong, it's delicious every time, and I've never had a problem with staff. Only been inside once so I couldn't tell you about cleanliness. 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've never had In N Out burger as I live in the Chicago area. We are limited to Culver's, Portillo's, White Castle...and recently Sonic has opened (which I was so excited about until I tasted it - disgusting. I am off track.   In N Out Burger - uhhh, YUM!! I mean, it's no kobe beef burger with an ice cold beer but it's pretty darn good for a fast food joint. I've been to plenty of fast food burger joints and this is up at the top of the list. I would have gladly eaten two double-double burgers without hesitation. My other midwestern friends agreed.   If you never tried it and have the opportunity to do so - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love in n out? Amazing burges, shakes, fries and friendly service. This location is always packed but they manage to get orders out pretty fast."}
{"text":"To say the least, this place just serves great food. If you're not from here you definitely need to come to any of their locations and grab a double double with well done fries and a shake. This is probably the best combination I can think of when coming here.   The only thing is you're pro ably and most likely going to have a long wait for the line but that's to be expected with good food and at a great price too. If you go to a generic fast food chain such as McDonald's or Burger King that will just be a disappointment just because missing out on such a good meal should be a crime.   The burger buns are placed on the grill so the edges are nice and toasty. With every bite you can taste the special sauce they lather inside which is the spread and their crispy letter even they put in between the buns. In the end you most definitely won't be disappointed with the burger once waiting that long line."}
{"text":"Fast service and the burgers never disappoint. Also the shakes are just indescribable, not too sweet but totally worth all the calories at the end"}
{"text":"Always good service and great food !! I can wait 20 min to get my food ! To get great food u need to wait! Lol"}
{"text":"great burgers and horrible fries and great soda and great nice service.  in walmart shopping center"}
{"text":"Just coming back from our dancing class and do not feel like cooking dinner. So here we are at the famous In and Out. They again come to the rescue so that I don't have to cook. The store is always busy, I opted for drive thru tonight. The cashier on the other side of the speaker was clear and concise on taking my order. She even repeated it back to make sure that it was correct.   The line to get to the window was long but well worth the wait for there burgers. I ordered cheeseburgers, fries, and milk for us all. I did not want all the extra condiments or garnish so went old school with the toppings; just meat and cheese. The order was made correct and was ready when I got to the window. A swipe of the card and we were off with dinner. The only thing we could not help after dancing we were so hungry that we ate it in the car."}
{"text":"After visiting UNLV, we were all hungry must of  been since we were all using our brains. We decided to fuel our minds with cheeseburgers, shakes, and fries from In and Out. The service was great here but slow. We waited in line to place our order for about seven minutes and then waited over ten for our order. It was around 8:00 pm at night so they were not that busy, but the drive they was wrapped around the building.   When we did receive our order the food was great , made the way we ordered it, and hot. Just the way I like it of course. Our shake was chocolate and really pairs nicely with the cheese burger; it really brings out the flavor making them do a dance in your mouth ."}
{"text":"I'll give it four stars because it's good priced, quick and nice service, and good food. Now, it's missing a star because it made my husband and I sick.... as in, vomiting and diarrhea sick. How do we know? It was the last thing we ate yesterday afternoon, and when we threw up about 6 hours after eating it, it was their food... specifically the Caramelized  onions.... and.... here we are, the very next day, STILL bedridden with dehydration and nausea and vomiting still... IN VEGAS :-( next time my husband insists we walk 100 miles to a burger joint, im saying heck no!!"}
{"text":"Another trip to in n out and it was as good as usual. Boyfriend said his burger was kinda dry but mine was just fine."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been said about In-N-Out.... It is AWESOMELY DELICIOUS!!! I like this location by UNLV better than the one off of Flamingo & Dean Martin Drive. That location is for the tourist who didn't rent a car or didn't check google maps for other locations. I like to order my burgers here animal style which is their special sauce that resembles thousand island dressing with cooked onions. If you get a chance to go to an In-N-Out burger, get onto the internet to see the special menu."}
{"text":"Best In N Out ever. I wish it was 24/7. This place has me craving their double double protein style burgers at all hours of the day. I don't like fast food... But this is the exception. I've been to In n Outs in CA, and TX... This one does it perfectly! They always get my order right. I'm sitting in line right now waiting for a burger... Thankful that they're open and I'll get a tasty treat soon! Thanks In n Out!  so worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I don't know what it is we East Coast-ers did, exactly, but it must have been pretty bad for us to miss out on a burger joint like In-N-Out!  I blew into Scottsdale with my mother recently, and she insisted that the first thing in my mouth absolutely HAD to be an In-N-Out burger.  She wasn't wrong.  I'm a little sad, thinking that I'll have to say goodbye to such fresh, glorious burgers when I head back to Atlanta for school.  The Big Mac WISHES it could be a Double Double.   The fries aren't that great--then again, I haven't tried Animal Style yet--but the burgers are more than meat enough for me. ;3"}
{"text":"We could not go to the West Coast without trying In-N-Out Burger. We got the Double Double, Fries (Animal Style), and not featured the Cheeseburger Protein Style (which replaced the buns with lettuce). Overall the burgers were typical American style and we were underwhelmed by the fries. Our friend advised us to ask for it to be overcooked for it to be crispy. The Animal Style was tasty with melted cheddar, grilled onions, and their special sauce with pickles. Worth a visit since a Double Double Combo is $6.85 USD and a Cheeseburger $2.50 USD."}
{"text":"Only been to a handful of locations before. This one seems to be really good. Friendly staff and really fresh food. They make an incredible protein style here. Crisp ice burg and fresh veggies. Do yourself a favor and order inside to avoid the drive thru line."}
{"text":"I love me a good burger. And man, when I heard about this place...I knew I HAD to try it. I schooled my fiance on the \"secret menu\" and after three days of staring at the sign out our bedroom window from Thehotel...we finally grabbed a cab and headed over.  This place is heaven. The burgers are cooked to perfection. Juicy, tasty and BIG...the flavor can't be beat. The animal style fries and burgers...I swear, I'm going to start drooling just thinking about it! The prices are freakin' amazing......Five Guys has now been ruined for me in every way.  In N Out....how I wish you would come to the East!"}
{"text":"It's In-N-Out Burger. It's amazing!! Only giving a four to this place because they took forever to get my order and it was only one burger with fries. The staff was a little bit of a mess and they ended up losing your receipts to about four orders, one of which being mine, so it took extra long.   Everytime I'm in an area that has an in and out I have to try and hit it up. Never disappointed with the food. You have to order animal style, and put it on everything! It's definitely indulgent but completely worth every single calorie!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Can't come to Vegas & not come here!!!!"}
{"text":"I will update my review slightly w/2 stars. My service last night was MUCH better than my last experience I Yelped about. I knew it would be a good night because the line was long and there was a decent wait.  I equated that to fresh food being prepared! I ordered 2 fries and a dbl dbl no cheese, pickle/onion/mustard only. FRESH AND HOT!!! My burger was the bomb, the fries were fresh, but somehow they always taste stale or old. Service was also done w/a pleasant smile this evening. Glad I gave them another chance tonight because they're closest to us & I refused to go to this location. I'd always go on Craig Rd. Instead."}
{"text":"Leaving the airport & starving we stopped here. The drive thru line was a mile long!!!! So we went in to order. The inside line moved fairly quickly. I got my usual dbl dbl pickle/onion/mustard/well done. My food came out quickly. Service was ok. Not a bad location to try."}
{"text":"I don't know, it seems like every time I come to this chain the last 2-3xs my food hasn't been thrilling. Like I could really bypass visiting here on my Vegas trips. This location wasn't any different. Good service. Tables weren't clean. Ordered a double double no cheese, mustard/pickle/onion & fries; food was just OK. Fries were hot, but seemed stale/old. Burger was a notch above McDonald's. WTF!!!!!! It'll be awhile before I come back to any of them."}
{"text":"It's an In-N-Out, and that's all there is to say. It's great taste for a pretty affordable price. Potato fries and burgers are both amazing and the self-service pink lemonade is worth a try if you are discovering it.   For the location, being slightly off the strip and given the low price, it does attract quite a lot special characters from the Las Vegas underbelly as well as Uber/Lyft and taxi drivers. Wouldn't be a place I would recommend if you want to keep the impression of Las Vegas glamour and glitz intact, but would definitely be one I would visit if you want to see a bit more of the behind-the-scenes Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The famous and delicious In-N-Out Burger! What more can I say about this place? Good food, good service and a good place to go hang out on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"I stopped eating hamburger meat a little over a year ago. I really miss cheeseburgers.   Q: What's a girl to do?? A: Go to In-N-Out, and order a 'grilled cheese, animal style'.   I just found out that you can basically get a cheeseburger without the beef patty. It comes with lettuce and tomato,(in my version, they held the lettuce) 2 slices o' cheese, grilled onions, slathered in their awesome sauce.  Yay! It really tastes like the cheeseburgers I remember.    If that sounds good to you, you can order 'animal style' fries, they come loaded with cheese, onions and the sauce.  Freakin' delicious."}
{"text":"It's not the best hamburger you'll ever have in your life, but it is very good, especially for a fast food burger. It's cheap. It's pretty fast, depending on the crowd. Service is good. It has to be eaten immediately or else the fries are soggy."}
{"text":"I was hungry and it's late and I wanted a hamburger.  I thought I've never actually had an in-N-out Burger so let's try one.  Well it wasn't fast my order was taken at 9:20 and at 9:34 my number was called the subsequent 5 orders all came out over the next five minutes...hmmm? Since I've never had a burger from here My impression was they served the best burgers around so I thought well a lot type extra time for a great burger...right?  Nope the patty was thinner than a Micky D's and on top of that is was pink in the middle!  I didn't think it was possible to cook a patty so thin and still have put k in the middle.  Normally I do t eat burgers especially ones from fast food restaurants with pink in them but tonight I was too damn hungry to care!  Not impressed with the service or the burger.  The fries were stellar!! That's how you get a three star effort for that weak sauce performance!"}
{"text":"My favorite location in town (also closest to me!). A great place for a low carb! Those burgers are still so great wrapped in lettuce! I've never waited long and they always get my order right. I'm always pleased leaving this location."}
{"text":"I wish In and Out was in the northeast but I'm willing to travel out west to get my fix of In and Out. When in Vegas most people are excited to see the lights, not me, I can't stop talking about going to In and Out. The burgers are awesome, the service is amazing and the secret menu is a fun added bonus."}
{"text":"I mean, In N Out never seems to disappoint. Let's be real. Their burgers are probably the best ever, fries always hot n fresh, Etc. This review is for the Ray Rd location and specifically a manager there named Eloy. So, I went there last night late-night style, paid with a $20, but forgot to grab my change (or they forgot to hand it back) - either way, just a slip of mind on both ends. Today I was kinda scratching my head, wondering if I was crazy... Searched around, no $14 in sight. So I call, I'm connected to just a customer service hotline. The girl calls the store directly, they say that their drawer was not over and that \"sorry, hope it turns up.\" In all fairness I was calling at 12pm, probably one of, if not the, busiest times of day there, I would imagine. So I start to accept the fate that, \"oh well, it's $14. Maybe I should carry on with my day and not worry about it.\" But then, less than 5 minutes later, I receive a call from Eloy at the store. He kindly explains that what ever money is extra at the end of the day goes into a donation fund, which in and of itself is pretty cool. (I'm not entirely sure where that money is donated, I probably should've asked, but at least I now know that my money wasn't just pocketed by an employee. Right?) He explains that he has it and I can come get it that day, also offering to have me eat lunch there as well. I go in, he shows me the $14 on a slip that says donation for that day, is so kind and polite, and just seems sincerely genuine in explaining that his employees didn't just pocket the money or anything sketchy like that. Anyway, I just was reminded again how awesome In N Out's people are. Rock on, Eloy! The world needs more honest folks like you."}
{"text":"I love all in and out burgers! Friendly staff, good food, and clean! Fast drive thru. Stapley location has a hard parking lot to get they during busy hours but close to home."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and FAST service with good food.  A double-double animal style is a must have."}
{"text":"Always a busy spot.  The food is good but I don't love the fries.  The pink lemonade is to die for! We always go here so we can hit the gift shop for t-shirts.  Sometimes you can get really good clearance stuff."}
{"text":"One of the better In-N-Out locations.  They've always gotten my order right.  Fries are always fresh.  Burgers tasty.  What more can be said.  Animal Style is the only way to go.  I love that they never use frozen food.  Everything is fresh.  Oh you can get a better burger, but not for the price.  In-N-Out employees are the happiest in the fast food industry !!"}
{"text":"OK the perfect IN and OUT dinner requires stratagy, two cars and perfect timing. First send Car A. to in&out to get your dd animal style, dd protein style and your shakes. Once Car A. is in second position in the drive thru, Car B approachs the drive through at Mc Donalds and orders 2 large fry no salt of course so they are hot as possible. Then race home and gorge on the best burger, fry, shake combo available to man(through a fast food zone)!"}

The drive-thru was busy, but empty inside. I love me some In-N-Out, I got nothing to hide.  It's all beef, baby! you won't find pork. I took pictures of my food, and even my fork.   Consistency they have, and freshness they got. I love me some In-N-Out, I'm at one a lot.   Tons of employees working, it was staffed galore. The restaurant was spotless, and even the floor.   As for the price,  it's discount heaven. I got three Flying Dutchman's, for less than seven.   A combo is hooked up,  you do get plenty.  Even a meal for three, is less than twenty.  So, there you have it, I'm a man with a plan. I'm more than just a supporter, I'm a super fan!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out Burger - Las Vegas (215 & S. Eastern Ave.)  Majority of my reviews for In-N-Out are 4 stars.  It's tough to argue with the fact that In-N-Out is affordable and very, very consistent.  However, this location is not ideal for me.  The lines are always long in/out and the drive-thru may possibly be the worst in Vegas.  It's not In-N-Out's fault.  The parking lot at this In-N-Out is not set up to handle a long line of cars at the drive thru.  There is so many restaurants off Eastern Avenue.  There is so many other burger options out here too.  But the craving is real.  There is no resisting a couple of Flying Dutchman's or a Double Double (spread only & extra toast).  There is no resisting it.  The End!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out Burger - Las Vegas, NV (Nellis & Charleston)  I really won't go out of my way to eat at an In-N-Out.  I don't have to.  Regardless where I'm at in Las Vegas, there's an In-N-Out within 5 miles.  But I did go out of my way to hit up this location. Why?  Well, this is the only In-N-Out in Las Vegas that I have yet to eat at until now.  In-N-Out Nellis/Charleston is no joke.  Just driving to the location is an adventure. If you're familiar with the area, then you know that a lot goes down in this area at night.  A lot of activity even happens during the day.  There's also a lot of construction and traffic on the way here.  So, don't expect a quick and painless trip to this In-N-Out.   Like most of the locations out here, this one is busy. The drive-thru line is long and it's packed inside.  I kept my meal really simple.  I got two Flying Dutchman's and two cups of water.  A Flying Dutchman is two patties and two slices of cheese.  A Dutchman doesn't a bun, lettuce, or tomatoes. This is Keto all the way with high protein and crazy high fat.  I eat this meal a lot and wasn't too impressed with what I got. Both Dutchman's were smaller than normal and on the dry side.  This has never happened to me at an In-N-Out.  Oh well, I only came here because I haven't been here before.  I'm still a fan.  I'm just not a huge fan of this location. By the way, this In-N-Out has a great view of French Mountain and Sunrise Mountain.  Bookmark Checked!!!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out (Tropicana & Tee Pee)  Double Double Spread Only & Extra Toast!  My Favorite!  3 x 3 Spread Only & Extra Toast!! YOLO Life!!  Two Flying Dutchman's!!!  Where else can you get 60 grams of protein for less than $4.80?  I agree with all the 4 and 5-star reviews for this In-N-Out.  And Yes, you're getting another In-N-Out review from me.  I've been to every single In-N-Out in Las Vegas. I reviewed all of them, except the location off Maryland Parkway.  Don't worry, that one is coming soon.  I do have my favorite locations and this is not one of them.  This is one of those locations that I will avoid only because it's always busy, out of the way, and the parking lot is crazy.  The restaurant is clean and the staff is efficient.  You can tell who is familiar with this In-N-Out and who isn't.  The rookies will park close to the entrance thinking that they found a great parking spot only to be blocked by the cars in the drive-thru line.  I counted 27 cars ahead of me the last time I was here.  That's crazy!  That's a lot of In-N-Out fans.  Overall, I'm one of them.  You can't go wrong with In-N-Out.  In-N-Out is delicious, cheap, and consistent."}
{"text":"10 Reasons Why I'm a Fan of In-N-Out  1.  Their burgers are always fresh with no preservatives  2.  The menu is basic....Hamburger, Cheeseburger, Double Double, and Fries  3.  A Double Double, Spread Only, and Extra Toast. Nuff Said!  4.  Price is as good as it gets.  A Double Double (2 cheese / 2 patties) is less than $4.00.  The Double Double meal is less than $7.00.  A full meal is about the price of one Cold Brew.    5.  The Service.  They're so efficient.  Food is ordered and served with the quickness  6.  Their Secret Menu.  My favorite \"off the menu\" item is their Flying Dutchman (2 patties / 2 slices of cheese / No Bun), a 3 x 3 (3 patties / 3 slices of cheese), and Well Done Fries  7.  Low Carb or Keto Friendly.  Cutting your carbs and increasing your fat intake?  For less than $5, Two Flying Dutchman's will do the trick. They're even Vegan friendly. They'll say \"hi\" to them.   8.  Pet Friendly.  Fido will thank you for the Pup Patty.    9.  The beef comes from the happy cows of California.  In order to guarantee freshness, In-N-Out is only on the West Coast.  No freezers here.  10. That's What a Hamburger's All About  2017 In-N-Out Review #6 / 2017 Yelp Review #55"}
{"text":"I still remember my first In-N-Out experience, about 10 years ago. It was not this location, but one near Huntington Beach, CA. My boyfriend at the time (who is now my husband) insisted I experience the joy that is a cheeseburger from In-N-Out. We must have passed a half dozen McDonalds, Burger Kings are other fast food burger joints on our way there, but he assured me that it would be worth it. And wow, was he ever right.  What makes In-N-Out better then other fast food burger places? It's all about quality! Nothing is frozen, you can usually see an employee chopping up potatoes for fries, and milkshakes are made with real ice cream.    Now that I live in Las Vegas, this is the In-N-Out I frequent most. I work near the Dean Martin location but due to the proximity to the Strip that place is usually a zoo. The menu is basic. No chicken, no salads, nothing but burgers, fries and some killer milk shakes.   In-N-Out virgins should note that there is a secret menu which can be found here:  http://www.in-n-out.com/secretmenu.asp  My In-N-Out meal of choice is an animal style cheeseburger, fries and a chocolate shake. Animal style means you are getting pickles and grilled onions.   This In-N-Out location is the best I have ever eaten at, and I have been to In & Outs in California, Arizona and here in Vegas. The employees here are always fast and our order is always perfect."}
{"text":"I really can't believe that I have not reviewed this In-N-Out.    I will try to avoid this In-N-Out because the lines are always long.  Besides, I have an In-N-Out less than a mile from my house.  The food is still good at this location and I highly recommend their Double Double, with extra spread, and extra toast.  It's less than $5 and bargain.  My recent meals at this In-N-Out have been two Flying Dutchman's (4 patties / 4 slices of cheese).  It's so good that I can eat 10 of these.  This In-N-Out is located next door to a Cracker Barrel.  I will even see peeps leave the Cracker Barrel and head to In-N-Out.    2017 In-N-Out Review #10"}
{"text":"I still prefer my In-N-Out, which is closer to home.  I'm at this location at least once a month normally around lunch time.  This location is conveniently located off Sunset right off the freeway.  Entrance to this In-N-Out can be a challenge if you miss the left turn from Marks right before the Red Lobster.  I'm not the only fan of this In-N-Out.  The drive thru lines can get a little long at times, but I have yet to have wait longer than 10 minutes for my food.  I love the staff here. I've been here so many times in the last two months that the staff is beginning to recognize me. My order is simple...2 Flying Dutchman's, 2 waters, 1 spread, and 1 fork.  In-N-Out is still my go-to fast food burger.  See you soon!!  2017 In-N-Out Review #2 / 2017 Yelp Review #19"}
{"text":"Had what I call \"Burger Weekend\".  Haven't had a fast food burger in a couple of months. So, I made up for it by having a burger Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  This was my Sunday treat.  Let me start by saying that I frequent IN-N-Out in Vegas and in California. I'm eating at one at least once a month.  My usual is a total of 3 Flying Dutchman's.  A Flying Dutchman is two patties with two pieces of cheese. That's it.  I carb load (3 days carbs kept to only 100 grams, followed by 1 day about 400 grams of carbs).  On my \"No Carb\" days, 3 Flying Dutchman's hit the spot. Only about $6 for 90 grams of protein.  Can't beat that!!!  Now for my recent order: -Double Double:  Spread Only / Extra Toasted -Cheeseburger:  Same Way -Fries  Since it's been awhile since I had a burger.  This truly hit the spot.  IN-N-Out burgers are a bit small, so I always have to order 2 burgers.  Patties are small, but always fresh.    Out of all the IN-N-Outs in Vegas, this one is probably the easiest and quickest.  Anyone been to the one on Craig and 15, they are the longest wait.  This location is in a not so busy shopping center.  Service is good and scary that they even know what I plan on ordering sometimes.    TIP:  Most know about their secret menu (i.e. Flying Dutchman, Animal Fries, Neopolitan, etc).  You can get the full secret menu online.  I remember back in the day, before the internet, when you only got the secret stuff by word of mouth."}
{"text":"On the way to an afternoon conference with a coworker, we decided to make a convenient turn into the parking lot of In-N-Out to grab a quick bite (he had never had In-N-Out and I couldn't let him leave without trying it). We each got our burgers (animal style) and fries, sat down, and devoured everything.   I'm not a fast food kinda gal, and I never order burgers anywhere- unless they are known for them- these burgers are some of the best! Everything is homemade here, down the the hand cut fries, so don't expect to get your food before the blink of an eye (like you might at the golden arches).   Learn from others and order the burger animal style (grilled onions, special spread, etc.) or protein style (lettuce instead of a bun)!"}
{"text":"Ann Arbor is pretty much one that consistent fast food joints that it's the same wherever you go iv ate in Austin Texas, I I've ate it in California and I ate Las Vegas. Restaurants pretty clean people are nice and friendly and food comes just in time always a favorite for me being from the West Coast."}
{"text":"The Flying Dutchman @ IN-N-Out  Suns out, buns out, Lets make this fun. It's basically a Double Double, just minus the bun.  I enjoy the Dutchman, First name Flying. I could eat 2 of these, without even trying.  Its become my go-to meal, as if you didn't know. It's great if you're on a diet, it's no carbs, it's Keto.  I want one now, Make it two, please. That's four patties, with four slices of cheese.  What's the price for one? It's less than three. That's dirt cheap, it's almost free.   This location is busy, there's line, there's a wait. But here's a positive, they stay open late.   I can't wait for lunch, I may even get three. It's great for protein, and Dem Gainz with a Z."}
{"text":"It's official.  I have reviewed every In-N-Out in Las Vegas or Henderson.  In-N-Out is what a hamburgers all about.  It doesn't get any better than this.

Believe...when I say. I want it that way.  Just cheese...and no bun...no carbs!, Can't reach to...your heart. When you say, I want it that way. Tell me why, Ain't nothin' but the patty. Tell me why, Ain't nothin' but the meat and cheese, tell me why. You'll almost always hear me say, I want it that way.   Now I can see that the bun is apart. From the way that it used to be...yeah-eh. No matter locations. I want you to know, That deep down inside of me.  You are...my burger The one...desire You are...You are, you are, you are, Don't want to hear you, Ain't nothin' but the patty. Ain't nothin' but meat and cheese. You'll almost always hear me say, I want it that way. 'Cause I...want it...that way."}
{"text":"It's official.  In-N-Out Burger is at the LINQ.  This is also our first In-N-Out on the strip. This was news months ago and the predication was that this location is going to be the busiest In-N-Out ever.  I don't know about that.  The Barstow CA and Tropicana NV location is pretty crazy.    The girlfriend alerted me that this In-N-Out grand opened today and I couldn't resist. I've been to every In-N-Out in Las Vegas/Henderson and wasn't missing a chance at this one, especially since it was the middle of the week. I'm assuming that the lines during the weekends will be cray cray.  There was a line when I arrived, but it's In-N-Out and goes by so quick.  I found one seat open and took it.  I don't know if it's temporary due to grand opening week, but my meal was served to me.  I prefer a Double Double, spread only, extra toast, and well done fries.  But on this visit, I kept it Keto style with two Flying Dutchman's (Two Patties/Two Cheese x 2). Of course I had spread added (awesome sauce!!).  Both Flying Dutchman's were too salty for my liking.  In-N-Out is known for throwing a lot of salt on their patties, but mine was a little too much.  I'll give them a pass since they're new.    This is not your typical In-N-Out.  For one, there's obviously no drive thru.  And two, the prices are bumped up a bit.  For example, a Double Double is normally $3.60.  Here it's $4.35.  Two Flying Dutchman's usually cost me $4.76.  With a drink, I spent close to $9.00.  A Double Double Meal aka a Number 1 is about $1.50 more.  You get the point. The upcharge is due to location and rent must be exceptionally high.  I get it, I just don't agree with it.  This location is not going to be crazy, it's going to be Karazy.  I'm sure they'll make enough to cover expenses.  In my opinion, locals should get a discount.   Overall, I'm a huge fan of In-N-Out.  I just don't see myself going out of the way to eat here.  But if I am at the LINQ and in need of a good burger, then you know where to find me.   TIP #1:  Don't forget about the secret menu.  Animal Style!! TIP #2:  This location has a Company Store. It's small but good to know.   TIP#3: Expect tons of tourist here.  It was cool to watch excited customers walking in and out.  I even witnessed a few hi-fives and cheering.  Poor things...we are so privileged out on the west.    2017 In-N-Out Review #4 / 2017 Yelp Review #31 / In-N-Out Visit This Week #3"}
{"text":"I have a goal this year to write at least ten In-N-Out reviews in 2017.  Here is In-N-Out review number one.   I've been to this location a handful of times.  It's conveniently located by one of my offices.  It's so close that I could smell the Animal Fries from across the parking lot.  I think that I would be here a lot more, but it's so damn busy.  The drive thru lines are long.  The lines inside is even longer.  A typical order for me is a Double Double (spread only & extra toast), with fries, and an extra Cheeseburger (also with spread only & extra toast).  Lately, I've been sticking to just two Flying Dutchman's (4 patties / 4 cheese).  Overall, I can't complain.  The lines may be long, but always worth it.

{"text":"For my 100th review of 2017, I'm reviewing In-N-Out.  I think it's fitting since I have In-N-Out at least once a week.  I was told by the staff that this is the busiest In-N-Out in the nation.  The staff really didn't need to tell me this.  It's obvious when you come here. The drive thru and lines inside are both always long.  There's people everywhere and I mean everywhere.  Getting a seat inside the restaurant is rare.  You will see a lot people eating outside, on the curb, in their cars, and even at the In-N-Out Company Store. This location is actually not the last In-N-Out before you head to California, but it is the closest to the start of the Las Vegas Strip and airport.  This is the reason why it's so packed.  Plus, a lot of people love In-N-Out. A lot of out-of-towners can't get enough of it. The staff at this In-N-Out is very prepared for the madness.  They're all well-trained and manage to handle the volume of people with efficiency.   I recently ate here just because it's been a long time.  Last week was actually the first time I ate here as a Yelper.  I went with the usual, which is two Flying Dutchman's with Spread.  My meal was as good as it was the previous week.  I've had their Double Double, 3x3, Animal Fries, and a Grilled Cheese at this location back in the day.  That was a while back, though.   This In-N-Out used to be the fun one to go to. I say \"used to be\" only because they no longer create the fun burgers.  The first 100 x 100 that I have seen was at this In-N-Out.  The first Monkey Style Burger that I have seen was also at this In-N-Out.  My understanding is that they will not make both these burgers anymore or they were never allowed to.  It doesn't matter if they don't make these burgers anymore.  In-N-Out has a fan for life.  I'll see you soon, In-N-Out.  2017 In-N-Out Review #8 / 2017 Yelp Review #100"}
{"text":"I'm on a mission to have every In-N-Out in Las Vegas reviewed by the end of this year. That shouldn't be a problem since I eat at In-N-Out at least once a week.  My favorite is their Double Double, Spread Only, and Extra Toast.  It really doesn't get any better than this and it's less than $4.00.  I'll make it a 3x3 if I'm a little hungry.  Obviously, I'm a huge fan of In-N-Out.  Recently, I've been sticking to just two Flying Dutchman's (2 patties & 2 slices of cheese only) to keep the starches low.  In my opinion, In-N-Out is one of the most consistent fast food joints out there. All that being said, I don't avoid too many In-N-Outs, but I do avoid this one.  The lines inside isn't too long, but it seems to take them a little longer to cook just two patties and cheese.  The drive thru lines always seem to be long and snakes through the parking lot.  Most locations will have a staff member taking your order before you get to the window to speed up the process when it gets busy.  This location doesn't do that, at least they didn't the last 3 times I've been here.  Then there's the cleanliness of the restaurant. I'm spoiled that I live very close to the cleanest and least busy In-N-Out in Las Vegas.  My In-N-Out is always spotless.  This location was a little behind on cleaning up a few tables the last 2 times I've been here.  Overall, I'm a huge fan of In-N-Out.  I'm just not a huge fan of this location. Regardless, I'm sure that I will be back to this location at some point. I just never know when I will have those In-N-Out cravings.   2017 In-N-Out Review #9"}
{"text":"As an east sider, I was really excited to try In-n-Out Burger. The menu was simple yet complicated because I wanted to order EVERYTHING.   I tried the cheeseburger with all the fixings. I was a little disappointed by the thin beef patty and immediately regretted not ordering the double double.  The sauce is great though.I also had the fries, which were good but I also tried a friend's animal style fries and those were amazing!  I would definitely visit again and get the double with animal style fries. I do wish they would expand to the east coast."}
{"text":"Good place for a casual lunch or brunch! Hands down I give this place an easy four stars. They serve quality good at a fair price."}
{"text":"I'm really annoyed, I eat here probably 4 times a week because it's the only thing open when when I get off, so I always order a animal fry with the cheese melted on the grill, instead if in the microwave thing, because it taste so much better, and I've done this for months at every in n out, and honestly, its the reason I keep coming back, but for what ever reason the guy that was doing my order said he wouldn't make it that way for me. I spend a lot of money here and like my food cooked to the way I like it, I don't understand why it's it's a big deal, they melt cheese on burgers all day, what's the difference of melting it on onions for my frys. I had them make my animal fry anyway, the normal way and it was done with old soggy frys. Which I'm positive was done on purpose... I think I'll find a new place to go from now on, when I get off work. I'm sure plenty of other places want my business and will not be rude to me... like this guy was, he could have handled it so much better than he did, maybe he's having a bad day but I'm very upset I wish I got his name I'll be calling corporate tomorrow.... I do have my receipt hope they can figure it out from there...."}

{"text":"I absolutely LOVE In-N-Out burger! As someone not a particular fan of burgers, this is pretty much the only spot I go to and am always happy with a burger. Probably for the fact that their burger patties are thin and don't overpower the rest of the ingredients that make up a burger here.   This was my first time coming to this location and I came at opening. There were only one two other people ahead of me in line, so I was able to order quickly and only waited maybe 5-7 minutes before my food was ready. The guy at the register taking orders was in good spirits. He was efficient and made sure to repeat each order before telling you the total. He made sure to smile and welcome new customers as they entered.   Since I came at opening, everything was clean. From all the table to the drink station and the floors. The ketchup was filled as well the drinks and the lemons. Trash was empty and bathrooms clean and stocked.   I ordered the #2 combo which is a cheeseburger with fries and a drink for just over $5. Can't beat that price for what you get, especially since everything was cooked just right and it was fresh and delicious! I love how the fresh veggies are always so crispy here and they don't skimp on them. Unlike places like McDonald's or Burger King, they make sure to give you a whole piece of lettuce, a large slice of tomatoes and a whole slice of onion as well. If you want something taken out or extra they are always willing to accommodate you.  My guest got the #1 combo which is a double-double and made his fries animal style. Only thing I would've changed was to ask for my fries to be extra crispy, but other than that everything was perfect.   I will be back again soon."}
{"text":"One of the must have burgers when we come to the mainland. Not sure if it tastes so much better because we don't have one in Hawaii but the burgers are very delicious. Usually get animal style everything although you should eat the fries quickly or it will get soggy if you do t eat them fast enough. For the amount of burgers people order they are pretty fast. Their milkshakes are pretty good as well. Sorry I didn't post any pictures. I forgot and ate everything before I could take a photo. Next time I'll snap a photo first."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is the Bomb!!   Seeing how I am NOT a big meat person, especially burgers, this place is the only exception to the no burger rule that I'll go to.   Located right off the I-17 and Peoria, this is the ideal spot as it's super easy to find and is easy to get to. There is always plenty of parking if you want to dine in or they have a drive-thru. At times the line for the drive-thru wraps around the building, but people don't seem to care as the staff are quick to deliver their orders.  I always dine-in as I like to get the full experience of In-N-Out. The atmosphere here is friendly, busy and smells AMAZING! I love how when you first get out of your vehicle, you are hit with the amazing aroma of the food! You get inside and are immediately greeted and order is taken by a smiling, friendly face. Ordering is super easy as they have a limited menu. They also are very accommodating when you have a special request, like making your fries extra crispy or wanting extra onions on your burger.   My go to order is the cheeseburger with extra onions and animal style fries. Animal style fries are fries topped with slices of cheese which are melted and then their special sauce is added and topped with grilled onions...delicious.  Burger patty is perfect. Since I don't really like much meat, I love how their patties are thin and cooked perfectly. Lettuce and tomatoes are always crisp and fresh. Onions are slightly grilled, which for me make the burger taste even better. And to tie the whole thing together, they add their special sauce, which I always ask for extra.   Order usually come out within a few minutes, but if you come during rush hours, it can take longer. I however have never waited longer then maybe 7-10 minutes. The staff are very efficient and work hard to get your orders out quickly and correct.  Tables are limited, but usually never have a problem finding a place to sit. Staff are constantly going around picking up trays, wiping down tables and sweeping the floors. If for some reason they are very busy and you see a table that needs cleaning, just let one of the staff know and they are out immediately to clean it. Condiments, drinks and napkins are constantly restocked.   My only complaints is that I wish they made their fries crisper. Even when I ask for extra crispy, it just doesn't seem crispy enough for me. Also, when they make the animal style fries, wish they would use a liquid cheese sauce as the slices of cheese just don't really melt and it doesn't cover all the fries. If you don't eat them immediately, the cheese hardens and then it just isn't all that great anymore. The fries are all stuck together and fall apart when trying to eat them. But these are just minor things to me. I will still continue to come here."}
{"text":"The food quality and customer service here is excellent, and their employees are quite pleasant people, making the visit a far better experience. This place can get very crowded inside, so it's best to come around hours they're typically less busy if you want to be able to find a table.   The main complaint I have with this location is the drive-thru, which can often times take 15-20 minutes to order and receive your food, so I'd highly recommend stopping by and ordering inside if you're on the go."}
{"text":"There is no other In N Out Burger. It is what I consider to be the top of the line in fresh fast food. We live on the East Coast and thus, can only take advantage of this amazing cuisine when we're on the West Coast. Or in Phoenix. Or Las Vegas. In any event, it's amazing. Incredible. Delicious! LOVE IT! In all actuality, I'm kind of glad In N Out Burger isn't over here on the East Coast. Otherwise, I'd be overweight forever! I do need to speak volumes about the staff at this particular In N Out Burger in Tempe. They were fabulous. Bent over backward to please customers. I can't say enough good things about them or the food. Simply fabulous - all the way around!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love In-N-Out Burgers and I'm not even a burger person. This is the only place I'll go for a burger.   Located on Maryland Parkway and Tropicana Ava right by UNLV campus, this location is surely an ideal spot for anyone. The parking lot is really small for all the people that come here though. I guess it's a good thing that a lot of the people that come here are college students and they just walk or bike over to this spot.   I've always just come here at opening for lunch so as to miss most of the lunch rush. By the time I leave though, it's packed.   Their menu is basic, which I like. I always come in here knowing what I want as I always get the same thing. I always get the Cheeseburger combo, that comes with fries and a drink. Sometimes I get my fries \"Animal style\", which is fries topped with grilled onions and special sauce. I always ask for extra onions on my burger as well.   Never have to wait long for my food to come out, maybe 3-5 minutes. I love how you can see how your food is made from the counter, so you always know that your food is actually fresh and made right when you order it. I love how the burger is thin as I'm not a big meat person. I want to be able to taste the other ingredients and not only meat. Fries are always nice and crispy when you get them. You can ask for extra crispy as well.   As for my drink, I always get lemonade. Nothing special about it, but it's still good. I put in extra lemon pieces to make it more tangy.  With as many people that come through here, I am very impressed at how well they keep tables cleaned, trays picked up, napkin holders filled, floors sweep, and overall just keeping everything moving along smoothly.   I'm looking forward to getting back to the West coast so I can get my In-N-out fix."}
{"text":"In N Out's goal is to serve the most delicious burger and fry you can get in a fast casual setting. Serve a tasty sandwich with a smile. They do that at least bi weekly for me at this location. Double Double Animal style light lettuce, cold cheese  Guidelines:  Go here for an affordable sandwich, don't steal soda in your water cup.  Don't waste so many napkins when you dine in Ask for extra napkins in the drive thru.  If you do take your food to go, get the moist components on the side, aka the spread, lettuce, and tomato.  Customer service is accommodating to a fault, they will do whatever you ask within burger reason.  If your food is wrong, tell them. If you're already home, call the number on the receipt, they want to make it right no matter how stupid of a guest complaint or issue you have."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT SERVICE!! In-n-out burger is like an institution. People go here for the simplicity. It is never not busy, it is probably one of the busiest burger joints you'll ever visit, no matter what location/time you decide to go. with all that being said I don't think in-n-out really needs a review for their burgers. This review is for the service I received at about 10:30 tonight from LETTIE GA According to my receipt!! She greeted me outside and took my order because of the long line, I was met with a smile and then when I got to the window Boom she was there too! That shit startled me!Props to Lettie for her attitude and sense of humor about it all! Something about a smile makes mundane encounters more worthwhile!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at In-N-Out Burger before when I was in Las Vegas (required me to drive from my Strip hotel) but this location is the first (and currently only) In-N-Out located on the Strip. It opened somewhat recently (less than 1 month ago). People are always comparing In-N-Out (West Coast) with Shake Shack (East Coast) and now that In-N-Out is located on the Strip, people can enjoy both while strolling on the Strip.  This In-N-Out is located in the Linq Promenade area.  When I went in, I was immediately greeted by people behind the cash register. I wasn't sure what I wanted yet so I didn't line up. After I quickly looked at the items advertised above the cash register and decided to get a double burger combo. The prices seemed higher than \"normal\" but I would assume that it is because it is on the Strip. I asked for the animal style fries (which isn't shown on the menu on the top of the cash register). I was handed a cup so went to the soft drink dispenser to get my drink. I opted for Dr. Pepper since they didn't have the soft drink that I normally prefer which is Coke Zero. After a few minutes, they called out my number and I went to get my tray.  Even though there wasn't much of a line-up to order, the sit-in area was almost completely filled. I managed to get a seat when someone left. Cellphone reception was somewhat spotty inside the restaurant (I'm with T-Mobile) but the restaurant did have free wireless so I was able to update my status of Facebook as well as include pictures of my meal on social media.  When I finished my meal, I went to refill my drink and asked where the washroom/toilette was in the place and one of the employees informed me that there wasn't one inside the restaurant and I had to either go inside the casino or go to the public washroom within the Linq Promenade. Not knowing where the public washroom is within the Linq Promenade was located, I opted to walk to the casino to use the washroom and wash my hands since my burger was messy (but delicious).  Them not having a washroom inside the restaurant and their prices being higher than \"normal\" are the reasons why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 stars."}
{"text":"I can't recommend this place enough! Any time I'm traveling, this is my always reliable place to eat. All across the board, facilities are nice, the customer service is exceptional, and the food is like no other.   Be sure to check out the \"secret menu\" and discover the mouth happiness that is Animal Style. Always a favorite in my book!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this west coast burger joint after hearing about it in The Big Lebowski about 50 times. Yeah, that's how much I love that movie, and no, I'm not a pot head. Anyways, this place has a pretty cool old fashioned, very simple concept without a ton of frills and extras on the menu. The burger is pretty good. Just a very thin but very flavorful patty with lots of lettuce, tomato and onion. You feel like your eating a beefy burger because of all the flavor, but it's really not that much meat. The fries are your basic thin cut fries and they're pretty good and crispy when hot but get nasty pretty quickly if you don't eat them right away. I would definitely recommend stopping by if you are nearby and live in a town without one. I'm glad I did."}
{"text":"Double doubles make me cream in my pants. Oh how I love you. I miss you!"}
{"text":"Flippin' amazing! Double double Animal style is amazing, fries are just ok. They also have a gift shop with in-n-out blankets!!  My only regret is not buying a few little buddies for my plane ride (and the next day)."}
{"text":"Just tried this place a few months back.... had no clue you could order the burgers different ways.  Now... I'm good to go! LOL  Give them a try if you haven't been... the fires are cut fresh... the staff are friendly... it's a good burger... of course... animal style!   Hatch"}
{"text":"Went to this In-N-Out because we like In-n-Out.  Ordered our burgers and they weren't completely cooked.  The replaced them, and the second ones were better...but undercooked burgers aren't good.  The centers were RAW!"}
{"text":"This location always has the freshest fries! Been here many times and orders are always perfect and the staff is always friendly :) My favorite in and out in the Valley!"}
{"text":"This location is always friendly and always gets it right! (Except they don't seem to understand when you want both raw onions and whole grilled onions on the same burger :P)  Often come here and order 6 burgers 6 different ways and have never had an issue. No matter how packed the drive thru is, it never seems to take nearly as long as I think it will! Plus, the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Very good burger and the staff really seems to handle the chaos of a tremendous lunch crowd very well. Double double was the \"go to\" for me and my three sons.   Two of my sons who worked at Ted's Hot Dog's in Buffalo which charbroils their burgers feel that Shake Shack and Ted's have better burgers. They were impressed with the freshness of the beef in their double doubles.  Overall, a very good tasting burger served fast by well trained and courteous employees."}
{"text":"There is, quite literally, nothing original I have to literarily add to the conversation on In N Out.  This West Coast Giant of Burger Making Greatness is, to me and most others, the king of the fast burger restaurant demographic anywhere on planet Earth.  Yes, even including Zimbabwe.    Delicious, simple, delicious, fresh, delicious, messy, delicious and addictive.  And delicious.  It makes me wish I lived in a city with In N Out and grateful to Holy God that I DON'T live in a city with In N Out all at the same time.    The meat, buns, cheese, sauce and veggies (lookin' at you, Animal Style!), and even the tightly-wrapped package, are all exactly what a quick, good burger should be be.  For the record, I'm a 3x3-Animal-style man, no fries, vanilla shake.    This is our one-and-only \"must-do\" on our annual trip to Sin City.  One.  And only.  And we walk for it - about 30 minutes both ways.  And then wait in a crazy long, around-the-restaurant-and-out-the-door line.  It's all worth it.  To In N Out: if you ever move to the Midwest and change your current franchising policy, I will offer you my first-born child and left arm to be allowed to own and operate one of these Bent-Yellow-Arrow joints."}
{"text":"We waited 10 minutes for our food. We ordered 2 chocolate shakes. Twice. Never got them. Let them know and were still charged for it. The guy (emilio or emelio) left during the middle of making the first one. He was very sloppy and confused. Speaking of sloppy, thanks for the terribly thrown together animal style fries. 12Am. Midnight. Is when we went."}
{"text":"Is there anything bad anyone could even say to this place? It's perfection. Always comes out the way you want it. Fresh to order. Great staff, always kind. I come here with my friend all the time after the gym to get all kinds of gainsssss."}
{"text":"Normally this place is great but today we waited 15 minutes for our food and it was bland and not hot.  Because its normally delicious we will be back but hopefully the wait time is shortened...this is fast food!"}
{"text":"One of the main reasons I love heading out west is In-N-Out Burger. I think about it for days and then...I do it. Burger, fries and a pop were served quickly and correctly. If you've got to eat fast food, this is the one to eat. Can't wait to do it again."}
{"text":"This In-N-Out Burger always has a line out the door.  There is a reason, you get a fantastic burger.  I am glad we don't have one in Indy, or I would be much heaver.  Well done In-N-Out Burger!"}
{"text":"For the money, you won't find better Hangover Food!!   I came here on Jan. 1 and I've never seen a busier In N Out! I saw a LOT of hungover ppl!!! The line was literally out the door, and the drive-thru? pfft, blocking the street. It was too stuffy indoors so I opted for the drive-thru and that lined moved!  After about ten minutes, I got my cheeseburger animal style, animal style fries, 6 ice waters, and vanilla shake and all my troubles seemed to melt away.   Everything was cooked to perfection! This In N Out is on it! They're at the top of their game to handle soooooooooooo many people and still produce such top notch food!   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The guy that took my order(Christian Ni) was so damn dramatic. He messed up my order by adding to sodas to my one combo.he then charged me and I seen that he added 2 extra drinks... I told why are you adding a drinks? He then started slamming the empty cup on the counter and got caty with me and told me \"I asked you and you said yes\". I told him you are trying to be quick and mumbling all fast. Awful customer service. The Manager then came and asked what was going on? He began yo mumble to her she said\"what are you saying\" I explained to her because his incompetent ass was mumbling AGAIN. she then told him well did you verify this with the customer first about the drinks he then kissed ass and said \"oh it's my fault it's my fault\" I messed up\" I didn't get a sorry from him. That right their proves that he should never ever work in Customs service. A lot of ppl wish they can work there and he's just pissing this opportunity away. Steer clear from placing an order with Christian Ni"}
{"text":"The one thing this place has going for it is quality and freshness.  Quality is subjective of course, we are after all talking about fast food, The burgers are good(sauce is very nice).  The secret menu has some interesting things on it that I have yet to try, but im looking forward to it. Fries are ok, the malts are horrible, this from somebody who knows malts, born and raised in Wisconsin.  The malts here are too sugary and the flavor is off. 3.4 stars"}
{"text":"Have always like in n out. Good customer service,  the people are always polite, courteous, and friendly to my kids. Will come back since this is usually my kids' favorite place."}
{"text":"I'm in burger heaven! Let me start out by saying this was not my first food choice for today. I wanted a nice brunch....I planned for the Venetian, but it didn't happen for reasons beyond my control. I decided that since we wanted to try In and Out Burger this was as good a time as any.   The very long line moves quickly. I was so surprised. There is a fairly decent wait for the actual food to come out but it's not unbearable.   Now for the food!!! Yummy squared. Since I missed breakfast, I got a double double with fries. The burger was fresh and juicy. Well cooked. Tasty without accompaniment and filling. The fries were super salty, but not so bad if you skipped the ketchup.   The only negative was that sitting outside seems to attract the drunken men and women looking to get over their Saturday hangovers. I never heard so many f bombs in such a short period of time...unless Richard Pryor counts."}
{"text":"Usually when I come here im never disappointed. Food is always amazing, employees are working hard, and my order is always correct! Thai specific time however the boys at the window where I got my food were screwing off and forgot half of my order. Super bummed that I didn't get what I paid for and that I drove a good 20 mins to get it. Hopefully this won't happen again."}
{"text":"This location is on point! I always experience fast service and fresh food.   The employees are also friendly, helpful and always provide curtious and efficient service.   What's the best is that you always get a fresh drop of fries without even having to ask!"}
{"text":"I'm a die hard INO fan. I devoutly believe that INO has achieved what all fast food restaurants should strive for and that is to provide great quality food for a great price. Don't get me wrong, I know there's gourmet burgers out there, ones that (dare I say it?) might taste a lot better, but INO can definitely hold it's own among many other burger option in the valley.   When it comes to this specific location I use the drive through most often than not. I recognize that anytime I decide to to go to INO that there will most likely be a ridiculously long line, but I don't find this to be the restaurants/staff's fault. When you have a good product it only makes sense that it would be in high demand. On busy days/nights INO has an associate out on the lot taking orders so I know they're doing what they can to really get their customers \"in and out\" of there. It goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway incase I haven't made my point obvious, that it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Always a great place! Cheap food too! Everybody should try animal style burgers or fries!"}
{"text":"Always bomb sat outside it's really packed but my kids snagged a table.The wait isn't bad compared to how many people are there and the food was hot and fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"Great hangover food. One downer about this location - its super packed. I would recommend going to the other location near UNLV instead since it's less crowded."}
{"text":"First time at In-and-Out and it was everything I expected. Busy restaurant is it good sign! Burger came out super hot and delicious, animal fries were ok and vanilla shake on point."}
{"text":"I thought I'd give this place another try, um no still icky.  I figured if I go to an IN & Out in a nice area, that's still new the food would be better.  Nope still awful, even though this time I tried a double double animal style.  Hello where is the meat in this thing?  I see onions but where is the taste?  All I could taste was pickles pickles pickles.  Less than five bucks for a burger and an warm iced tea and I feel like I got ripped off.  I really don't understand the hype with IN & Out, the food is just plain garbage."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS place and I've always gone through the drive thru though. Their ideal with making it easy to stay on my Keto diet! I get the Double Double Protein Style no onions. BUUUUTTT I WAS CRUSHED when I went to change my daughter in the bathroom to realize their was NO CHANGING Tables?!?!? Like seriously? This is the 21st Century! With how much money this Amazing place makes you would think they could accommodate people with babies I was truly disappointed. Only reason I didn't give this place 5stars!"}
{"text":"The LONGEST LINES u will ever wait in that's for sure! But hey it's worth it, and they make it go by pretty fast. Great Service, Friendly employees... I def recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I know there are quite a few reviews, and I'm not saying go or don't go.  I just can't seem to figure out the big draw of this place.  I was not impressed...at all.  Meh..for sure."}
{"text":"In n Out is consistent across the board but this location went above and beyond. A month ago we were in the drive thru and the car ahead of us took our order. The young man working in the window was very confused and highly apologetic. He partnered with his supervisor. I was offered a free drink for myself and my daughter. In addition, we had to park in order to keep the line moving. The nice staff brought us our food in a timely manner and continued to apologize. Thank you for an excellent product, professional experience."}
{"text":"honestly, the burger was good, nothing extraordinary- the fries were TERRIBLE, wouldn't go back solely for this reason, for a place so well known and famous you would think they would invest in better fries!"}
{"text":"Mark was very helpful and attentive.  Good food and good staff.  The consistency of good burgers and fries:  9 out of 10 visits are good.  4 out of 10 are above expectation! 1 out of 10 visits is a real disappointment.  Soggy fries, soggy bun, and beef patties that are cooked at a sub temp."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly service, delicious food. Everything that you'd expect from In-n-Out, w/ out the line!  I was very surprised that one a Saturday afternoon this place was practically deserted. We were greeted promptly, by just about the smiliest (thats a word, right?) guy Ive ever met. Our food was out w/in about 5 minutes of us leaving the counter, and of course it was delicious.  A much better choice than the \"new\" food court at Fiesta Mall."}
{"text":"I'm from the east coast, and recently moved to the area.  So I bought into all the hype and the good ratings on Yelp and tried In And Out.  Boy, was I thoroughly disappointed.  I checked out their website before I went and knew what was on their regular menu and their \"not so secret\" menu.   I was ready to order as we pulled up during the dinner hour to a very full drive thru.  It took 10 mins from the time we ordered to the time we got our food.  I was prepared for this and wasn't really an issue for me.    So I get home and unpack my food and get ready to eat.  The fries are very cold, bland and had a lot of burnt fries in the mix.  I just smothered them in ketchup and had them anyway.  Nothing special there.  Now for the burger.  I have never in my life eaten a burger with more than one patty (except for a Big Mac) just because I never need/want that much ground beef on my sandwich.  Well I could have gone 4x4 on this one because these beef patties were the thinnest I have EVER seen from a fast food joint.  They were black, charred, and leather looking on the outside, yet somehow despite the microscopic thinness of the patty were still pink on the inside.  Yuck.  Overall this meal was pretty disgusting and certainly did not live up to its reputation.  I seriously doubt I will ever visit an In and Out chain again."}
{"text":"In-n-out is the west cost king of burgers. Cooked to order fresh and never frozen. I had the double double with grilled onion. If you don't have alot of time on your hands come back another day because you will wait about 10-15 mins for this masterpiece"}
{"text":"THE LEGENDS ARE TRUE.  Sometimes you worry that a place will never live up to the hype.  Like Slumdog Millionaire.  Well, you don't have to worry about that with In-N-Out Burger, because it is what all fast food establishments need to strive for.  It is the best of the best.  Clean restaurant, incredibly good service and staff, and most importantly the best fast food you'll ever find.  There isn't much I can say that is negative about In-N-Out.  I guess the only thing is that it's ALWAYS BUSY.  But the line moves really fast, and that's because the service is really good here.  Having a smiling happy and friendly staff goes a long way.  I just feel like your entire experience could change if you saw a long line and a bunch of miserable employees serving them.  I didn't see that, and I appreciated it.  I even asked for a bumper sticker (and felt bad asking given the rush inside), and the employee never gave me a single notion that he was annoyed about this special request.  He went to the back room and grabbed me two of them without thinking twice about it.    Double double animal style, animal fries, neo shake.  That's how I roll.  The neopolitan shake is so thick that the flavors don't become one odd flavor, you get different flavors in every sip.  The burgers are nice and juicy and everything just works together really well.  I find fries boring, but not when they're covered in grilled onions and \"spread\".    We made a point to eat here twice in a 3 day span.  I rarely eat fast food, but just couldn't help myself.  This particular location IS walkable from the south end of the strip.  Coming from the Trop, it took about 15 minutes.  It's a little tricky to figure out, but google \"walking to in-n-out vegas\" or something like that, and you will find detailed instructions."}
{"text":"I'm far more excited about finding this place on the strip then I should be. I live on the East Coast so I only get to enjoy \"in and out burger\" when I travel for work or visit my left coast friends. It is by far the best fast food anywhere and this new location does not disappoint.   It's a little hard to find because it's way in the back of the courtyard  on the right near the Linq Ferris wheel. Worth the hunt   As is typical with other locations the service is unbelievably friendly and welcoming and surprisingly efficient for the crowd. I had my usual which is the double double burger (they are thin patties if you've never had it before so it's not as big as it sounds) vanilla milkshake and fries.  I was traveling with my boss who had never even heard of in and out burger so this was his first experience. He loved it!  The way that they advertise peeling the potatoes and cutting the fries daily just makes all the difference in the world. So good!!!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed by the quality of food especially when we were taking newbies to In and Out experience. It is a walk if you are staying at places like the Bellagio.   A downside is that inside seating is limited and some people just hang out since there is ac. They do gave blockd off outside seating which is great but not when its 108 degrees outside."}
{"text":"As a Midwesterner, it was a big thrill to finally get a taste of In-N-Out Burger! I got there ten minutes after they opened and that was when the crowd started arriving. I had heard about some of their menu items, but I didn't realize a lot of them were 'hidden'. Hidden as in no animal fries on the menu. They expect people to ask, which I suppose is a good thing. When I go to a chain restaurant for the first time, I usually start with their signature. I got the Double Double Cheeseburger with all available toppings and their animal fries. The looks and the taste was awesome. The fries were something else. While I was there, a birthday party was going on for a college student returning to Phoenix! If you go anytime during the day, definitely allow yourself plenty of time as In-N-Out (any location) is always busy!  I will definitely be back to In-N-Out next time I'm in the West. Its always great to get something which is not available back home. Side note: the co-founder, Esther Snyder, grew up in the tiny town of Sorento, Illinois, which is about 20 miles from me. Kind of makes me wonder why they don't expand to the Midwest?! Oh well..."}
{"text":"My favorite go to place when I'm craving some beef! Always consistent, always consistently great!"}
{"text":"Did you hear of Animal Style?  If you never have, you can thank me later.  I accept cash.  ^_^  I always eat the Double-Double combo with fries, animal style.  Animal style is cheese, bacon and their special sauce.  You can also ask for your burger to be animal style but for me, it's overkill.  So fries can be the animal and my burger can be au natural.    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard In-N-Out - very busy, lots of people, and yummy burgers. Eating outside isn't too bad at night. It's a tad bit warm and will probably be the only spot you'd be able to find since finding available seating inside is almost impossible.  **For out-of-town visitors, there are a lot of cabs here so feel free to take a cab there, since there are plenty available for you to take back to wherever you need to go."}
{"text":"When you don't have access to an In & Out you just appreciate it that much more.   So I might be a little biased but it was still a great burger."}
{"text":"In and Out is life. Wheras, I do not commonly suppport California; however, In and Out might as well be the hand of God. We I go back east no one understand the joy and a 4x4 or animal fries. I am about this lifestyle."}
{"text":"Heard the hype and wanted to check it out.  There is no In-N-Out Burger near me so when this came up, I was game! Got the \"animal special\" which includes grilled onions. Order process was quick, burger preparation was quick, deliciousness was quick! I will admit....it is the best fast food burger I have ever had! It is so simple but so good."}
{"text":"Simple, delish, fast burgers with a veggie option! You cant go wrong with In-N-Out and this one is a great one!  Note to all my veggie lovin friends, get the grilled cheese with whole grilled, its amazeballs. #veggie4life"}
{"text":"Its your run of the mill In-N-Out, with consistent food, service, and speed. I just love In-N-Outs, and this one is a great example of what this restaurant should be like.  Veggie options: grilled cheese with whole grilled onion, do it, its amazing!! Its exactly like a burger, just without the meat. Its a wonderful option for us veggies. #veggielife #veggie4life"}

{"text":"To wax poetic about In-N-Out would probably require at least a novella. Let's just say that It is consistently the best fast food burger that I have had.  I have been to this particular location 10 times if my Yelp check-ins tell the tale. It is just a few minutes from where I live and it is right off the highway as well as near a ton of stores such as Costco and Wal-Mart where people normally buy stuff. It can get reasonably high-traffic at peak hours, but it's not the worst I've seen.  The food is always great. I got my normal order tonight, the double-double animal style with no pickles, and fries lite well. Animal style is a so-called \"secret\" menu option, and when this modifier is applied to a burger, it gives you mustard-cooked beef, pickle (hence my \"no pickle\"), grilled onions instead of , and extra spread (their mix of ketchup, mayo, mustard, and pickle-that-I-like-to-consider-as-relish).  You can apply the animal style modifier to fries too, as I sometimes do. They'll pile a bunch of cheese, grilled onions, and spread on top of an order of fries. It's probably the ultimate pig-out option here. As for the lite well fries that I did order, they leave them in the fryer more than the usual amount of time, but not enough for all the fries to get crunchy and oil-filled. It's a happy medium between that extreme and the relatively limp regular fries.  The burger is a consistent masterpiece. Fluffy bun, beef that tastes just fine in spite of being cooked well-done, fresh tomato and lettuce, melted cheese, grilled onions, and delicious spread. It is easier for me to eat them in the same bite as my fries + ketchup when I'm actually eating in and using the somehow-always-cold ketchup in the paper thimbles. I kinda have this obsession about carefully applying dabs of ketchup to fries from the ketchup packets. I'd recommend eating in for that reason (and for the freshness factor).  Also on the menu are soda (or pink lemonade) and the three standard milkshake flavors on the menu. I feel like I get enough calories and avoid those nowadays, but if you want to treat yourself, mix some pink lemonade with Sprite, or ask for a neapolitan milkshake for all the flavors in one cup.  I've still yet to visit a Shake Shack, but other than that potential matchup, In-N-Out always holds its own against other fast food burger joints that I try. It's not even a true childhood favorite (McDonald's, ahem) since I only started eating there during high school. It's just a favorite, period."}
{"text":"I would go here every day of my life if there was still In-N-Out nearby. It was great to have right by campus, and the employees were always exceptionally pleasant."}
{"text":"TOO EFFIN' CROWDED. Find a different In N Out on your phone and go there instead for better service and less crowds. Otherwise, food is just like any other traditional In N Out which is delish!"}
{"text":"This location used to be really good. The customer service used to be on par and now it lacks. They got our order wrong and we told them twice and they still got it wrong. It's called active listening! The girl that took our order didn't listen to one thing that I said and then she said that she will make sure it's corrected and never followed through with it.  She is just pure laziness.  Maybe next time I will take the drive out to Henderson and actually have an order right The first time you asked for it"}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out. I've been to at least 7 locations including this one. This one is easily the worst (and I'm still giving it three stars).  It's not all because of the huge crowds, although that's part of it. The problem was that the service is shoddy, which should not be the case even at a busy location. On certain travel weekends, Kettleman City, located roughly halfway between the Bay Area and LA, gets pretty darn busy, but they can handle themselves. Here, they call orders prematurely and don't get all the fries ready. I also saw a woman with a serious enough complaint to get a coupon or something from the manager.  The food was good, as you would expect from In-N-Out. Juicy burgers, fresh ingredients, all that jazz. However, unless you're going for the first time novelty of eating at the location with the flashy sign, then pick another location."}
{"text":"Located in the LINQ, this is one of the largest In and Outs I've been to.  The lines were long but processed quickly.  It helps if you know what you want.  There are tables outside but nobody wanted them with temperatures over 100 degrees.  All the tables inside were occupied.  I placed the order while Gabriel stood close to the seating area ready to rush in for a table.  Not sure if the girl taking my order just came in because she was cheery as can be.  Not.  Maybe over whelmed 1st day on the job with the heat and the endless line of customers.  I'm surprised it didn't go out the door.  She took my order with some difficulty because the  noise level was so high. She did confirm my order of a 4x4, dbl dbl and animal fries. I also asked to load them up  with everything especially the fried onions.  I then walked over to the other side of the seating area.  This way we had both sides covered hoping we would get seats soon.  Then It happened.  A table vacated and I swooped in before the last person got out placing my rightful clam on the table.  Gabriel came over sat down while I loaded up on napkins, ketchup and those delicious hot peppers.  I was proud to have this moment with Gabriel, my son.  Having his 1st 4x4 and animal fries.  I wasn't sure if he'd be able to eat it all.  I know I can't that's why I just had a dbl dbl.  Well,  he did finish it all proving he is a carnivore.    Something about the taste of these burgers just keeps everyone coming back.  Clean, pure and feels healthy with the tomatoes and lettuce.  It's how I would make it at home but not as good.  Well, you don't have to go off the strip any more to get your secret menu craving."}
{"text":"In-n-Out burger is hands down the best fast food burger joint!!!  Their burgers are cooked to order, the fries are cut and made constantly.  My food is always fresh and delicious.  They are the most consistent in food quality and freshness.  They pay and hire the best kids.  I have never had a bad experience at any In-n-out Burger and I have eaten at many!!!  Simply the best!!!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out burger is the best.  They are the most consistent hamburger joint ever.  I literally have never had a bad burger!  The employees are always so friendly and helpful.  The restaurant is very clean.  They are always super busy because their product is great.  They have hidden menu items so look it up!!  Animal style is delicious!!  They are also very fast at getting your food out and everything is cooked to order and fresh.  The fries are actually cut by hand and cooked seconds before serving.  Their prices are very reasonable especially for the quality of the meat.  My family loves In-N-Out burger, it's the best!!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally get the chance to taste what everyone had been raving about.. Looking at pictures on all my friends social medias the anticipation when I finally got to in and out was real!! This was the one place I was looking forward to most. So I asked an expect what to order they suggested I get the animal fries with a 3 by 3 just to make the experience an epic one while I'm visiting. Here's the verdict... So the fries were 1. Ice cold which I don't get I see them cranking them out right in front of you 2. tasteless.. Literally like cardboard covered in sauce I couldn't even take another bite.. Finally the burger it looks beautiful!! Again pick it up 1. Ice cold soggy and 2.tasteless just covered in sauce which I know I asked for so its not the sauce I'm complaining about. The bread was just mush and not soaked by the sauce just cold and wet! I took one bite and could not believe what just happened after waiting on the long line for my food and all the anticipation this just happened!!! I was completely heartbroken I had no desire at that point to even get up and have them remake my meal.. I was hungry and beyond aggravated. I don't know what happened I saw them cranking out fresh fries and burgers back there by the minute.. Why my food came out like that was mind blowing. Sorry to say I am not a fan. Guess it was just my luck :("}
{"text":"Love it here so much!! They work at a fast pace and always treat everyone with respect. The lines are crazy long but they move through it quick. Strawberry shakes are the best!"}
{"text":"The burger was very good but, the fries were very meh.  A lot better than the usual fast food drive-through hamburger but, didn't live up to the hype.  Other than the food, the price was right, service was fine, and restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"I love this location! Food is always delicious, warm and just always on point. Co workers are always friendly and its always clean. They are busy 24/7, maybe I wait like 10 minutes but hey the food is always hot and fresh. They gave us a christmas card, which was very sweet of them. It was signed by all who was working that night.  Great customer service and great food. I go here maybe every other week!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Always clean and the service is very fast. Fresh food :-) Always get animal style! My friend had the veggie burger with a lettuce wrap, she loved it. Fries are always fresh!"}
{"text":"We were here during Easter weekend and my fiancé and I both got horribly sick that night and the following day.  We were here a week, so we decided to point the blame elsewhere, and gave it another shot...Fail!! - our son got horribly sick as well immediately after... Conclusion---It WAS In-n-outs not so great burgers that infected our stomachs! Never again"}
{"text":"Good hamburgers but fries were not great .  The sauce is to die for Service is fast and the staff was friendly It a staple when in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"The hype is real!   If you're in Vegas, or the West Coast, you HAVE to stop here! You'll never find anything like it on the East Coast and plus, it's In-N-Out Burger. Who doesn't want to say that they've been here.   The burgers are good. They aren't amazing, but they're better than McDonalds..of course. The fries are why I come here. They are delicious! Freshly cut from real potatoes and fried to a crisp. It's absolutely heaven and my mouth is watering now as I write this review.   You just have to go to understand."}
{"text":"We love In-N-Out! This will be one of those places you can always go and know you are getting 100% quality service everyday every visit. Employees are always constantly very nice and attentive. This location is convenient and clean. Try the peppers if you dare! Will always be a staple."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with an in and or burger, and there really isn't much to say because that all they pretty much have. This location is nice and clean and the staff is great. Only complaint i have was the obnoxiously loud retarded high school kids, and them not having respect for the older folks outside who came to have a nice meal and chat. Poor people had their attention more to them than their actual food."}
{"text":"I reserve my good as it gets for Shake and Shake...The holy grail of burgers! Now if they would just build one in AZ!   I love a good burger and as far as fast food this one is in my top 5 although it is the fresh cut fries that put In & Out in the top for me.   The list is as follows:   1 Steak N Shake: Mustard pickle onion only! No cheese, No tomato lettuce or MAYO UGH. You are ruining it by adding anything but the 1st three condiments. I am a purest.   2 In & Out: Light sauce add onions! Yum Well done French Fries please.   3 Whataburger: I love the A1 thick and hearty burger otherwise it's the double cheese with mustard and onion only.   4 Carls Jr: The superstar does me just fine! This would be my # 3 if they had good fries to go with that flame broiled burger but they have rockin onion rings!   5 Wendy and Burger King: They are in a tie for 5. I love the fresh never frozen burgers from Wendy's but the King had me at flame broiled. Although BK's Fries are NASTY and the onion rings have no onion in them WTF!?   I do enjoy the fresh toppings and delicious fries at In and Out. I also quite like to watch my food being prepared so I know there have been no shenanigan's!   If you really want to treat yourself get a double double with onion of course and then an order of fries well done. I add vinegar to my fries and they are out of this world delicious! Now go eat a burger I'm done talking to you."}
{"text":"oh, come on!  you know i had to get my In-Out-Burger on! i've been feening for this food for too long.  hmm... it's been exactly one year since my last fix.  yeah, i talk about this place like it's Heroin.  people get addicted to it!!!  i don't even like burgers all that much...  but this place will convert you. muahaha.   you don't have to do much to impress a gal like me.  seriously...i can settle with cheap eats. =)   the employees are always sweet and cool... our orders were pretty confusing. they made no mistakes. wow- i miss people being polite to me."}
{"text":"If you've never had a burger from In-N-Out you don't know what you're missing!  In-N-Out excels at what they do because they focus on one thing: burgers and fries. Unlike most fast food places today that are crowded with too many options (which are usually mediocre at best) this chain has perfected the burger and stuck with what they know best.   I always order a double double animal style (extra Thousand Island spread, mustard grilled patties, and extra pickles). I'm not a fan of their fries but when ordered animal style as well (Thousand Island spread, cheese, and grilled onions) they're more than palatable.   This location (like all the others) is always busy regardless of the time of day but the staff does a great job of serving up the food and keeping the dining room clean.  Definitely worth a stop!"}
{"text":"Had the cheeseburger and, ugh, it tasted like mush.  The fries were too salty.  I've been to this joint many times before and enjoyed the food but this time it gave me an upset stomach!!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite fast food burger joint in the country. Nothing compares to a double-double with spread and cheese only for me.   If feeling adventurous, try the animal style fries along with your burger - they're fantastic. If you're still hungry, add a Neapolitan Shake as well (hint they come in larger sizes than advertised on the menu)."}
{"text":"Best burger and fries in my opinion. Very quick and polite service which is the main reason for their name - \"In-N-Out Burger\". The animal sauce is a must try. If you don't eat too much bread (carbs) you can get your burger protein style with lettuce as your bread. \"Awesomeness!!\" Their shakes are supposed to be very good as well but didn't get to try that. Visited the memorabilia shop right next to the restaurant and received complimentary decals from the associate that was on duty. Very cool and just another example of their service levels. Awesome service with great food = 5 stars."}
{"text":"For fast food burgers, in and out is tough to beat. Ask for your burger animal style and you won't be disappointed. Their fries are just so so. The milkshakes are pretty awesome. In and out always hires very nice people, it is rare to get bad service. I recently went to a nutrition seminar and they said a healthier fast food option is in and out, protein style burgers. It's basically a burger wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun!"}
{"text":"I've been here over 100 times and it is the same high quality service and food every time. They have never messed up my order. They never forget a fork. They never forget napkins. Management is very good and they are very quick/efficient. Plus it's in n out. Can't go wrong there but this location in particular is very good."}
{"text":"Fries were barely warm tasted very dry, not fresh  patties were paper thin, In&out has gone WAY down hill.  This was our last effort, never again, just a disappointment every time."}
{"text":"This location is probably the closest I've found to the CA in & out burgers. I know, I know but you wouldn't understand unless you've had it in Cali. In a day and age that Taco Bell has hot dogs, McDonald's sells tacos... I can appreciate their simplistic menu and attention to getting it right. This is more of and personal opinion but I also like that their business structure values a hard worker and makes it worth their employees time to do well."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite In-N-Out locations in the Vegas valley.  I used to frequent this location all the time when I attended UNLV and now normally only go here when I'm on or near the strip.  I much prefer this location over their Tropicana location because the patrons at the Tropicana location are usually drunk and rowdy tourists.  No thanks, I'll drive an extra few minutes to this one for a more enjoyable dining experience.  This location is always spotless and clean, the staff always friendly and fast.     In-N-Out has a small and basic menu, but what they do have on their menu they always do so well.  The burgers I order are always very juicy, the buns always toasted to perfection, fries are always crispy (you can request extra crispy if you are in the mood), milkshakes always the perfect balance of sweetness.  The spread they use on their burgers are on a whole other level and are to die for.  I usually get the #1 meal which is a double-double burger (two patties) I opt to get my burger with the grilled onions on top too.  The meal comes with fries and a drink too all for $7.41 tax included.  If you've never been to In-N-Out before stop what you are doing and come here now.  I will always be a diehard In-N-Out fan through and through!"}
{"text":"i heart the crap out on in and out they have the best burgers and fries.. i even got the wife to admit it was way better that dicks in seattle which is a real bad ina nd out knock off that is in seattle."}
{"text":"Got to say, I was really hoping this would be a little higher ratings as i have heard about how excellent everything is at In-N-Out.  The burger was actually pretty good but just not what i was expecting, maybe too high of hopes?  Anyhow, they were very busy and the staff was most excellent, the food was good, don't get me wrong, enjoyed the fry's and love the simple menu.  I will go back again, maybe when not soo busy, and update the rating if deserved.  All in all, would i recommend, yeah, for sure."}
{"text":"My friends and I ubered from the Las Vegas strip to eat here. The distance is pretty short so the uber ride is pretty cheap. It's about a 7$ uber ride during non prime times. So it's about a 14 dollar uber ride for a round trip. It's definitely worth I ubering the 14 bucks for your 8 dollar meal.   Every time I go to Vegas this is the in n out I hit up. It's the one closet to the Las Vegas strip.  The animal style is always the way to go. It's a secret menu item that has lost its secret menu luster because it's not a very well kept secret. Everyone gets their burgers and fries animal style now and days. It's not on the actual menu so don't look for it on their official menu board. The animal style sauce is almost like a thousand island remix.   For 8 bucks for a whole meal, you can get cheaper eats than that!   Ask for a free bumper sticker. It's not an obnoxious sticker. It's a small sticker that you can stick on your snowboard or roller blades."}
{"text":"Great taste like the others in the chain. Stopped by at 5 in the evening and they had a long line, but it moved quickly.  They had an employee walking alongside the cars to take orders and call them in. By the time I got to the window, I paid, received my food and left. Everything was correct on my order. It was actually quite quick and efficient,  despite the long line."}
{"text":"Cheeseburger: SO GOOD. Fries: not worth it. Wait time: on a Friday night at 9:30 it's bumpin'. Be prepared to wait. Overall: worth it."}
{"text":"I popped my in-n-out cherry at this location and I can't get enough when we go to Vegas. Usually the first stop after we get off the plane is stopping by and grabbing grub. This other location on Paradise Blvd. is less busy, but the food here just taste a little better.  Animal Style!"}
{"text":"Eh. Went here because we do not have this chain in our city and my daughter raved about the chain having eaten at one on a trip. Not sure what the fuss was about. The burger was ok ( ordered animal style)   Nothing special. Have had better at many many other places. The fries were horrible. Dry and tough and tasteless. Much better fries at McDonald's  Even Wendy's or Burger King fries are better. Tried it once. Will not go back."}
{"text":"I know it's a chain. I know it's a fast food burger joint. I know they have a small menu. I know. But damn, is it good. And damn, do they try their hardest to make fast food with quality ingredients. And damn, do they serve the heck out of anyone who walks in their doors with a smile. These four stars come hard-earned."}
{"text":"It lives up to the hype. Amazing burgers fries and shakes!!! I'm jealous of any city that has In and Out burger. I was also amazed of how efficient this place runs, it seemed like there were 1000 people there and we got our food in under 15 minutes."}
{"text":"In & Out never fails on taste, quickness of your order however, is a different story. Sometimes you can get it within 2 minutes, sometimes 10. Aside from their timing, I've never got a wrong order or an order thats anything less of delicious. I usually get a cheeseburger with onions and tomato and animal style fries with a pink lemonade."}
{"text":"This location is right next to UNLV and is usually busy. I was surprised today that this location was quite dead. I guess everyone was barbecuing at home since it was the 4th of July.   Ordered the cheeseburger combo with fries and drink. The burger was quite good, all the ingredients were fresh and the fries were piping hot out of the fryer and yummy.   The only con about In and Out is it seems like the patties have gotten thinner over the past years.  I guess you can't really compare them to the gourmet burger joints where your paying $10 to $15 just for a burger.  Overall, good service and decent quality for a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Aaron took my drive thru order on 9/18 at 8:10pm and he needs a broadcasting job or a spot on talk radio or some kind of announcing job cuz his voice is unreal."}
{"text":"What can you say about In-N-Out that you do not already know?  Sober, drunk, high, tired, hungry, late night, date night, cheap life, secret menu.... It is always there for you."}
{"text":"For your money you get consistency, freshness and great quality service always in a reasonable amount of time. They run a good business and they serve only fresh, hot food."}
{"text":"I can't imagine a better restaurant value anywhere. Not to mention that I don't get the post fast food hangover after pigging out on 2x double double and fries. Yum yum. Under $10? It's ridiculous."}
{"text":"Shocking location; Very thankful for it's upcoming. Two double doubles with onions a ordered of fries and a Dr.Pepper."}
{"text":"Love this location. Around and down the street from my work and home commute. What should you order? A left from Walmart and McDonalds; \"It's a lovely night for a true 'American'\""}
{"text":"Place was very reasonable on price and the burgers and shakes were delicious. Easy to decide what to order. The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars because they didn't have a changing table in the bathroom for my friends baby. Everyone was friendly tho and the food came out fast."}
{"text":"Way too busy. When the drive thru line gets long, it blocks cars from getting out of their spots to leave the lot. The bathrooms are dirty. The fries are usually just not good. The tables are usually dirty inside and outside as well. The only positive thing I can say is that any In-N-Out location is better than any Tucson location."}
{"text":"I don't touch Mc dee's, Burger King, Jack in the Box, or any of those fast food burger joints anymore but I will never EVER quit In n Out!  Ever since I was little I used to go to the Sahara location with my sisters.  Not only are their burgers made to order but their patties \"are free of additives, fillers and preservatives of any kind.\" They also have a secret menu where I'm pretty sure many know about animal style fries and burgers already.  If you're really hungry, you can order a 5x5...or even go larger than that."}
{"text":"This was the very first In-N-Out burger I ever visited.  It was 1992 and I was 12 and new to the West Coast.   We waited in line for over an hour to get that first cheeseburger and fell in love on the spot! This day changed my burger life forever more.  Now to the present...I don't really visit this location often since I no longer live in this part of town.  When I do visit, I am usually pleased with my experience.  The food is consistent with the other In-N-Out locations, the service is the best, and the staff is unbelievably happy.  And yeah, the foo is totally delectable!  I do wish the parking situation was better at this location.  It is always really crowded and it is hard to find a spot.  The parking lot is also usually dirty with trash scattered everywhere.  This probably isn't In-N-Out's fault and more so the shopping center where it is located, but it is still a bit of an eye-sore.  Other locations I visit seem to always have someone out there picking up the parking lot, but I have never seen anyone doing that at this location.    Also, I am really not comfortable leaving my car in the parking lot at night.  This neighborhood has just gone down a bit and there seems to be some shady looking people hanging out in the parking lot after dark.  If I am here after dark, I do the drive thru and head out of there ASAP.    These last things are the only reasons why this location doesn't get 5 stars from me because I am still in awe of the work of art that is an In-N-Out cheeseburger.  Yum!"}
{"text":"It's In-N-Out.  Of course it's gonna be delicious.  Can you ever really go wrong with one of these scrumptious hamburgers?  The service here is very good - fast, friendly, and efficient.  However, I don't know if it's my imagination or what but the In-N-Out's in California seem to taste better.  My go-to order at In-N-Out is always a hamburger with grilled onions.  Although my burger was tasty today at this location, the bun was not toasted enough and the lettuce was a little too wet, which made the bun soggier.  Minor complaints, but enough to take a star away.  But, the parking lot was big and the service was exceptionally faster than other places, so I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Thought I'd pump out an update to my original review almost 3 years ago... Stopped by (via Drive-Thru) around 11am in efforts to beat the lunch crowds and it worked. Yes, I was still a little full from my bagel this morning, but I only had to sit and wait 5-7 minutes...  Again, same menu items since 1948 (I think?) and relatively cheap. I like that they don't \"sell out\" and add on trending foods or even package their burgers/fries into combo's - they keep it all OG and it works for them.  Not a huge huge fan of their fries but I still jam them down my face. Friendly and fast service always, which is refreshing to me.  Only thing w/In-N-Out that is like a tiny insect crawling in my ear is the \"JOHN 3:16\" stamp on the bottom of their drink cups. Obviously, this is a religious verse but it just bugs me, you know? I'm not a Satanist who drinks goat's blood and bursts into flames on seeing any Christian references, but I just don't want it on my food products. I dunno - it's hard to explain I guess. I wonder if this ever poses issue within their employees who don't *happen* to be Christian?? I could honestly debate this all day... But just like the fries, it doesn't deter me from business and cramming down their burgers. :)"}
{"text":"The service was quick and the store was clean, the only thing that I didn't care for were the over cooked French fries, it reminded me of the shoe string potatoes you get in a can, very similar to that. As always the employees are polite and respectful."}
{"text":"Nothing and go with In-N-Out burgers for lunch! I love animal fries with cheese burgers!"}
{"text":"This is my second trip to In-N-Out burger, and my take on it hasn't changed.  It's a fast food joint.  I had the combo, with the burger ordered animal style.  The burger was good, but I did not find it to be the gloriousness of all burgers as so many other reviewers do.  Perhaps my expectations were set too high by so many wonderful reviews.  I did like the special sauce on the burger, but it didn't taste much different to me than any other burger at any other place.  The fries are okay, same story, good but not fantastic.  For less than $6, it was a decent lunch.  The line was crazy long - be prepared for a wait - I'm told it's always like that.  There is a merchandise store right next door, and they had some great sales - scored 3 T-shirts for the kids for $12 total.  I was pretty happy about that."}
{"text":"Had my first experience with a In-N-Out grilled cheese today with grilled onions. Amazing! A must try if you love cheese! Look up the secret menu online before going in to find many more tasty gems. Service was fantastic as usual. Overall great! Love me some In-N-Out!"}
{"text":"Oh In N Out how I love thee. Your burgers are fresh and your service is great. I don't get weird looks when I order a double double protein style with onion and extra mustard, just a smile and a what else can I get for you? Yesterday service was particularly good and the nice gentleman that took our order came around to make sure that we were doing good. He was friendly and made good conversation. The burgers taste great and I will keep coming back for more. In N Out does it right. Keepin it real, keepin it simple, it works!"}
{"text":"Ok, so Phoenix has no great Chicago pizza, no good Chicago hot dogs and I haven't found a place that has an even passable Chicago beef, but it does have one thing Chicago doesn't-  In N Out.    The one I was at is in Tempe, but I'm too lazy to add it.   They're all over the place, I'm sure you've seen them."}
{"text":"Came to in n out last night around 12 am . Horrible drive thru cashier . I got the double double protein style and some animal fries  . After the first bite into my burger the meat tasted off . I thought it was just my taste buds . I ate it and 2 hours later I woke up with horrible stomach pains and diarrhea. It's 143pm and I still haven't been able to eat anything without running to the restroom !!!  Im going to confirm this with a doctor and seriously call the health department on this location!!"}
{"text":"I agree In-N-Out burger are the best in the west coast there always very fresh, excellent taste every single time!"}
{"text":"Excellent food as I have come to expect with any In-N-Out.  Unlike other In-N-Outs this one is not too busy considering it is new and in a developing shopping center.  Like I said the food is great.  I never want to go inside and sit down most fast food restaurants, but this In-N-Out is clean and friendly and worth getting out of the car for."}
{"text":"Not sure how to start with this place ! I never thought about leaving a review for a fast food joint. But I can tell you this one is not an ordinary fast food place. It is a house full of happy people. From the 30 minutes I spent there I couldn't help but to notice the environment the people working there have. When we had order taken they were calling order #32 out order number was 59.  We had our order ready less than 20 minutes , the crew had the biggest grin on their faces the entire time and got 27 order ready in 20 minutes . I thought that was really impressive! \"Orlando\" acts like he owns the place. Sooo impressed and happy I stopped by and saw this operation , it motivated me to bring in and out to KC !"}
{"text":"This is the best hangover cure around!    You must keep in mind this is a tourist location so it gets extremely busy because this is a very popular stop for people on the East Coast visiting Las Vegas as there is not any In-N-Outs on the East Coast.  There is a drive thru here and you will see many cabs, Uber's, Lyft's and limos here!    The wait is never more then 15 minutes which is very fast considering the lines here!  They also have many workers constantly cleaning up to make this a clean environment to work which is simply amazing since it is so busy knocking out orders non-stop.  I actually heard this is the most profitable and busy locations in the Country!  In the end, everyone does an amazing job here so keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Normally, we don't really eat cheeseburgers, but whenever we are in California or Vegas, we always stop at In-N-Out for cheeseburgers. We can't help ourselves.  I don't think any of their ingredients are \"special\" per se, unless by \"special\" we mean fresh, made-to-order, and delicious because that is what In-N-Out is all about. We scoped this location from our hotel window on the Strip and made a bee-line over there before the lunch crowd.  While still slightly crowded, we got our order soon and enjoyed every. single. bite."}
{"text":"Always a little wait but it's always worth it. Always tastes so fresh    Grilled onions is the way to go"}
{"text":"Can't get a better burger for the price. This particular in-n-out always has fast and friendly service. Those kids work their butts off. Love the fresh cut fries!"}
{"text":"It's been almost a year since I've been in the West Coast, so when I came to Las Vegas in June, I had to hit up an In-N-Out.   Still as good as I had remembered it to be! I ordered the #3 combo but I swapped the regular fries for animal style (with extra spread on the side, as suggested by a fellow Yelper on my In-N-Out review of one of the LA locations). The onions were cooked for a quick few seconds and added a slight sweetness to each bite. The rest of the veggies were fresh, which I always appreciate in my burgers.   To the Yelper who suggested I get extra spread on the side for my animal fries -- THANK YOU! The extra packets really helped a lot with the fries at the bottom."}
{"text":"Food was great, customer service was great, food was cheap, bathrooms are clean...what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Super good!!!! I totally wish we had this at home . Everything is reasonable priced and burgers taste delicious!!"}
{"text":"Okay, where do Hawaii people go to as soon as they land in Vegas?  You guessed it, In-N-Out.  We ordered animal style on the burgers and fries and talk about yummy, this was a meal that totally satisfied our burger and fry craving.  My wife felt guilty after eating here saying, next meal, we need to eat some fresh green salad.  I told her, that's why we are on vacation right?  Forget the salad and eat on!"}
{"text":"We dined in right after arriving in LAS and I was underwhelmed during my first visit. Burger was cheap & tasty, but not worth the raves IMO, and found the animal style fries mediocre. Very friendly service, though."}
{"text":"Love this place! I only go about once a year, but when I'm feeling like fast food I wait it out here for the cheeseburger with grilled onions protein style with lots of fries and ketchup!!  The lines are sometimes overwhelming, but the staff has it under control and they move through the orders pretty quickly.  The hardest part about eating here is finding a table!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love in-n-out burger. This place is always packed and there is always a line inside and outside but they seem to manage the crowds well. Employees are always friendly and deliver your burger and fries with a smile on their face. I also have the protein style burger as my go to meal."}
{"text":"the first restaurant my beautiful wife and i had eaten together from was this in-n-out. both my wife and i had gotten animal style burgers and some animal style fries to share.   i thought the burger was better than most other fast food places and the sauce they use for animal style was really good, but it was pretty ordinary for the majority of it.  the fries had kind of a stale recooked taste to them but weren't completely inedible with them being animal style i suppose.  there wasn't much business even with it being close to where one of the election's debates was being held. however, even with them having almost no traffic through their drive-thru and looking like they had little to no business inside, they were pretty slow at giving us our food.  the food might've been alright, service was slow as HECK, but being together with my wife, whom i had met for the first time in person and were experiencing our first meal together was one of the best experiences i've ever had and i'm glad i'm so lucky to be engaged to the best person in my whole entire life as well as being the absolute bestest and most beautiful wife in the whole entire multiverse and beyond is an experience i'm absolutely ecstatic to have had such an incredible time (regardless of in-n-out and its staff at this location's downsides) with the person that i am so insanely grateful to have met that this was such an unforgettable time in my life.  thanks, in-n-out."}
{"text":"The last time I visited the west coast I wasn't able to visit this place but I made it my mission to this time. While waiting for check-in I decided to grab a bite to eat because I was starving from traveling.  I walked in and there was a long line which is expected, however, it went by quickly. I ordered the cheeseburger and fries with a drink. I believe it came to $8 which wasn't bad.  So as I receive my food, I was lucky enough to find a seat on the patio because it was crowded. The first bite I take was the French fries and they were very crispy. I thought it was a couple but no it was 80% of my fries. I don't know if that's what it was supposed to be like but I didn't have the patience to wait in line for a new batch. I then took a bite in the burger and it was pretty good. Very fresh. Overall I guess my expectations were too high and I was slightly disappointed. It was average to me."}
{"text":"One great hamburger! Worth adding the grilled onions. Sometimes I get it protein style if I don't want the extra calories from the bun but it's best with it. This is the place for a great burger."}
{"text":"This In N Out at UNLV tends to have a particularly amusing clientele:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tro-hrljuY1cUAVFYauTlQ?select=1uPB-IOaoWd4s2jNFpZgVw  Love the appreciation for irony there.  Nice.    Oh yeah the burgers are better than crack too."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. Yeah yeah, burn me at the stake for this one but I don't get the hype. Maybe it's because I'm an East Coaster with access to good eats but I genuinely do not get it. Taste like an average burger with Big Mac sauce on it.. or at least what I remember Big Mac sauce to taste like. Nothing special about the fries either. Blah"}
{"text":"I LOVE In-N-Out but this location is the slowest I've ever been too!(California included) I can understand long wait when they are busy but there were only 3 other cars in the drive thru and a handful of people inside."}
{"text":"Great hamburgers and very clean place. Always nice and they stay open late on weekends. The menu is so short it makes life a little easier. We love In*N*Out"}
{"text":"Great burgers, quick service, pretty cheap for the food quality and quantity. Don't be intimidated by the long lines, they are very speedy and efficient. Hardest thing is trying to find a seat. Got the #1 which is the double double meal and got the burger animal style. Animal style adds a special sauce to the burger. The fries are chopped fresh in house, so freshness is guaranteed."}
{"text":"Schlichtes FastFood Restaurant mit kleiner Speisekarte (Hamburger, Cheeseburger, Doppel-Cheeseburger, Pommes, Getränke, Milchshakes) und netten Mitarbeitern abseits der hektischen Innenstadt von Las Vegas.  Wer will kann sich Merchandise-Shirts kaufen. Essen war völlig in Ordnung für den Preis und wir sind satt ins Bett gegangen!   ///    Simple Fast Food Restaurant with small menu (Hamburger, Cheeseburger, double-Cheeseburger, french fries, beverages, milkshakes) and nice staff. Marchandise is also available. The food was pretty good and for the price a great value."}
{"text":"I love this In & Out! It's phenomenal. I would go here just for a milkshake. I like their sauce. It's delicious. In & Out is one of the reasons I love living in Gilbert AZ. Honestly."}
{"text":"I've eaten at In-N-Out a dozen times but today this locations hamburger was really salty. I hope they get it changed I will change my rating"}
{"text":"In-N-Out is the hands down best franchise/chain burger joint around.    A simple no-frills menu means that they can concentrate on providing the freshest, highest quality ingredients, such as crisp lettuce, fresh tomatoes,  never frozen patties and fresh cut fries cooked in clean oil.   Also the free refills on drinks is great, especially during summer in Phoenix.  Decor wise, In-N-Out keeps it clean and classic, like the burger joints of yore.    Service is quick and friendly, likely because the the staff are paid higher the minimum wage  For those in the know, there is a 'secret' menu that can be used to customize your orders.  4 out of 5 stars because, it is still a chain after all..."}
{"text":"Omg this place is amazing never had this in oklahoma this location is clean and the food was amazing"}
{"text":"I love In n Out. And since I'm the Duke, guess I've got to write a review on it right?  The food here is by far the best you get for the price you pay. Only complaint is I wish they had Bacon for my burger, but that'd probably be not good for my health! I love their hours as well, they are open very late even on weekdays (1:30 I believe?). They are always clean with friendly service.  Whether you're getting a burger, fries, or a shake, you'll definitely be pleased!  And you can hit up the drive thru too!"}
{"text":"Deliocus as always. They were super busy and seating was filled so we had to take our dine in order to go and found a place nearby to eat."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of In-N-Out. Delicious food at an affordable price. I like that the burgers are thin and not thick with just the right amount of sauce and fresh Ingredients. I also like the fact that their portions are normal insted of ridiculously large. Service is quick & friendly and most importantly they are always consistent."}
{"text":"I love coming here; this place is my guilty pleasure.  One day a month when I'm about to get my monthly this is my jam!  I usually only order a burger and a diet soda, but if my boyfriend goes with me he orders a shake and fries and of course what's his is mine!  The staff are always very friendly and give me exactly what I asked for- usually extra pickles and ketchup.  I have never had an issue at this In and Out Burger!  I get the same great service each time and the same order I expect and crave."}
{"text":"i am a fan of the In-N-Out Burger hype. I've tried it before in San Fran back in 2008, it was good but  did not impress me too much and I was not aware of Animal style.... fail...... so when I was planning a trip to Vegas, I had to make sure to revisit In-N-Out Burger and make sure my double double is animal style. I really enjoy the way the burgers are carefully crafted, every bite has everything i want in it, and it doesnt end up being a big mess that falls apart. From the crisp outer but soft innerds of the bun, freshly cooked patties, fresh veggies, and the flavors of animal style all mixed together to call for a completely enjoyable experience. I could have lived without the animal on the fries, did not enjoy that as much, just a little overboard, i think it was the carmalized onions that didnt mix well on the fries for me. I did observe that they cut the potatoes in the kitchen, not to mention the service is very friendly and efficient.  I walked to In-N-Out Burger from the strip (~15 min walk under a bridge, and sidewalk accross a bridge, and cross at a heavy intersection) but I would def do it again, no brainer.  Rumors of one coming to Garland Texas, I sure hope that comes true!"}
{"text":"What else to say?  In N Out + Secret Menu = Paradise"}
{"text":"More like \"In-and-Wait.\" A long line wrapped around half the perimeter of the building. We were lucky to find a table tucked away in a far corner because there was pretty much no where to sit- inside or outside. The fries were hot and crunchy but BLAND.  The burgers were pretty good and tasted homemade. My diet coke was spot on. The male staff looked really cute in their retro uniforms. Other than that I wasnt too impressed with this particular location and wished we had went to Fattyburger instead."}
{"text":"I can deal with in n out being slow because it's so good.  But this one is ridiculously slow.  The people who work there operate in slow motion."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about this location, but I just don't find it as good as other locations.  It's in a great spot, I like the area...it used to be they got the order wrong a lot or you had to repeat it constantly (this has gotten a lot better & they are managing the lines & people better)....but the taste & quality of the food is just not the same for me compared to other locations. I feel like In n Out should be the same no matter which one you go to, especially when in the same metro area."}
{"text":"Ok, so I didn't just go to get my friend a tshirt that he wanted from the vegas in and out. Really like their burgers and was trying to watch the carbs so they offered them protein style. No bread and large pieces of lettuce on the outside so you can eat like on a bun. Partner I was with had the traditional with bun and also enjoyed. Didn't eat any fries this trip either but they are also some of my favorites amongst the burger joints. Thshirts only set me back 950 each"}
{"text":"As In-N-Out Burgers go, this is a good one. It gets busy, but the staff is friendly, helpful and quick.  I usually head here after leaving the strip so I get there between 9-11pm. The topping always taste fresh and the fries were well cooked.   If you have a craving for lunch or a quick late night snack, swing on in."}
{"text":"Woot!!! So excited to have a In and Out close to the house!   The hubs went by on Friday night and picked up some burgers and fries for dinner! So Yum! Everything always tastes so fresh! I am a huge fan of the fries!   I think its great that they put an In and Out in the location they did, Metro needs some new life breathed into it! Plus its right off the I-17 which makes sense for the long distance travelers to swoop in and grab something to eat."}
{"text":"What is not to love about In-N-Out Burger?! Quality ingredients, never frozen, simple menu and amazing food!   I like to keep it simple with a cheeseburger. I love that the cold ingredients are nice and chilled, while the rest of the burger is hot hot! The flavor is great, fries are always hot, crispy and lighly salted. The prices are so affordable as well, I love that part. They are cheaper than most McD's sandwiches too!   We have never seen an employee here who is not cheerful and outgoing. They genuinly look happy to be there. In the drive-thru, if you are on your way out of town or just eating while driving, they offer you one of their paper placemats to put on your lap. Your burgers will also be given to you in an open box, rather than a bag. Nice touch!"}
{"text":"Love In and Out!  The people working here are always nice and courteous!  They haven't even messed up my orders yet!"}
{"text":"Being from California I was hoping that it was as good as it is in California and it was!  The burgers and fries are always fresh and hot.  Also, best value for money.  All-in-all it doesn't get any better than these burgers and fries."}
{"text":"We had a great experience. We were greeted by Jas, who took our order for 'protein style' burgers, which have iceberg lettuce in place of the bun. She was a very cheerful person.  As we found our seat, Parker was just finishing up wiping down the table. He was also extremely pleasant, smiled and wished us a great day.  The lettuce on our burgers was icy cold, and there was a lot of it! The burgers were tasty.  We love In n Out. Besides the great food, the staff always makes our visit top notch."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Miss their yummy protein style burgers!"}
{"text":"Really people it's in n out burger do I really have to say anymore except. Fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"In-n-out rocks! Food is delicious and it is comparatively cheap. You also get a big portion for the amount of money. I love how they overload you on fries and there are a ton extra at the bottom of the bag."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best burger joints in AZ. I love getting my burger protein style (no buns, replaced with iceberg lettuce). The fries here are amazing! The best pRt about it is the price. Very very very cheap!"}
{"text":"I love there food, fast the best and so good. Do not forget to check out there secret menu and try something off of it next time u r there. The fries r so good and fresh. Give it a try at least once if u gave not."}
{"text":"If I could give it a 10, I would.  Double-double animal style.  Do it.   TIP - if you're really, really hungry... get 2."}
{"text":"Great inexpensive and good meal just off the strip. Fast service and great customer service."}
{"text":"In-N-out is one of my favorite hamburger restaurants. Changing my eating habits and decided to try a protein style burger. I can say it wasn't a bad burger, I just have to adjust not having the buns.  The drive thru is always busy, but you get through the line pretty fast. They always have a person outside to take with  orders as well. The area is pretty tight but the traffic does get thru. Overall, good service and good food."}
{"text":"Well had my first in and out burger this week... I am from the east cost we don't have in n out. And I can't ever have a fast food burger ever again with out thinking how much better an in n out burger is"}
{"text":"i want to say that i loved in-n-out, but unfortunately, the burger was good on an empty stomach, and the fries were mediocre. We asked for them well done, and they still seemed under-cooked. I can't see how people compare it to shake shack, as both have completely different styles. shake shack is more of a gourmet burger compared to in-n-out, but in-n-out is more reasonable priced for a burger. I don't think i would crave their burgers or fries, but i would have it if we happened to be near one and wanted a quick bite."}
{"text":"The staff here was very friendly and despite the minor rush/traffic, we got our food in a very timely manner."}
{"text":"I ordered the Dbl Dbl Animal Style. The bread and all the toppings to the meat are made fresh. Their potatoes never see the inside of a freezer. This place is a must any location will do. Great customer service, great food with fantastic quality."}
{"text":"This location is the closest to the strip, I have never been when there is not a line, because of this.  They have a great staff and get you through the line quickly and get your food out HOT.  If you have never been, the menu consists of hamburgers, fries and shakes.  Non meat eaters beware.  They have options that are not on the menu, search \"In-N-Out secret menu\" online to find your options.  My typical order is a double double cheeseburger, animal style with chopped chilies. I love that the fries are so fresh that you can see them being cut in the kitchen right before they are fried up for your enjoyment.  Turnover is pretty quick as far as tables go, at the time that you arrive if you don't find a table, just wait for your food and one will open up."}
{"text":"This is the AWESOME PLACE EVER. The Burgers are so juicy,fresh,and tasty the fries well Hmmm they are soo good"}
{"text":"I absolutely love In N Out anywhere (except the one in Pacific Beach, which sucks), but this one was amazing. My wife and I were both blown away at how good it is. Every time I go to Vegas I have to eat at a few In N Outs on the drive up and while there. The one on the drive up was just okay, but this one was so flavorful and fresh. They put a grip of veggies on both my burgers and it was just sooooo goooood! Glad we skipped hooters for it! Short drive from the strip. Entertaining little neighborhood."}
{"text":"Good, but it takes a long time, even with drive-thru.  Still, it's worth it.  Only downfall is access to it.  You're not able to go in except through one exit off of the street, which you can't make a left turn out of.  And no access through the shopping center; however, through now fault of their own.  The access is just incovenient."}
{"text":"Price was right. Cool concept but I like 5 guys better. What A Burger is my favorite burger, guess you could say I'm old school. In and out was busy and had good service but as for the burger's. A lot of hype."}
{"text":"Always come here great burgers and great prices . Can't go wrong with these guys on a late night. Highly recomm"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this location.  I reside in LA County home of the in n out burger,  and frankly as much as I love in n out, this location by far is not up to par with the many other locations I've been to. My girlfriend lives no more than 1 mile away, and today's experience has made me decide to review this place.   First off,  the design of how the drive thru is makes it difficult for dine in customers to park on the side where it begins.  As the line gets long,  you would be stuck in your parking space with dumb drivers still blocking you as you're halfway out of your space.  Yes this just happened to me.   Now for my food. Presentation is pretty much standard for all locations. I got my normal,  post workout meal of a cheeseburger,  mustard fry,  whole grilled onions and a double meat,  whole grilled onions and lettuce wrapped and man do I regret getting it lettuce wrapped.  The lettuce doesn't even wrap around the meats,  and for being whole grilled onions,  I got a measly two rings of onions???  Really?!  Ugh. My cheeseburger was alright I guess since pretty much tastes the same as all the other places I've been to.    The workers were friendly so that's a plus,  and was quick to open an additional register once the dine in line became long. The workers and cleanliness off the location is the only thing that stopped me from giving this place 2 stars.   I don't ask for much from in n out,  just the same quality and comfort that you get at every location."}
{"text":"Great place, very helpful.  Even when it's busy as hell, people always clear out at a rate that lets you grab a table by the time your food's ready. The cashiers are super friendly, quick, and nice. Everyone's always working, clearing tables, mopping, holding doors, wiping things down. I love this place.  Also, for vegetarians, get the Animal style Grilled Cheese. I used to think that the only thing I missed about meat-eating was In n Out burgers -- now I have no excuse. This place is bomb-diggity.  P.S. Milkshakes. Get one."}
{"text":"The location is packed! Expect a line and be a shark when it comes to grabbing seats! I was excited to try In-N-Out for my first time, as I have had several friends rave about the taste for the price. In my honest opinion, it was good, but not as good as it's all hyped up to be. I would definitely pick it over Burger King or McDonald's, and even Five Guys because of the price, but the taste falls short for me. I wouldn't go out to seek this place, but I will eat it again if I am in the mood for a quick cheeseburger."}
{"text":"First time to this location. Nearby if on north end of strip.  A short line but waited a bit for the burgers. Crowded but able to get a seat.   Burger was delish. Fries were good. Slightly under but still fine.   Staff very friendly. A great lunch!"}
{"text":"Ok so the burger was pretty good. Would prob get a single next time. Fries are pretty good alone but add your own salt.  What amazed me was the shakes. So smooth and creamy. Definitely will change your life!"}
{"text":"They forgot my fries...  C'mon guys, a combo meal is...say it with me...  A burger + a drink + FRIES  And yet they forgot the stinking fries.  Kid's screaming, can't turn the car around and get back in line..."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is simply our go-to burger joint. The double-double with grilled onions and extra crispy fries has never failed me when I'm looking for a quick and satisfying meal. And just like what the slogan says, \"it's what hamburgers are all about\"!"}
{"text":"Best employees. So friendly compared to all the other in n outs. Ask what the secret menu is about, they're very knowledgeable. Very clean restrooms. Although the dining might get a little messy on the weekends, that's normal. Drive thrus are faster when a person is out taking your order on their iPad looking thing"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst In N Out in Arizona.   I have been doing some great volunteer work such as volunteering with a politician and I wanted to set up an event at this location because it is by my parents house and the cashier and manager couldn't have been any more rude. IT LITERALLY WAS NOT THAT CONFUSING. It's funny how the manager rudely says \"well call corporate if you want us to\"  No bro you pass the word on you're a manager I'm a volunteer dummy   Ok now for this location. You have a bunch of immature kids working here. I knew some homies at different locations and some of the workers go \"I'll Snapchat that person\" Really bro? I just tried to be cool with you. Or how about the workers just parking right next to the traffic. Or them having more respect for immature high school kids as customers since it's a lame hangout. What about managers yelling at me for asking about a former friend or if she was a worker I don't care either way. What about the girl telling me about her coworkers being fat? That was a good Facebook live  or that same girl questioning me on getting a milkshake after a workout \"doesn't that defeat the purpose\" no I have abs smh  Anyway ima eat at other in n outs from this point on. This one annoys the shit out of me"}
{"text":"I love this In N Out. It is right next to ASU and by Tempe Marketplace where there are movies and fun things to do.  It's cool since they are open until 1am and the food is always fresh. WAY BETTER THEN MCDONALDS AND BURGER KING  they actually pay employees here and respect their employees with good management.  Go Devils  Ask for Felicia. While she gives perfect service and they make her stand outside she talked about lost children of Babylon with me and her country music. Despite her taste in rap she's a good worker lmao"}
{"text":"Lemme tell you about this in n out. I'm a broke loser and only had $5 in my pocket but I was with my homie Richard from south phx that I met on fb cause whatever that's what I do just add random people. I go to the drive through and the sweetest girl Bre made me laugh. I've been crying like a little child cause I'm so broke and me and Richard drank some beers and just wanted to get a damn burger. So whenever I ask girls what music they like they give me stupid answers \"everything\" not hot Bre she jammed out with some immortal technique, Vinnie Paz, lost children of Babylon and the weekend. She likes rap but listens to lame mainstream artists like most young girls these days but she was a sweet heart and she's a total babe. She told me about U of A too and I hate you of A cause it's ASU town baby. Fork em Devils. I go to all the practices and know the players. I sell shoes to them and work for the Democrats. Whenever I wanna cry I go to in n out and just cry eating my double double cheeseburger with onions on their stupid paper mat. What am I supposed to do with that dumb mat wipe my face with it? I ruined my ASAP Ferg shirt being a retard making a fb live video cause I love In N Out so much. Wait I'm not done with Bre. Since I was crying about girls all night cause I'm a lonely loser she made me happy. No one honked their horn at me cause of the stickers on my car and they better put some respect on the name and Richard is an OG from south phx. I went inside and talked to the awesome manager and got the other coworkers names but Bre made the impact. She's the cutie, she's the real one, she's the champ. She kept it 100. I hope In N out learns from Bre and when I ask a girl what music they listen to they don't give me the lame \"everything\" answer smh or \"Spanish\" I'm white i don't speak Spanish but I roll with the Mexican homies. I'll be coming back to this one for sure cause of cute, sweet, funny, hilarious girls like Bre. I asked her the secrets of In N Out but she wouldn't tell me cause she's real sneaky. But I'm crazy so I'll find out these secrets one way or another. Wait I'm not done with Bre she's a white girl with blonde hair. Not my type sorry. I like the Latina crazy girls. So she's not crazy just funny, goofy, jams out to music and keeps it real for the homies. I'm gonna keep coming back to this one and show my charm to Bre. Maybe I'll try and get to know her and stop dating normal ?"}
{"text":"I'm from southern California where In N Out was born and this location is a disgrace to In N Outs. All I ordered was animal fries, well done. No burgers, no shakes, just some extra crispy fries with cheese, onions and sauce on top. We patiently waited over 25 minutes before my husband went up and asked someone the status of our fries. The guy behind the counter was amused for some reason, as he laughed in my husband's face and stammered like a burn out \"well, you see, the thing is... uh, there was like... a disagreement on what well done was?\" What the heck does that mean?? The manager comes over and asks what's going on, and come to find out they burned my fries, threw those ones out, then just forgot about our order all together! Not ok! Took us about 45 minutes to get just one order of animal fries. The employees obviously don't care to live up to the In N Out standards."}
{"text":"The food always tastes delicious, the service is always great. Even if the line is out the door they still manage to take your order within minutes."}
{"text":"I am originally from LA and the wait for IN-N-OUT was always at least 15-30 mins and to live in Henderson where the line is less than 10 mins it is phenomenal. The same great taste and quality for shorter the wait.  I love eating healthy so I would get the burger with no salt, no spread, extra lettuce + tomatoes, and yellow peppers on the side. I know it is a pain for them but they have never disappointed me."}
{"text":"My husband and I visit this In-N-Out every 4-5 weeks or so to satiate our \"Animal Style\" cravings. I won't reiterate on what to order, just know that whatever special order you dream up, they'll get it correct every single time. The staff is always so polite and their work ethic is always top notch. Be prepared to wait 4-5 minutes for an inside order and around 7-8 minutes in the drive thru if you come during dinner or lunch rush. Worth it to get a well constructed burger just how I ordered it. :) The only complaint I could ever have is that their tomatoes are always mealy-textured, like not ripe enough. It must be their supplier because it's the same thing at every store. During the school year, the place is understandably packed with UNLV students; as such it has a really wonderful energy. It's my favorite In-N-Out location!"}
{"text":"Being a native NY'ker,  In and Out burger is something you hear about from west coasters but don't really pay much attention to the hype  mostly because I mean,  its a burger,  how good could it be? And generally,  New Yorkers are a hard to impress species anyway. Well let me just say,  In and Out has certainly lived up to the hype. This is one damn good burger. I recently visited this location in the midst of exorbantly overpriced food and drinks on the Las Vegas strip,  I was able to experience this tasty treasure for all of....$3.41!!! Granted I didn't get fries or a drink,  but this is a pretty filling burger and a steal for under 4 bucks. If you do visit this location,  prepare to stand on a looooong line and wait,  but it moves rather quickly and they have outdoor seating which if the weather is pleasant,  it's nice to enjoy your burger outside people watching. I'm kinda glad they don't have In and Out burger on the east coast,  I don't think my jeans would appreciate it."}
{"text":"Love this place! I have yet t have an issue while ordering here.  They are always friendly and helpful they do their very best to keep it clean.. Only down side is it gets BUSY but I think that's all in and out burger places lol"}
{"text":"Always friendly service. I used to like their burgers when I ate meat, but now I just order their fries animal-style. Yum. I heard their grilled cheese is good too"}
{"text":"I go here and only order a burger. Wait 12 minutes and it's raw. I call back to try to speak to someone about this and the phone just rings for 4 minutes. I wasted my lunch break at work coming here. Now I'm still hungry and might have been exposed to food borne illness.   \"CONSUMER ADVISORY: Consuming raw or undercooked meats, poultry, seafood, shellfish, eggs or unpasteurized milk may increase your risk of foodborne illness\"  Then you give a receipt that says questions or comments call us and you don't answer.   I went during lunch hour, and it was busy. but that is the point of your establishment to HANDLE business not endanger health. Both Patties were undercooked but one is almost completely raw and the other one has pink. How are they two different levels of doneness if cooled simultaneously?"}
{"text":"I fully am on the side of In-N-Out  --- about that current NEW 'news' I now heard about the legal dispute that In-N-Out has brought against Smash Burger.  As I have patronized In-N-Out for decades. I never ate, nor would spend the price of a SB gourmet burger."}
{"text":"I really don't see what the hype is about? Came here and stopped by for the first time on MLK weekend just before we headed to the airport to go back home. Line was long, and not a lot of seating. Tried their burger and animal fries. Everything just tasted so bland, stale, and disgusting. And too much onions on the animal fries, gross!  I'm really not sure if I can bring myself to give this place another chance, and I don't know if I came on a bad or off day, or what. But the food was just terrible! I didn't even finish my meal."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is great!  I love their burgers and fries.  They have friendly staff every time I go there.  I was there today and their food is very good for the money.   My 2 old year loves going there because he get stickers.  Keep up the good work In-N-Out!  :)"}
{"text":"I really dont know what the hype is about this burger joint. I been to several different locations and it isn't all that great. But my friends that I was with never had it so they wanted to try it but they weren't impressed either."}
{"text":"Came in with my family at 7:15 pm on 3/7/16. Ordered 3 hamburgers, 2 fries and 2 drinks - order #35. So while waiting for our food I notice orders 36, 37, 38 and a car service order is handed out while our order sits on the counter by the fryer. I finally ask why is ours sitting there? \"Because the other orders had only one order of fries.\" Really? Call it what it is. In an effort to get more orders out you sacrificed mine because it had 2 orders of fries while my meal gets cold. My wife and son agreed to take their orders while I requested a refund on my #3 at $5.45 plus tax. What does she give me? 5 ones, 2 quarters, 3 dimes, one nickel and 7 pennies (kind of excessive, huh?)."}
{"text":"First, In-N-Out is one of those things people obsess over when it's not local to them. I've been to Las Vegas a few times and had it in the past. I don't recall it leaving an impression. I'd prefer to give a 2.5 stars rating.      I got in late tonite and decided, let's give it a go again. I got an order to go of 3, double-doubles with pickles and onions, an order of fries, and a chocolate milkshake.      The order was ready pretty quickly (I went through the drive thru). It looked and smelled pretty good, but I was starving. My hotel is only 4 minutes away, so that was nice.      I unpacked my order and it all looked tasty. Appeared very fresh. The fries were somehow a bit cold already, possibly stale. I felt like it had some black flecks on them, like when the fryer oil needs a change. They were \"eh\". Base off of this particular order, I wouldn't get their fries again, but I know it might occasionally happen.      The burgers were quite large. Almost to the point of overstuffed, but because of the lettuce and tomatoes. The beef patties were cooked well and had a good taste. A bit of the problem with the over stuffing is the animal sauce made it VERY messy. The ratio of patty to everything else is a bit off. Eating the burger, a lot of it slides all over and you end up with kind of a wet handful of bun, sauce, lettuce, and tomatoes.      Overall, I think I may have had enough In-N-Out Burger. I probably wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"Love this food! Service is amazing. Everyone is always in a good mood!!! Animal fríes are always so perfect."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I have tried In and Out burger! It's always good. However last nights experience was a memory! They were extremely busy like usual. However they had one of their employees outside taking everyones order. She was very friendly, had AWESOME recommendations on what to get and add on. She's a ROCK STAR! Then the dude at the last window was rude. Think he was stressed out. Click or Clint his name was. My buddy also agreed the first employee was wonderful. The guy who provided us our food was rude and strange. Overall we will stop by this In and Out location again."}
{"text":"This In and Out Burger location knows how to make a first class burger! The fries were crispy and just the right amount of salt. Both my friend and I received fantastic customer service from the cashier! He is very smart, outgoing and quite efficient. The restaurant is very clean inside and out. Will come by again!"}
{"text":"They've almost always offered a water cup. Nice staff. Food is good as every in n out."}
{"text":"This place was rocking busy, but the staff was awesome. Food was great, fresh, and spot on."}
{"text":"Nothing more to say then I love in -n- out .. so much I ate it twice with in just a couple of days... it's  good , it's cheap and it's fast.. I love the limited menu and the fun atmosphere... It was my favorite thing about Vegas.."}
{"text":"Awesome service - great food and even better company!!!  Not a big fan of In and Out but really enjoyed it today. Had my burger protein style and it was yummy."}
{"text":"I just love there Double Double Animal burger with a side or animal fries. They also have very good milkshakes and you can order them mixed together. Every time I have ever visited In-Out, I have had an amazing experience.  This is by far one of my favorite burger places that deliver delicious burgers and yummy potato cut fries.  I also love there new holiday bags that have Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, Happy Hanukkah, etc. I like how they include all of there customers for the holiday while serving yummy food."}
{"text":"When we come to Vegas we always need to pass by In n Out its a fast food burger shop. But I like that they are very simple not too many crazy toppings but they taste fresh made. The shakes are good. The fries are also cut fresh but to my taste they come out a bit too soggy. I like the retro old school look inside. Overall I would definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"The only negative .... Is that it's so crowded!  The team at this Sahara location is top notch.  Young, energetic, friendly staff.  Very impressed with the cashiers, and drive-thru.  I went here twice on this trip to Vegas.  I'm in management and I would hire many of the workers here if they were in the same state that I reside.  Definitely reflect the management team and culture that these guys have bought into ..... Oh yah .... The food is really good too!  ALOHA!!"}
{"text":"Four star's to the guy in drive threw taking orders.@11:30pm dec 3. Guy was out standing. I work in a hotel on the strip. This kid was golden in the 4 minutes i spoke to him. So wish i caught his name. In&out keep that kid"}
{"text":"So freaking yummy! Double double with grilled onions & no salt is my favorite! No Salt on fries r awesome too!"}
{"text":"We are from Cali and this still tastes the same! Even though it was very busy the staff didn't look overwhelmed. In addition, they where very courteous and respectful when they needed to get thru. Without a doubt glad that most of the employees had a smile and got our food in reasonable time!   P.S. Try the Freddie Style:    A Double double well done. Extra toast. Chopped chilies. Raw and grilled onions. And finally well done fries with it. Trust me it's worth the wait! Also you can get animal style dressing to spice up your order as well!"}
{"text":"I dont know how its possible for me to give a fast food place 5 stars.  But having this in az.  Oh so nice.  tastes just like I remember it in cali. when  I would go to the beach with the ex-girlfriend.  Lifes simple pleasures."}
{"text":"This is worth the flight from NYC alone.   nuff said."}
{"text":"Service was good and staff friendly, but the burger was sloppy and the fries over cooked. Nice convenient spot."}
{"text":"Had a late dinner with kids last night. Very busy and the food showed. Fries were half cooked and buns for the burgers were soggy. Probably would be better when it's not so busy. Will try it again for sure"}
{"text":"Love that they're open late. I arrived to Vegas at about 11pm. Ran to the hotel to leave my bags and ran to in n out. My first time. The burger was great. The fries sucked. Chocolate shake was yummy. I can't wait to visit the west coast again so I can get a double double animal style. Btw the staff was great. The cashier who took our order was patient and friendly. I think his name was Christian."}
{"text":"This might probably my favorite fast food. Its delicious and very cheap as well. Its just too bad that the stores are only here in the West Coast. They should expand more and start having it on the East Coast."}
{"text":"Had my first animal style burger here. Yum! Also got a neopolitan. I wish it would come to the east coast!!!"}
{"text":"In N Out is always incredible! While some locations are busier than others, the customer service remains top notch all across the board. Frankly, with how busy they do get (there's ALWAYS a line) I'm amazed with both the food they put out, the time they do it in, the accuracy they do it with AND with a smile?! Really?! You guys are wonderful!  The short wait has a lot to do with the streamlined menu. Fries, shakes in three flavors, regular burger, cheese burger, double cheese burger.. yep. That's about it. Everything off the \"secret menu\" which is no secret, are just variations from the ingredients found on everything else. A simple Google search can pull up the entire menu for you. My cat would be upset if I got In N Out for myself but neglected to get her favorite- the Flying Dutchman.  My usual - a cheeseburger with light spread, grilled onions, add pickles. Their burgers are perfection in a fast food burger. Squishy toasted bun, sweet grilled onions, salty meat, cool tomato slice, crunchy cold iceberg that gets slightly wilted from the heat of the patty.. you just can't beat it. It's an experience!"}
{"text":"The double double was ok, the fries was horrid. They was so bland with no taste and was not cooked all the way. The line was so long, our total wait from entering door to receiving order was approx 45 mins. While in line a group walks in with a ferret on a leash. Letting the nasty thing ponder the floor like they was in there own house.  It is very in appropriate to take a animal into a fast food place, and letting it ponder. There was a whole lot of disquisted people in line, more then one employee seen it and said nothing to them about having it in the restaraunt."}
{"text":"I'm apparently not in California any more. I had to clean my own table, as three associates walked past aimlessly. And then three of the four burgers were raw in the middle."}
{"text":"Slow service!!!!! Waited over 30 minutes for food!! They would not put people outside and it was just windy! Slow workers!!!!"}
{"text":"Busy but clean love this one at night it really fits in with the Vegas theme. Staff friendly just the usual In & Out business style they got it dialed in."}
{"text":"In N Out is my all the favorite burger. We went through the drive thru this time and they package your food in an open box so you can easily eat it in your car. They always get your order right and serve the food with a smile.   They employees are so nice, it's unreal. They always make sure that you're happy and have everything you need. I don't think I've ever come here and have been disappointed. This location is great because it's near the mall and a bunch of hotels."}
{"text":"Moved here from California, King of the in-n-outs I must say, and I was really disappointed at this in-n-out location... Their meats are extremely salty! I kept going thinking it was that just one time, but no... So if I ever go there, I order the meat \"lightly salted\" in order for it to be perfect. Only have that problem in this vegas location."}
{"text":"I went to In n out with my coworkers after we closed our restaurant. The manager at this location was talking to a team member when we walked in and said \"why are they here\" and gave us dirty looks. My team and i will happily bring our business somewhere else. I'll be sure to tell multiple people about this experience and how the manager of this location talks about the customers."}
{"text":"this place was a mad house yelling out order numbers like it was bingo night! People every where waiting for the icon of a burger!  It was however a very delicious sloppy juicy burger, thanks for the burger wrap or I would have had that special sauce all over my clean crisp white t-shirt!  The fries ahh normal fries but it all was served up hot fresh and delicious!  Sit out side by the fountain and watch all the beautiful honeys walk by!  I love Vegas!"}
{"text":"Whenever I come to Vegas, I go to In-N-Out. Like any other location, this has delicious, affordable food served quickly. You can't walk here from The Strip, but fear not: you won't be the only person being dropped off or picked up in an Uber. Definitely worth finding your way out here."}
{"text":"How can I not give this place five stars??! I love these burgers and fries! The employees are always friendly and fast! Two thumbs waaaay up!"}
{"text":"Like Kate S., I had long heard about the wonders of the In-N-Out (Seattle is full of Cali transplants lamenting the lack of such burgery goodness in the far-flung wilds of the north), so this seemed like a good time to give it a try.  I was too lazy/disorganized to study up on the secret menu, and not overly hungry, so I ended up with a chocolate milkshake and a regular cheeseburger sans onions and tomato.  Through a communication error, I also ended up with a vanilla shake which I gave to my sister, though she never got around to drinking it.  Total cost - just over $6, which was pretty dang good!  The chocolate milkshake was nothing impressive, and I'd skip that next time.  The burger was surprisingly good for a fast food joint - much better than McDonalds and even preferable to my usual choice of Wendy's (not that I eat fast food burgers that often).  Service was efficient, if uninspired, plus there was the minor snafu mentioned above but that's pretty tame by fast food joint standards.  Plenty of available parking.  I wouldn't go out of my way to get an In-N-Out burger, but I certainly wouldn't turn one down either."}
{"text":"First time eating at an In & Out Burger.  I've heard people rave about them, and after trying them, don't really know why.  They have 3 things on their menu, burger, fries, drink.  I walked in, looked at the menu, and thought I must have missed something.  I was just there to grab a quick burger, so I placed my order, then waited over 10 minutes for it to be made.  The drive-thru line stretched throughout the parking lot, so they were busy, but it took longer than I was expecting (for what was really just a burger and fries).  It wasn't bad, but wasn't anything special either.  Really, the lack of menu options is what surprised me the most..."}
{"text":"First time eating at In n Out burger. I've had better burgers and fries from other fast food places. My husband and I also got sick so I'll have to pass on ever eating here again even though they are cheaper."}
{"text":"In-n-Out was introduced to me by some SoCal fanatics - who \"schooled me\" to order from the \"secret menu\" (available on their website) like a pro. So a 3x3 was my first experience. I've since decided a double-double is the right size for me.  The food here is the freshest fast food burger shop faire you'll get. The staff (yes, youngsters) is always extremely cheerful, friendly and patient.  If you need a burger and like the thin cut style fries, this beats the heck out of the golden arches less than a block away (or other national chains)."}
{"text":"This In N Out Burger is the best thing about this rather depressing part of Phoenix. I stayed in the area for two nights solely based on the proximity to an In N Out Burger.   The place is spotlessly clean, and everyone is extremely friendly. We ordered cheeseburgers and fries and chocolate shakes. Everything was great, I was stuffed. It's always fun to eat fast food you can't get at home. A great first time visit!"}
{"text":"OMG you guys! There's an In-N-Out Burger on the strip!   Well, technically it's \"off the strip\" at the LINQ. This is like an open air shopping and dining area and it is totally on the strip.   This place opens at 10:30 in the morning. I showed up at 11am and I was order number 76. These guys knock out orders hardcore from open to close. Ain't no doubt your food is fresh.  The burger is absolutely perfect. The fries operate well as a side without upstaging the burger. This place changes my life every time I have it.  Cancel all your fine dining reservations and go to In-N-Out Burger instead."}
{"text":"It's IN N OUT good...that's what I use to praise other food places that's really good. So that says it all. ANIMAL STYLE!!!"}
{"text":"Usual In n Out location. This one does get extremely busy (even for their locations) but they keep the lines moving, the foods consistent and there's plenty of parking. For some reason they misplaced our food near the ice cream machine so we had to wait 40 minutes for our food (when it should have been 15-20ish) but they apologized and gave us a free milkshake for the mistake without us complaining. Helped make up for the error. If you want cheap, delicious food this is the place!"}
{"text":"Conveniently at the Linq to satisfy your post day club drunchies. Sober or not, definitely a must when you're on the west coast!   Cheeseburger, well done fries - animal style. Don't forget the peppers!"}
{"text":"This is very much a review of this location and not the chain.   It would be nice if the busy periods where they have an order taker outside was done with a bit more courtesy,\"what do you want\"  wouldn't be it. Small enough to ignore but add in the fact diet soda has never been root beer, my kids hamburger with only ketchup/tomato now = cheeseburger.Nice one.   Also these have to be the worst travelling burgers re their heat retention. I live pretty close and it wasn't remotely as good as eating it right there, e.g, 3 minutes is a long time in the desirability of this food.   So that's 1 order, 3 things wrong it's like they think they are fricking Wendy's or something:)"}
{"text":"Always fast, delicious and inexpensive. I love me some In-N-Out!! I love that I can order some delicious vegetarian grilled cheese and fresh made fries. Thanks for being so awesome!! But please start making your cheese from REAL cheddar cheese."}
{"text":"The combo is the same price if you were to choose all ala carte. Fresh ingredients. Long line for both inside and drive thru had me expecting for an above average burger experience."}
{"text":"Cheap prices, quality food, nice service...your standard In-N-Out.  That drive-thru wait when you're hungry though."}
{"text":"Best value burger Convenient location  Clean and friendly. Not as crowded as California branches"}
{"text":"What's not to love in this place? You could customize your orders. Service is always excellent. Burgers and fries are always good. Yummm!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the greatest burger place in existence.  PLEASE open in the Chicago area!  P-L-E-A-S-E!!!!"}
{"text":"When it comes to your semi fast food/hamburger joints....look no further!! Simply one of the best in my opinion (insert jack in the box here), all the time!  Double double??? yes please!!!"}
{"text":"Second time being to an In-N-Out, and the first time checking out this location.   Service: Took about 5 minutes from the time we ordered to get our food. Have never had an issue with timeliness here, they have a small army working in the kitchen including somebody just cutting onions. Very efficient.   Dining Environment: We opted to eat outside and quickly changed our minds. There was bird poop on a couple of the benches, and none of them looked like they had been cleaned recently. We moved inside and several tables were not clean as well. Note that this was around 4:15, so it was between rushes.   Food: Ordered the Double-Double, fries, and a drink. Very reasonably priced. They put a lot of sauce on the burger at this location, which I appreciate. Food tasted better than my last visit, but I don't remember the lettuce looking anywhere near this bad. Nearly inedible, so I chose to take a picture. Definitely doesn't look like how they advertise their lettuce.   Overall: If you need a quick bite to eat at a cheap price, this place gets the job done, but the food quality can definitely vary."}
{"text":"Had what I believe is my first In -N- Out Burger ever for lunch. Had the Double-Double burger with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles - and a side of fries.  Good, greasy, beefy burger goodness! Such a yummy, messy burger!"}
{"text":"First of all, this isn't really fast food.  Even when the lines are short, it still takes forever to get your meal.  Faster than a place like five guys (since people like making comparisons to it) but not exactly true fast food.  If you like \"normal\" burgers, then these burgers are pretty darn good.  \"Normal\" being cheese, special sauce, lettuce, tomato, onions.  Cheese melts well.  Beef is juicy.  Vegetables are fresh.  I'm not a fan of raw onions though.  Thankfully, they'll ask if you want onions each time.  However I much prefer \"specialty\" burgers over \"normal\" burgers.  Things like sourdough bread, onion straws, blu cheese, barbecue sauce, guacamole, and bacon are what I like.  In-n-out has none of these things as they maintain their 50s era vibe.  The fries are absolutely vile.  They have a weird glaze of vegetable oil on them.  They don't taste like potatoes; they simply taste like crystallized vegetable oil.  I simply abhor shoestring fries.  You can put as much junk on them as you want (\"animal style\") and they'll still be nasty.  I would also like to point out the douchebaggery of the \"secret menu\".  News Flash: it's not a secret.  You aren't cool."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 4 stars if it wasn't for the fries.  The fries are horrible.  It doesn't taste like potato.  They taste like dry grease.  Which is what they are.  I actually avoid this place because of the fries.  There is nothing they could do with the burger that could make up for how disgusting the fries are.  The burger is pretty decent though.  Good meat and the cheese is usually melted.  Decent price.  I've never understood the hype on this place.  I'd pick Jack In The Box over In-n-out any day of the week."}
{"text":"*Mine & the Kid's- Cheese Burger w/ Grilled & Raw Onions. *His- Double-Double protein style.  I don't even know if I should leave anymore of a review, if you haven't had In-N-Out yet, you must've been living under a rock!!!  The only bad thing about this location are the street outlets. One-Way & No Left-Turns... Poopy for you, and I can say this because I am not one of you, crazy-scardy-cat-female-drivers!!!   Drive safe & Eat good!"}
{"text":"I've become an In 'n Out fan over the years, and my love for this establishment grows every month. I say \"month\" because I eat a burger maybe about once a month at most. The drive through line was ridiculously congested on a Tuesday night at around 8pm. I think there were about 20 cars in front of me. So crazy. Whatever, it was worth the wait. At the end of the day, all that matters is that yummy cheeseburger with grilled onions was in mah belly."}
{"text":"My suggestions for In-N-Out:  1) Secret menu -- Just Google it.  2) Grilled cheese for those who don't like hamburgers 3) Two by two, animal style, no special sauce, add hot peppers (for those that do like hamburgers and onions.) 4) Fries well done -- It is an experience. That's all I'm going to say. 5) Milkshakes are meh and super fatty. I usually get the strawberry lemonade.  I hope that helps.  And why three stars, you may ask? It's a regular old burger place, which makes it \"A-OK\" in my book. If In-N-Out offered a vegetarian burger and/or better fries, then they would be in the 4-5 star range. Alas, In-N-Out does not."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is a classic burger stop.  Mainly over on the west coast, people swear by it and often claim this is the best burger in the country.    I am not one of those.  And I am not  a hater.  I enjoy their burgers, in fact I try to stop by whenever I am in an area that has one.    What's sets INO apart is its \"animal style\" aka Thousand Island Sauce.  You get it on your burger, you can get it on your fries.  Whatever.  It \"enhances the taste\" but to me it's all gimmick.  The INO patty is bland with no flavoring (ie ketchup, sauce, etc) it's awfully boring.  The fries are bland as well.    You all probably think I am being unreasonable, but tell me otherwise.  All the people taking about juices from the burger....I feel the patties are too small to begin with you the \"juiciness\" will be limited unless you go double-double or 4x4.  INO is fun, INO is crowded, INO is landmark...but it is also is over-rated.  Good burgers not the best."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 Service: 4/5 Cleanliness: 4/5 Decor & Style: 3/5  As far as taste it's the same as most In-N-Outs, amazing Double double with onions. Location is not as clean as others but it will do. Restrooms could be more updated and cleaned more often as well.  Lines are longer here, probably because it's Vegas!  Would be back if I'm near the area."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 Service: 4/5 Cleanliness: 5/5 Decor & Style: 4/5  Yet another great IN-N-OUT location. This particular location is slightly slow compared to the others i've been to (at least 50 others, I lived in California for 15 years), however, same great taste and affordable menu items. Keep em' comin'!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna be one of those people who say they don't eat fast food......  But really when I lived 3 blocks from in n out I was getting a double double once a week. I'm from the east coast and we have amazing sandwiches you can't get out west, but as far as burgers go nothing compares. How does in n out make every burger so damn perfect?   It's clean, happy and bright inside, everyone who works at this location is so nice, my food never takes longer than 5 minutes (and since I get it to go I always finish it in the car before I'm even home then immediately need to take a nap)."}
{"text":"I come to this location often because my job is so close by. I love in & out! Food wise 5 stars for sure! Today though I have to say the service wasn't what I'm use to here. It took about 15 min to get my food, which is understanding because they're always busy! But what really got me was the 2 people who ordered AFTER me got their food before me. And one of them ordered way more than I did! I asked about my order & was looked at like I was dumb, but then it still took another 5 min to get my food. I ordered a #2- he other 2 orders that went out before mine were multiple burgers. Pretty bummed about the service hoping it's just an off day for them."}
{"text":"We stop here everytime we are in town to visit my brother-in-law.  We don't have these back home and we love their burgers and fries."}
{"text":"The best time to go is around 4pm during the week, it's not too crowded and you can actually get a place to sit inside. The burgers are always great here. Double double, protein style, animal style! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Just what I expected it to be Delicious  A double extra sauce and animal fries with a extra large pink lemonade.. Lunch was love definitely will be returning on pay day"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the drive through today and everyone seemed so pleasant up until the meeting of the manager.  We ordered 13 doubles and got only 12.  Our total of the order about $62.  After counting our food we explained to the girl at the drive through we did not receive 1 burger.  She said ok and let her manager know. The manager (female blonde) then asks us to check our bags again. What??? Why?? I did!! They should have checked the bags first! She made it clear she had my cheeseburger in her hand and would not give it to me until I checked my bags. Totally making us feel like we were trying to steal 1 burger after all we paid.  Absolutely by far the worst customer service. We also asked for ketchup and they have us none. So terrible."}
{"text":"You know a place is good when the line for burgers is out the door. There's 3 burgers to choose from and the menu is so simple which is a win for indecisive people like me. It was my first time having their burgers and I was blown away. The burger was juicy and delicious. I would totally come back for a cheap bites to eat."}
{"text":"I love me some In-n-Out and the wifey and I always seem to stop at this location when in or passing through Phoenix!  It's all that you can expect from an In-n-Out except for the fact that this location is always packed.  There are other locations but I guess, with this spot being close to I-10, it's the easiest to grab the famous burger.  So if you're headed here expect a wait but the crew is pretty fast and won't leave you waiting too long."}
{"text":"What's not to love about In-N-Out? They are consistent with their delicious burgers, fresh cut fries and thick shakes. The employees are fast and friendly. And if there's a line, it moves pretty quickly.   So why not give them 5 glowing stars? At this location only, I seem to always get a cashier who looks confused when I order. I always get a 2x1 (two patties with one cheese) animal style with raw onions instead of grilled. It never fails that the cashier always looks at me with a confused expression. When I explain myself, he or she ALWAYS says \"so you want a double double.\" No, I don't want 2 pieces of cheese! That's why I ordered a 2x1. How is it that I know how to order it and I don't even work there?   Despite this small snafu, everything else is peachy! I'll continue to dine at this location whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place STAYS busy and you will always have to wait on them.  I love their burgers and I really think it's good quality meat.  Went through the drive-thru today that had 12 cars waiting easy and the In-n-out employee came to my car to take my order.  Some secrets you have to know about In-n-out... they have animal style which includes grilled onions and mushrooms, and they have protein style which is with no bun just lettuce.  My favorite is the double-double protein style.  So good and the service is great and honeslty they are pretty fast as well!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed. I had very high hopes for this place. We came over about 11:30 at night, and our Uber driver said that this location stays packed all day and night. So of course I thought we'd have great munchie food .... Nope.   The hamburger was just ok. And their homemade fries were just ok. ... Am I missing something?    Well it definitely didn't cure my munchies. Rush's in Columbia, SC has them beat by a mile    At least I got to try one of their burgers. It was on my Bucket List. Now I can cross it off and move on. ..."}
{"text":"Didn't think there was too much to say about a fast food restaurant but recently after I left the drive thru I realized they fave me the wrong drink. When I called the # on my receipt, it went to a call center   and she wanted to send me a certificate for free burger, fries and a drink for my inconvenience. Then a week later, I actually got a call to make sure I got my certificate! Now that's great customer service!"}
{"text":"This is place will forever be busy no matter what time of the day . But I truly do enjoying eating here when ever I get the chance . 100% would recommend eating here ."}
{"text":"What's the first thing you have to eat when you're on the west coast? In-n-Out!  My bf and I were staying at the LinQ and lucky for us, In n Out was right next to the hotel. As expected the lines can get very long, but that's no surprise considering it's 1 of 2 locations on the Strip (I believe).   As for my opinion of the food, it's very overhyped. I've had better burgers elsewhere. We had the animal style fries and that was really disappointing. It came out lukewarm and just tasted like mayo and cheese splattered over fries... which I guess is what it essentially is but I digress.   My only wish is for this location to be open 24/7. It's on the Strip, after all!"}
{"text":"Typical in and out . The drivethru is always packed I suggest going inside ! Order is correct and they move quick .  Always get your fries well done ! You won't regret it"}
{"text":"Ok, I get it now. I must order my burger animal style to really enjoy it. It tastes so much better that way!!! Second, the shakes taste better when mixed (I.e strawberry and vanilla together)! They are definitely rich and thick and it's hard to have room for them after eating a burger and fries. The food is cheap, service was attentive but the lines...oh the lines."}
{"text":"Ok, so our 2nd time frequenting an In-N-Out and I liked it better than the 1st but I still prefer Five Guys!    What I don't understand is the 10+ vehicle deep line at about every one we pass by. This location was no exception. I get it, sometimes if you have a sleeping infant or too many kids or you're on crutches, the drive thru makes sense. However when the drive thru line is longer than the line inside, park your car, walk inside and try to burn off all the calories you're about to consume.   We parked, walked in, ordered immediately and had our food within 5-10 minutes. I liked the option of sitting outside.   The food is good but greasy. I'd eat it any day over other fast food chains because it tastes fresher. But I still prefer the fries cooked in peanut oil at Five Guys and the numerous topping options.   This was a good location if you bypass the ridiculously long drive thru line."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is a staple \"fast-food\" joint and one on a league of its own. I always order a cheeseburger ($2.50) here with a variety of onions. I love that you can choose from grilled whole/chopped onions to raw whole/chopped onions. There's many secret menu items to customize these simple burgers they offer. Also, they are known for their dressing and they're so sweet about giving them to you. It's really just thousand island, but it makes all the difference in your burger and fries."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to the institution that is In-N-Out Burger back in the early 90s while visiting family in California. I remember being fascinating by the incredibly long drive-thru lines, wondering why so many people would flock here for a burger when there's a less crowded McDonald's and Burger King located just across the street.  Then I tasted the food. And even at the ripe old age of nine, this kid in his neon-colored clothing and knee-high tube socks, immediately understood why, in terms of sheer quality alone, In-N-Out will always remain a cut above the rest.  Fast forward twenty five years. My girlfriend and I stopped by a nearby In-N-Out recently. One of many visits I've made since I first moved to Phoenix nine years ago. And guess what?   Nothing has changed.  The menu is identical to what it was many years ago. There are no \"promotional\" items, gimmicks, or over-the-top attempts to lure in millenials with marketing buzzwords like \"grass-fed\" or \"locally sourced.\" The store layout remains that of a traditional fast food restaurant. There are no big screen HDTVs, IKEA-ish furniture, or coffee bars used as a desperate attempt to stay relevant in present day culture. Because guess what? Unlike every other fast food chain, In-N-Out doesn't have to.  Sure, the prices might have gone up slowly over the years due to inflation, but that's to be expected. Unlike all of its lackluster competitors that offer so many items that many aren't even listed on the menu, In-N-Out's choices remain exactly the same as they've always been. They'll never change - nor should they. It's part of why they appeal to so many people. And as long as they continue to remain a private business that doesn't cater to shareholders, I never expect this to change.  The burgers are delicious, make no mistake about that. Is it the best burger you'll ever try? It's difficult to say. There are \"premium\" burger places out there that cater to a whole other realm. And despite what people might say, In-N-Out is still fast food - and it still isn't good for you. But the fact is, it's fast food that's done extremely well. And in the end, that's really all that matters.  So many of these corporate chains spend millions of dollars on advertising campaigns, commercials, endorsements, and whatever means necessary in order for consumers to buy into their garbage. In-N-Out's advertising is minimal and pretty much debunks virtually everything a marketing professor might spew out at his students.  With In-N-Out, it doesn't matter which location you visit. I've found very little variance in terms of the experience you receive. So my praise isn't so much restricted to this spot only, but practically all In-N-Out locations you might visit. Yes, it's always crowded - and there's a reason as to why.  The bottom line is this: Make great food consistently, establish a simplistic menu of core items, train your employees well, and never change a damned thing - ever!  Corporate chains should take detailed notes.   This is how you do fast food right. Period."}
{"text":"For fast food this place is pretty decent. This was my first In N Out experience. That being said I doubt I'll come back. I'm not much of a fast food eater. I appreciate they use better ingredients than others. I just didn't taste the difference. I prefer thicker fries and my food was pretty cold. I'd go back if my options were limited otherwise I'll keep walking. Not sure what all the hype is about?"}
{"text":"Food quality is on par with other locations.  The drive thru lines can be very lengthy at this location. If you park and go inside to order don't expect to get out faster as it appears drive thru customers get priority and it will still take you forever to get out of the joint for a to go order.   Last 2 Times I visited they did not prepare my meal correctly.   I chalk it up to this location having a very high volume of customers.   This in and out makes fast food feel frustrating and more like it takes 20-25 minutes to get a burger slow food unfortunately."}
{"text":"Great stop at this location of In and Out. This location is right by UNLV campus. I have been to a few locations and this is probably one of the better ones. It is kept clean and the service was quick.   The order three sets of the double double and a cheese burger. All came out within 10 mins and you can tell it was freshly made. The soda refill station was good to get in your soda fix. No complaints.  Lived up to the expectations here. Some of the locations I have been to hosted quiet a big population of homelessness. While you saw some here, it's not as bad as the ones in San Fran."}
{"text":"The burgers here are always served hot, and I had it animal style. The fries are also steaming hot. You do have to wait a few because the food is made to order, but it is well worth it. I wish we had one of these on the East Coast."}
{"text":"I was never a huge fan of In-n-Out til I discovered the secret menu (not so secret menu: http://www.in-n-out.com/secretmenu.asp; super-secret menu: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-N-Out_Burger_menu_items ... on wikipedia. I love it). I don't even eat beef outside of Whole Foods (free range, baby). I'm all about the Animal Fries. I think Animal style would make anything good. I'd make my cat animal style and eat her.   Everything here is fresh, blah blah blah. This is one of their main selling points. But who friggin' cares? Its fast food. Its not supposed to be healthy or anything.   They're open late: 130a on the Vegas weekend.   This is a Christian-owned franchise. Look on the bottom of the soda cups, its says John 3:16. I kind of feel like a hypocrite eating their food. Being a jezebel and all ...   * off the strip, non-casino"}
{"text":"Parking lot can barely accommodate this business.  Maybe I came at a good hour cuz it wasn't cranking there.  Young lady was maintaining the drive thru before you pull up to the speaker to help expidite the transaction. She kept the space to a minimum between car ahead so anyone pulling up wasn't stuck out in the parking lot or on the main thoroughfare. The cashier taking my money was accurate with repeating back our order and we wrapped up that portion of the transaction quickly without any delay. Order pick up was maybe a few minutes better than the usual In N Out Burger experience, but other than that, it's all good. I'll keep this location in mind for the next time I'm out at Camelback Ranch for the shows."}
{"text":"I am confused by folks die hard allegiance to this place and am not that enamored with the secret unpublished way to order ones burger.   It is a clean and friendly, value priced fast-food burger place with a limited menu...The cheeseburger and fries a la \"animal\" were above average in fast food terms.  But I can't image this is really a destination stop for so many visitors."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this last animal style double double I ate. I am not sure if it was because I was starving or if it was as good as I thought it was, but yum. I am not a hundred percent sold on the french fries yet (I still like Five Guys better), but because In N out has milk shakes it pretty much evens things out because I love to dip my frys in my shake! If you haven't gone to in and out burger before.. what rock are you living under? lol"}
{"text":"Of course, everyone loves themselves some In-N-Out Burger!  Service: Quick, efficient service! I always see lines dozens of cars deep, so I have definitely sat in a 20 minute line to satisfy an intense In-N-Out craving before... however we ventured inside this time and had our food within 5 minutes.  Tip: Supposedly you should ask about a secret menu, which entails something called \"Animal Style\", which is a really saucy-grilled-oniony version of the original. So if you like that, go balls to the wall. Apparently you can get your french fries Animal Style too, which actually sounds pretty good.  Location: This particular location was a real mess. Dirty tables everywhere, crap all over the floors. Real shame too, because there were employees just standing around most of the time."}
{"text":"It's a burger. Made to order and everything is fresh and inexpensive.. no complaints from me. Not sure why people complained its a burger place. I'd have it again. The burger was so fresh the burger was hot and the lettuce and tomato was still cool when they served me. Fresh cut fries and a drink for maybe 6 bucks. A ok for me."}
{"text":"I love in n out. Great service great burgers. But I go to the one on stapley and I don't know what time it closes but I get there at 1 29 coming the wrong way so I had to do a u turn to get in as o pulled up my clock turned 1 30. I'm kinda behind another car so I move as close as I can and I say hello. Nothing.  I know they can hear me. Another minute goes by and I'm like are you going to take care of me or not. Then the lights go out. I had to back out of that drive thru and that sucks. I went to ask them really at the door but they seemed to have friends in there waiting for them cause they motioned them as soon as I started to walk away from the door like everything was okay and they could look now.  I manage a restaurant and found it a little rude. They could have just told me they were closed or made me a burger while I was right there anyway."}
{"text":"Awesome Place to eat employees are so friendly and the order is always right."}
{"text":"Super overated! From the long wait in the drive through (I got to witness an accident while waiting due to the overcrowded parking lot)... the double double animal style I got was undercooked and that's hard to do considering its more of a tomato sandwich compared to a hamburger considering how thin the 2 slice of meat were. Thick juicy tomato slices along with plenty of sloppy cheese. But the meat wasnt even worth it. Really all you people that praise this place. I dont get it. Fries were way over salted..But they were fresh cut...LOL. on the bright side, I enjoyed the strawberry milkshake. I tell you what...I'll take Wendy's over this place anyday."}
{"text":"I don't understand what all the hype is about with these burgers.  Yes, they are cheap.  Yes, they cook as you order.  No, they are not flavorful and could use some hamburger seasoning.  The huge onion, even for this ShrekCousin, is just too much in a tiny burger.  AND they're always so packed....WHY?  It's like this side of America has given this joint a big name for no reason that I can understand.  The fresh cut fries are too soft.  Fries are meant to be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with some salt lining the outside, served warm.  The shake was not sweet enough.  I've been here a few times as a suggestion from someone else, so I've given it multiple tries to impress me and it's failed the test each time.  Everytime after eating from this place I'm just not satisfied and would rather eat a hot dog and chips from Circle K with a thirst buster."}
{"text":"This was the first stop that me & my bf made upon arrival to Las Vegas. Originally a CA girl then moved to Chicago..IN-N-OUT is what is missing in my life now!!! :'(   It had been over a year since I had indulged in this glorious burger..but still knew exactly what I wanted w/o even glancing at the menu.   Cheeseburger animal style..no pickles. A side of fries w/ THREE sides of spread. NOM NOM NOM. & yes I used all three sides of spread, initially I thought I only needed 2 and the other one was for the bf, but when I realized he wasn't going to use it I proceeded to slab more spread on my already animal style burger and dipped my fries into it's yummy goodness.  Oh IN-N-OUT...you are truly what a hamburger is all about!"}
{"text":"Ok so my first time at an In-N-Out Burger place. It was pretty good although not as good as people make it out to be. I still think Culver's makes a better burger."}
{"text":"Hungry? Craving in-n-out? Long drive thru line? Do not fear, the in-n-out staff is phenomenal! Honestly though, do not let the long lines fool you...it's worth the wait. What other fast food place do you know that doesn't charge for extra condiments? What's not to love? YAAASSSS in-n-out!"}
{"text":"I feel sometimes I get wrapped up in all the gourmet burgers out there with bacon and cheddar and onion shoe strings and blue cheese and fried egg and the works that you can do. But you know what? Sometimes the simple classic totally can just hit the spot.  In Houston, TX, we don't have an In-N-Out...at least not yet. So being out in this part of the US, we couldn't be just a taxi-ride away from an In-N-Out and NOT go to it. It was totally worth it. I got the regular burger animal style and fries (extra crispy). This time the fries weren't exactly how I wanted them, but the burger totally made up for it.  Simply delicious. :)"}
{"text":"This place is really close to my school so I go their very often! Never a time where it isn't packed but service is always quick and friendly. Everyone that works there is polite and I always get my food in a timely manner without error. Try the neopolitan milkshake you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This In N Out location is one of the best i've ever been to! The lines are quite long, but the workers are quick in getting people's orders down and getting the food out fast!. The couple times i've been to vegas this is the in n out me and my friends go to before heading back to LA"}
{"text":"I don't even eat red meat and I have to give it 5 stars!  Love their grilled cheese with onions, fries, and either a strawberry shake or iced tea.  Low prices, fresh food, and friendly employees.  My favorite fast food place!  Parking lot can be a bit challenging and always crowded.   There is another location at the 101 and Camelback that isn't too far away, but not nearly as crowded."}
{"text":"As usual In-N- Out is amazing for some quick eats W Coast burger style. Menu is basic and that's how a burger joint should be. While McDonald's is trying to serve salads and fresh wraps to please those health freaks. In N Out serves what people want. Fresh delicious burgers. No BS. The shakes here are off the chart. I brought a work friend here who had never experienced In-N-Out and said \"You have to have a shake man\". You see....when you try to slurp it up the straw it's so thick n tasty that once it hits your taste buds your brain waves go haywire. Then the flavour hits and it's like a guitar solo in your mouth.   As we were here for a late morning snack at around 11 AM I had the double cheese and chocolate shake. So good I'll keep coming back when the opportunity rises. It's the shizz."}
{"text":"I've never been to an In-N-Out, I've only seen instagram pics and etc so since I was starving and wanted some fries and decided to expand my beef taste buds (I don't eat beef,but when I do it's only Taco Bell and Five guys) so I went through the drive through since inside was packed. I got my meal and sat in my car and ate thinking with such amazing great reviews I'd have the same experience, but no.   When I got my food it smelled like fish, the fries were okay, not what I was expecting and the burger was okay. The only good thing about the food was you can taste how fresh the lettuce and tomatoes. Also the girl at the drive through was nice, that's about as all the good things I can say. I'm so disappointed, I was really wanting an awesome meal since I didn't feel like driving to a restaurant in old Scottsdale and waiting for my food and being even more hungry. Either way I will not eat In-N-Out ever again, just not my cup of tea lol. I only give two stars to places I will never eat again."}
{"text":"I love the burgers and shakes especially animal style. The service is always great and pretty quick considering it's always busy.  I took my friend who lives in New york and she loved it we ended up going to two locations on her visit.  My only thing is I hate the fries no matter if I get them extra crispy or dip in my shake I can't get used to them.  Fries are my favorite potato and it hurts my soul that I can't eat them here"}
{"text":"Even tho this location is always busy , I always have a great service here.  Food is amazing and he service is awesome and friendly !"}
{"text":"Usually isn't to bad but tonight the burgers and fries were horrible. So disappointed in it!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Service is always great, food always fresh and flavorful. Been a lot of different facilities and have never been let down."}
{"text":"While eating here, my friends claimed that this was the best In-N-Out they have ever had.  I thought it tasted almost the same as every other In-N-Out I have been to.  Don't get me wrong, it was delicious and still highly recommended!  However, I have learned that everything tends to taste much better to people who have been consuming mass amounts of alcohol.  For out-of -towners unfamiliar with In-N-Out, it is a must try!  There menu is simple and excellent.  There are only a few things on the menu, but it is about as good as fast food gets.  They also have a secret menu where you can customize your meal a ton of different ways, but I would suggest that first timers stick to the basics.  I got the #1 combo when I visited here.  It consisted of a Double-Double ( a burger with double meat and cheese), fries, and a fountain drink.  It was not as magical as my friends made it out to be, but it really hit the spot for me and was super tasty.  I am always down for some In-N-Out, and this location did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Vegas and desperate for a quick bite while out on a shopping day we stopped for the old standby......burgers and fries at In-N-Out.  You can surely find a better burger if you're willing to sit down and shell out $12 - $15. But bang for the buck....I'd come here way before I'd drive through one of the traditional fast food chains.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"All the way from Miami, Florida. This made me the happiest person to ever travel so far for a IN'N'OUT BURGER! Came back every night of my stay here in Chandler, Arizona. So delicious and fresh. Beats every burger joint in the US. And the staff were so happy and friendly. Their positive (but not overwhelming) energy put a smile on my face. Not everyone has that kind of attitude 1:30 in the morning, especially not in Miami.    Can't wait to be back in Arizona just for a IN'N'OUT burger  until we meet again."}
{"text":"The best fast food burger joint in the country as far as I'm concerned.  I can't wait until they make their way to Houston...it shouldn't be too long now!"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm normally not a person who would write a review for a chain restaurant, but this was an out-of-body experience for me (my first time!) and it felt worthy of a little praise. Why aren't there In-N-Out's on the east coast? We dig your fresh burgers animal style, too. I would recommend checking out their secret menu online before visiting. At least for me, I felt like less of an idiot and more like I knew what I was doing when ordering. I had a cheeseburger animal style, while my boy ordered a double-double, animal style, with a vanilla milkshake. We split well-done fries with cheese. Personally, I like my fries really crisp, and ordering them well-done was perfect considering cheese on top has a tendency to make them more soggy. They were awesome, and the cheeseburgers were probably the best I've ever had from a fast-food joint! The milkshake was good, but not outstanding (I'm not a huge milkshake fan, though). We really loved the whole experience, enough that I considered visiting again the next day. Decided my arteries couldn't handle it, so we will continue to dream of In-N-Out until our next west coast romp... sigh."}
{"text":"Oh come on. 5 stars. This is merely a formality. In-N-Out is the greatest fast food place of all time, and this location is no different. A line of cars wrapping around the building, out to the street. We still couldn't have waited in line any longer than 10 minutes. They whipped us (and our cab driver - thank you!) through the line in no time, with the outside order-taker helping immensely. She had no problem with the special orders (Tip: try the chopped chilis - incredible on a burger!)  I'm not usually one for buying into aura as much as I am just the food, but this place has something special about it. It's nearly a badge of honor to order something on their \"secret\" menu. But if the food sucked, nothing would save it. Thankfully, In-N-Out is the real deal, and goddamn it now I'm hungry."}
{"text":"Greatest Burgers!!!! And don''t forget to ask about the secret hidden menu items!"}
{"text":"King of the west coast, nothing beats the quality and price of in n out which is why i hail this burger mecca as one of the best! Where can you find a burger joint where all the ingredients are fresh, you can see the workers make the food while you wait for it in the drive thru and a secret menu to make you feel so exclusive you little hipster you!  In n  out doesn't need an extensive menu with new burgers and meals coming out every month.  They stick with a very simplistic menu which i respect a lot.  They know burgers.   This particular location is no different in taste from the other in n outs which is good.  I've been to probably all of the different locations and consistency in taste and service is unrivaled.  I always get the same order which is the #1 double double animal style with chopped chilis, extra toasted bun, no salt in the burger or fries and if i'm feeling it the Neapolitan shake (which is amazing and if you're the adventurous time, dip your fries in it).  Orders come out pretty quickly considering the volume of customers.   Coke products are available and their pink lemonade is awesome.  Nice and tart! I like to fill about 3/4 of my cup with sprite and finish it off with some pink lemonade.  When you order is done, they'll call your number and here is where you can enhance your meal even more.  ASK FOR SPREAD! its the special sauce they put in their burgers and i like putting extra and adding it to the fries! Also ask for a fork so eating the fries with the sauce isn't messy.  They have chilis by the condiments section, add these to the fries as well.   Overall, one of the best quick bites that doesn't compromise quality with speed.  **At this location, the local bums like to hangout at the outside seating section so be careful  ***Also, bacon was rumored to be added but this was an April fools joke :)"}
{"text":"In-n-out has been on my wish list for many, many years but living on the east coast, I have never had the chance to try one out.  So my bachelor party was in Vegas and my one (main) request was that we eat here.  After a roughly 10 minute über ride from the strip, my wish was granted.  The inside of the building is very plain with little to no decor.  The menu is very small, with maybe 3-5 total items.  This isn't a problem though, as it probably helps with how quickly they're able to process each order.   I had a Double Double, regular fries and a drink.  The burger was excellent.  Bun was soft and spongy and the meat was juicy, tender and flavorful just as I had been told.  This burger definitely lives up to the hype.  I am also a fan of Shake Shack and his was comparable to their offerings.   The fries were kind of blah.  Nothing special, thin-cut fries just dropped in a fryer and served.  I tried a couple of my friend's animal fries and they were a little better but still did not meet my expectations.   All in all, I would eat here if given the choice in the future.  But if I had to chose between In-n-out and Shake Shack, SS would definitely win."}
{"text":"Get it Mustard Grilled.   In N Out! nothing can be said that hasn't already. EAT, LOVE, EAT."}
{"text":"Im very picky with my burger condiments... I dont like Mayo/thousand island based sauces and not a big fan of mustard+ketchup on my burger.  BBQ sauce and A1 are usually the only ones I'll use on a burger but most places use nasty cheap bbq sauce and dont offer A1.  So at many places I'll have my burger \"plain\" with no sauce which I believe has given me a ton of experience of what places are serving legit burgers that dont taste dry and flavorless without  sauce smeared on it... And In N Out is king at that regards. Their patties are made so juicy and flavorful you can easily eat it without their spread. I dont like their fries but the burgers are so good and at such a good price I dont mark down my rating for that.  Also their shakes are some of the most affordable I've seen.  And lol at all the haters from the east coast who obviously had their mind made up that In N Out cannot possibly be better than their local favorites before trying them.  As a burger fan Ive tried countless places including favorites from other regions without like shake-shack and Five Guys that I enjoy and visit too.  Is In N Out my absolute favorite burger?  No but its one I keep coming back to the most for their convenience and unparalleled bang for buck ratio."}
{"text":"Been to this location many times. The staff is always fast no matter how busy they are. Always a short wait time after you order. Getting a seat is a different story because they're always so busy."}
{"text":"With the exception that they should have made this one twice as big (you can hardly find a seat around noon) I've never once had a wrong order and sometimes I order some complex stuff. Employees are like, overly happy which is actually sometimes annoying, but oh well. But yeah, In N Out hardly even needs a review... everyone knows the food is always incredible.  And Amanda B is right! There used to be a little green house that was on this lot before they finally gave in."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing but its just so busy round the clock I never feel like eating after waiting 30 minutes"}
{"text":"Ate here today. I was working for a clinic in the area and needed something close as I only had 30 minutes for lunch. I was amazed at how busy this restaurant was. Matter of factly this whole shopping center is a bees nest of activity. I was concerned that I wouldn't make it back to work in the allotted time. It took 15 minutes to get my order mind you there were probably around 40+ people eating, waiting or contemplating placing an order.   When I got back to work my area, I opened the bag to find a well prepared burger just as I ordered it. The fries were hot and salted well. I wish I would of taken the employees offer of catsup for my fries as it would of made my meal perfect. I will definitely return when I'm working in the area."}
{"text":"Well In-N-Out burger you have one hell of a burger... I have been eating at this location for years and never had a bad meal I want to go get it right now as I write this... Many might not know about the secret menu I put this to the test my last visit and sure enough they knew about it all. So on you next visit you will have a whole new experience... Try this site for new menu options: http://www.badmouth.net/in-n-outs-secret-menu/   I was happy I did we were able to order a Neapolitan shake it rocked and the Animal Style Fries off the chart... You need to do everything Animal Style anyways... Great burger place I will be back many times I know it."}
{"text":"Look, this place is always yummy and it's open late. Next time I'm going to do a cheese burger, animal style with peppers."}
{"text":"Tried the new location on the Strip, there was a very long line but we moved through in about 10 min. Food was great as usual, Fast and Friendly service as well."}
{"text":"same story as the ones in cali. long line , but this one took seriously about 1/2 to get thru the drive thru."}
{"text":"My Favorite burger place!! I get double double animal style, protein style, with chopped chilies! Instead of fries I get a Flying Dutchman.  This location is close to the galleria mall area of Henderson, NV. It is very clean and staff is polite, clean, and very courteous!  My kids love the grilled cheese and fries! And their shakes are On Point."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is about consistency, and they achieve that at this chain as well. No surprise here. Employees are responsive, efficient, and loud. The doors are always revolving at this chain. And why ever not? The location is near the strip, a meal at In N Out is super tasty and very affordable compared to whatever overpriced meal you'd find on the strip. We came during lunch and were order #14. By the time we ate our meal, they surpassed #14 once more and were on order #2. They were that busy. When you first enter the joint, it may look like you need to jump on the next available table while you're in line. But the turnover is fast. Tables become available readily.   You can ask for extra (packaged) spread if you're really into their sauce. And the chili peppers are self service. As a tip, expand the white paper container so you can hold more chili peppers. They are meant to be expanded if needed.  Make sure to visit the merchandise store across this joint. There are only 2 in the nation!"}
{"text":"This buger joint is a must. Whenever I'm on the west coast!! Was out there recently on vacation. Had some family members who had never had their burgers and my brother got up for seconds! Double double! LOL!!!"}
{"text":"Burger Well done that's all I can say. Everything was on point from taste to speed of order. GREAT place to catch a quick bite before hitting the strip."}
{"text":"They were just okay. It was my first time having In-N-Out and I was not blown away at all. They were just plain regular burgers. Their animal style fries were good but nothing to rave about. I thought that their price was really inexpensive which is a plus. Their customer service is also a plus because they were all so nice and accomodating. Overall, it's good for what it is."}
{"text":"This place has a special place in heaven, and anyone who works there is garunteed a spot.i have never had a better burger, better fries, better shakes, or better food. I can highly recommend the double-double protein style and animal fries, it would be last meal if I was on death row."}
{"text":"I wish I was in Vegas just so I could eat this again!!! I didn't think it'd be possible to top Shake Shack in NYC but In-N-Out did it for me. Went back in June while I was in Vegas for EDC and it was amazing. From the moment we walked in we knew we were in for a treat. The line was ridiculously long but we already knew about the popularity of this place so we didn't mind. We were lucky to get a table right before we placed our orders. The wait was a bit long but boy was it worth it. BEST BURGER EVER! The West Coast won this one. It was my first time but since I saw everyone getting the famous spread, so did I and wow. It was so good, I slathered it on everything, the fries, the burger, my fingers... I wanted to get two burgers but my friends looked at me like I was bugging so I didn't, and I'm glad because I was really full after just one.  Stop being selfish and bring this to the East Coast already! Until then I'll impatiently wait until the next time I'm in Cali."}
{"text":"After our trip to Ethel M's lighted cactus garden we swung in to get some burgers. I love in-N-out and come to this location since moving to this side of town more frequently. This was the first time I got a double double and animal fries and I am here to tell you both were fantastic. A fun treat.  The line is always w rapped around the building but they are so smart to have someone walking up to cars taking orders which makes a long line bearable. It moved fast and the order was hot and exactly what we ordered. Staff was friendly and read our order back to us.   I recommend trying those darn animal fries...you will be hooked. I just wish they had onion rings"}
{"text":"I am sooo disappointed with this location.  I knew it was a busy location so I wasn't expecting much from the people working because the night we came the drive thru line was slammed with cars.  The line inside wasn't any better, but we. were able to order our food.  Grilled cheese animal style, fries well done.  Double everything in the sandwich.  What made this experience so lackluster was the crazy long wait for our food.   They were cranking all the burgers out and had already called about 15 orders ahead of us.  These were people who came in and ordered after we ordered.  The group of guys who were behind us in line were in their second round of ordering.    It was only after I went to the front counter to follow up on my order did I get an ETA on my food.  What sucked about it was the fact that the guy working was trying to give me a lame ass excuse as to why they called everyone else ahead of my order.   I think they actually forgot because it was pretty obvious when they were scrambling to get my food together. So bummed it couldn't have been a better experience."}
{"text":"My good friend Kevin and I went here to eat.  It was so yummy, but In-N-Out is always good.   We worked all day at the Convention Center and then we sat in a bar drinking some Johnny Walkers, when he said, \"Hey you wanna grab some dinner!\" Well this is Vegas and we always seem to find ourselves in some overpriced fancy restaurant on the strip spending way too much money for food.  In-N-Out was a perfect stop...I wish they would build one on the Strip.  It was fun to go with Kevin because he is a local California guy but he is the first California person to actually teach me something knew about  In-N-Out.  I have known about the secret menu for years but Kevin introduced me to the In-N-Out Hot Peppers...I had no idea we could get these for our burger and they were spicy hot.  I also think I might have taught Kevin something too...but he would not admit it.  He got his fries animal style and I got my fries well done.  We decided that it would have been amazing if we got them well done and animal style for the same order...I can not wait to try that.  The burgers were amazing but that is always a given...they work magic with there food.  Kevin also talked me into getting shakes too...so we had a feast...we also wore our In-N-Out paper hats and emailed photos to all of our friends/co-workers who were stuck in those boring expensive dinner meetings on the strip.  When we met up later at Haze, we were the talk of the party!    In-N-Out rocks!!!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out burger has got to be the best burger out there for the price. I could live off of the double double protien style, no onions.  Yes I am their #1 fan. I even dressed up as an In-N-Out girl for Halloween.  One Halloween my girlfriends and I decided to dress up as fast food girls instead of the usual bunnies, french maids, hookers, dominatrix, pirate wench's, basically the usual excuse for them bitches to dress up as sluts. We had a Krispy Kreme girl, A Hot dog on a Stick girl and me the In-n-Out girl.  I bought my shirt from their souvenir shop next to the restaurant. I also bought my hat, my apron and my larger than life safety pin to hold it all together. The souvenir shop sells it all.  We went out that night and realized that we looked quite normal. My girlfriend got out her scissors and started cutting out our shirts, cutting our shorts shorter. So basically we were Fast Food Whores. I guess Halloween is really the one day of the year it's okay to be a slut.  Sorry bout the rant, I love In-N-Out. 5 stars."}
{"text":"I guess I miss all of the excitement and hype to a hamburger place that serves crappy french fries. The burgers were okay at best, good price but hamburgers nothing special in my book not worth my time and effort. french fries were  about as good as the cardboard they came in I guess it must be a if you have a midnight munchies thing ."}
{"text":"Late night munchies after watching the Tony Awards.  Had a hard time understanding the girl's voice on the speaker box, and finally realized after getting our order that she had asked us if we were eating in our car, when I thought she had asked if we were using a card.  I had the double cheese burger with onions and the chocolate milk shake.  My wife had the cheeseburger all the way and fries.  Asked the girl at the window for catsup, mustard and mayo, and she said they did not have mayo but she would give us catsup and mustard.  Got the tray (reason for the question about the car?) and realized after pulling off that she had not given us the catsup and mustard, so we stopped at a convenience store and got mayo and mustard (they didn't have catsup) and paid more for that than the burgers.  Burgers, fries and shake were tasty but we both were surprised after our first visit to an IAO that the menu was so limited.  However, hunger satisfied and now we know."}
{"text":"This place is great. Not only is the food fresh, fast and tasty, but, you get a strong feeling that all of the employees truly enjoy working there. I grew up in the era of the carhop/malt shop burger and this brought back at least a glimmer of that."}
{"text":"After years of hearing people talk about In-N-Out and going to Vegas a million times, I finally tried it.  I was so excited to finally see what the hype was all about.  Boy was I let down.  The burger was absolutely tasteless.  What is the point of going to a burger place and having a tasteless burger.  Who cares that you put a bunch of crap on it that tastes good if the burger is bland?  I don't care, i can tall you that.  I can't believe people love this place.  I am guessing they have never been to Johnny Rockets, Fat Burger, Shake Shack or anywhere else with a great fast food burger.  Boo to this place.  I'd rather eat a piece of cardboard with a bunch of sauce and cheese and crap on it."}
{"text":"Green tasty burgers yummy french fries cut from actual potatoes I really like that they use peanut oil their shakes are unmatched and if you were going to get a burger go animal style"}
{"text":"Not sure why this is highly rated by others.  Food took 10 minutes to arrive.  Burgers were tasty, but no better than a McDonalds hamburger for much higher.  French fries were ok.  No better than anywhere else.    You are better off going to Five Guys or Fudruckers for a good burger."}
{"text":"Yummy but nowhere to sit which is super frustrating since all you want to do is sit down and stuff your face! BUT...This is a hot spot for tourist so be ready to have to wait to for seating if you plan to eat inside, and by wait I mean hover awkwardly while making creepy eye contact with those no longer eating but still maintaining a table in hope that they get the unspoken message that it's time for them to vacate.   InandOut if you are reading this, looking into expansion. No one will eat outside in 110+ degree heat. Your customers would greatly appreciate that."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Never had better, also the food was phenomenal. I've never been to this chain before and was pleasantly surprised. Will definitely pick this over McDonald's if I have a choice!"}
{"text":"Classic 1950's burger joint.  Burgers, fries (made fresh while you wait), soda and shakes.   That's it a pure and great tasting burger shop.  Employees are friendly and upbeat.   Clean restaurant, great atmosphere and maybe the best value for a good tasting burger and fries anywhere."}
{"text":"Fast food taken seriously Incredible service and staff make just great simple no nonsense burgers with French fries to match. No wonder there is always a line, well deserved."}
{"text":"Best In-n-out Burger restaurant in the valley. I eat here all the time and the food is always perfect. Great service every time. Even when there is a line it moves rather quickly. Even if you have to wait a few minutes it is well worth it. I highly recommend eating here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I must have gone on a bad day because the fries tasted like cardboard.  The burger weren't all that.  Been there once and never went back. Maybe one day I will give it another try!"}
{"text":"By far the best fast food burger place along with shake shack. I'm not as much of a huge fan of the fries though they are awesome when ordered animal style.  Only reservation I have about this Vegas location in particular is that they messed up my order and were not willing to correct it unless I paid. Quite odd for a chain that well known. Otherwise I would have given them 5 stars."}
{"text":"I love cheeseburgers period!  The fresher the better!  We don't have an In 'n Out in Hawaii so when I come to Vegas, this burger joint is guaranteed on my to do list.    When we pulled up to the drive through, I ordered a double double burger animal style with some fries and an iced tea.  I was curious to know why they called it animal style and from what I hear they use some kind of thousand island dressing which is added to the burger upon request.    The burger was yummy, however, I'm not a big fan of their shoe string fries.  I'm more of a crinkle fries kind of gal.  But any type of fries will do when pairing it with a burger.     Overall, the service was quick and the employees were friendly but most importantly the food made my tummy happy.  I would definitely come back to this location again."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Phoenix to live with my boyfriend I asked him to take me to In-N-Out since everyone seems to love this chain so much. When we went I just got a regular burger and my boyfriend got an animal style one, my boyfriend also mentioned that their fries are kinda soggy and gross so we ordered them well done.  Anyways my excitement quickly diminished when I took my first bite, I was just like, \"Ew this is what all the excitement's about?\", I was starting to wonder if people in the west have never had a decent burger!  My burger was boring and just whatever, I've had better fast food. My BF's tasted like burnt mustard, pretty gross. The fries apparently were a lot better well done but still totally bland..they tasted like something you could get from the freezer section at any grocery store.  Other than that the place was kinda dirty, maybe we got there after a rush, but the employees were all super nice!  Maybe I'll go and give them another try sometime..but I'm hesitant."}
{"text":"Cheers to the hoopla experience. Been here, did it, not buying the t-shirt though. It's your average grease burger, the taste is not exceptional, but the experience for my mini me was worth it.   We had the double, it's a huge burger, lots of trimmings, but no pickle. The fries were marginal. If you are a southerner skip the tea its unsweet.  It is a good value for the price. But it was a once in a lifetime experience for me."}
{"text":"In-N-Out only tastes good in California, I've heard, and our visit to this Arizona location has proven the conventional wisdom.   The staff was very friendly and efficient, though, just like California."}
{"text":"Do In-N-Out shops even need reviews? I think that if you can't appreciate a great burger in America from a self-made family business success story, you should check yourself for communist ties.   This burger chain has been around for decades and I have never been to one that does not have a crowd with lines at the counter and cars backed up at the drive through. Be persistent though and you will be rewarded with a quality, well put together burger that tops just about every other fast food burger chain out there.   This particular store has a separate merchandise shop and it is a fairly large property with more tables inside and out than a typical In-N-Out. There were also more parking spots and on the weekday afternoon I visited, the lines were manageable and my wait time from ordering to stuffing my pie hole was only about 10 minutes.  This location is close to The Strip so I imagine that there are times where the crowds and the wait are going to be terrible but the employees here seemed to be happy to be working and even came around a few times asking if they could get us anything else and clearing away our detritus and debris after the burger mauling that took place at our table. That kind of service I have not seen previously at other In-N-Outs so maybe they are trained to do that to keep people a bit happier while they have to wait. I did observe several locals that were very social with those of us visiting and they were all very proud of this particular location and they were really selling some foreign visitors on the food and the culture. Vegas should sign these people up as marketing ambassadors. I think by the end of the wait, the Japanese tourists patiently trying to hear their order number called were ready to denounce their own citizenship and move here based on the sales job from the local guy in line!   I'm sure the waits can be long here as they are at almost every other In-N-Out I have ever been to but the comforting reward of their burger in my hot little hand is worth it every time."}
{"text":"The hype is a little over played but the food is always on point. As many as they serve a day and get there food out as fast as they do is a very good place. Always on my mind"}
{"text":"I love me some In-N-Out!  Being a native Californian that's only been in LV for 3 years now, going to In-N-Out reminds me of home. The quality of their hamburgers are amazing and you can't beat their fresh cut fries. In my biased opinion, In-N-Out is the best fast food burger and fries by far.  This location, like every other I have been to, is well keep up, clean and has friendly, helpful staff.  Try it animal style if you haven't before."}
{"text":"Finish this sentence:  Whenever I visit ___________, I have to eat at ___________.    While I don't consider myself an UBER-foodie (yet, lol), I can say that there is one thing all food lovers share in common. We have a running list of blanks to fill in.  In-N-Out seems to be on many a lists for those of us who don't live near one.  While I am not giving them a 4* rating necessarily for the food, I do admire and appreciate the concept:  - A simple burger. (I am all about simple burgers.) - Fries. (Crispy. Shoestring. Crispy (yes, I said it twice for emPHAsis)) - Drinks. (Bottomless.) - Shakes.  (Only when I've worked out during the day.)  That's it. Good food. A value can't be beat.   INO, I can't wait to see you again!"}
{"text":"Solid burger and fries. Tough to get seating but overall lived up to expectations."}
{"text":"Theirs burgers are so delicious and made to order. Their fries have gone down in quality through the years but I'll still eat them. I don't like them animal style.. just the regular way is fine with me"}
{"text":"I love in and out but I'm huge on customer service. This locations has the worst customer service ever. Felt rushed to order told us the total before we were even done ordering had to tell her we weren't done then we get to the pay window and the guy mumbles the total no life in him what so ever. My sister turns to me and says I am never coming to this in and out again looking at all the employees on the inside \"this in and out sucks all the employees look miserable\" do something with your employees make sure they are happy working it makes the guest happy as well. Coming from someone who works in customer service also. Guest come first and they like seeing employees happy as well"}
{"text":"Two words for ya! ANIMAL STYLE. The menu here is very simple. It hasn't changed since it opened in the early 1900's. Nothing but burgers, fries and shakes made from the freshest ingredients! My meal of choice: Double Double, Animal Style with fries and a Lemon-Up (or root beer).   This burger joint is NOT a franchise, it's family owned, so you are getting way better customer service and quality food than you'll find at McD's or BK! There's nothing gourmet about an In-n-Out burger, they are just so damn tasty! Only downside is that they're only on the west coast! Sorry East coast!"}
{"text":"Stale and cold French fries. Okay burger. Won't come back to this or any In-N-Out burger again. I'm not sure why the lines are always so long."}
{"text":"Have aten at InnOut Burger several times but the quality just seems to be getting worse. The burger was much sloppier than usual and despite their paper wrapping and best efforts, dripped all over our jackets, most likely permanently staining them.  The fresh cut fries were ok - but were a bit too greasy for my taste.  Back to the burger. It was my impression these were fresh but it didn't quite taste like it.  And it was already a bit cold - not sure why.  However, the toppings seemed fresh. While I have always liked InNOut Burger, I think I will probably pass on it in the future as my last two visits have not lived up to prior experiences."}
{"text":"Its a tradition to hit the In and OUT in Vegas before going home. Whether you lost $$$, lost your mind, or just got lost. These burgers make everything happy again. Thank You In and Out."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the hype is about. The meat is so thin. The fries are tasteless. But that's what you get for a fast food place. There are plenty of other places that make delicious burgers. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and fries. Super friendly service, and a clean eating establishment. Did I mention the burger's are awesome? Fries are super tasty as well. In my grand rating of Burger joints I've visited... In-N-Out is greater than Five Guys is greater than Steak and Shake is greater than Shake Shack."}
{"text":"Everyone told us we had to go here so we tried it. The place was packed but the service was pretty good. The smell of grease was pretty strong so we decided to eat outside. The burgers were very tasty and the French fries were great. Least expensive meal we had all week."}
{"text":"Awesome burger and fresh hot fries all the time!  Other fast food burger joints are a gamble, especially thru the drive thru."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed. I don't eat red meat much anymore so I was looking forward to this double double burger but the meat was do small and thin, I thought I was eating a grilled cheese sandwich. Two thumbs down for In-N-Out. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Busy tues lunchtime! Many hs kids , seniors , et al. No seats packed but line & food moving quickly . The drive thru lane very long. The workers very friendly . I didn't think the fries were up to the standard As i remembered , but I ate them all! Jk"}
{"text":"American burger and fries. Always busy from inside, outside and drive through. Everything is freshly made. Appreciated them giving us their paper hats for fun!"}
{"text":"How can you say a bad thing about this place? Went here to satisfy a burger craving the other night and they are the only place that gets my crazy order correct. I usually get a DoubleDouble with cheese, Animal & Protein Style, extra Onions. The drive thru is usually long, but moves at a good pace. Tip: If you are going to go through the drive-thru and stop by the tree on the left with all the birdies happily chirping their beaks off, ROLL UP your windows  cause they gifts of their own to share."}
{"text":"Always right, every time. Best burger. Best taste. Best quality. I have been coming here for 12 years and have never been disappointed. Not once. If you haven't had in n out I suggest you do. You'll never be the same. Never again. This location is a trusty local pit stop for late night munchies or just a delicious lunch when out and about. Staff is great and friendly and I know most of them pretty well. KEEP IT UP IN N OUT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS INCREDIBLE. THE FOOD IS SUPER."}
{"text":"Let's kick back way old school - remember when you couldn't get Coors east of Colorado (yes dating myself) and my Dad would smuggle out a six pack (ON THE PLANE) and we would crack a ice cold beer in the Midwest and swear it was the greatest beer ever -- and now it is just Coors - its okay on a hot day but way way down the list of best beers.  Which begs the question, is my love for In-N-Out just a function of it's relative inaccessibility or its excellent.  Probably a bit of both - as far as the In-N-Out on the Strip (on is also relative - sort of on more precise) goes you don't just get a great burger and fries - the place comes with a show.  By show I don't mean dancing girls (although I am not ruling it out) by show I mean ever single segment of society smushed into a small restaurant - mostly drunk - all hungry - at midnight - hangry for some seared beef perfection.  So there I am - dressed business casual - with multiple shirtless dudes, bachelorettes and whole host of Vegas finest - all congregating peacefully while waiting for our number to be called and shove the Double into our face.  The five star review may not be applicable at ever hour of the day - but at midnight after entertaining clients all day - eating practically nothing - the Double at In-N-Out is one of the greatest things in creation - and you need it Animal Style because of course you do and I don't really even know what Animal Style means.  The patties are cooked perfect - cheese is melty - lettuce and tomato super fresh - bun holds up to the beef and toppings and it is just the best late night meal.  Also went Animal Style on the fries - probs not absolutely necessary but yes on the burger.  As much as I would like to see In-N-Out move east - I think my preference is to maintain the mythical status of the once a year late night calorie explosion in Vegas when I never have to consider it just another burger."}
{"text":"Being somewhat new to the area, this was my first In-N-Out experience. Upon entering, there was a long line of hungry customers. However, the line went by fast. The cashier was so upbeat and friendly. First thing she said was a cheery \"Hi how are you!\" You don't get that kind of happy customer service at other fast food places.  I had perused the \"secret\" menu before coming here, so I knew what I wanted -- cheeseburger, animal style. The cashier suggested a \"combo\" so I ordered that. It came with fries and a medium drink.  Considering that everything is cooked up fresh, the wait wasn't too long. The cheeseburger was wonderful to look at - fresh, bright and tempting. One bite and I was in heaven~  The fries on the other hand were just so-so.  For the price, quality, and service, In-N-Out surely beats other fast food joints."}
{"text":"Loved this location so much but the last three visits included a 10 minute wait in line and they still said, \"pull around and wait for the food\" - way to pull best practices from all the other shitty fast food joints.  At least the guy was honest and said he gave our food to the car ahead of us and needed to recook everything.   Advice: go to another location!!!"}
{"text":"This is an interesting little place. My friend decided to go here during my visit to the area. This was really surprising as I fancy them as a fitness and health person. it was pretty busy. I would have never imagined them going here. You order your burger and fries and wait until it is cooked. It is not sitting in a bin somewhere for an hour. I ordered the double because I thought the burgers were smaller.  The burger was really good and the fries were also fresh cut. Of course I did not finish it off as I was full after the first burger and some fries. If you are up for a fast meal with more freshness than some other joints than check it out."}
{"text":"The service was ridiculously slow it took 10 minutes to get a 3oz burger and fries. Since being cooked fresh it shouldn't be all dried out either."}
{"text":"I love in and out.  Triple Triple is such a great burger.  3 patties, 3 slices of cheese. ask for salt to put on the bland fries. get extra lemon slice to put with thier fresh lemonade. I'm getting hungry thinking about it. Guess what i'm having for dinner:)"}
{"text":"I was in the area on Sunday and was thinking about lunch. When I saw the sign, I decided that this is where I'll have lunch. After stopping off at the Karsten Golf Club,I drove to the take out window. The line was long and it was 1:00 PM. They had a guy outside taking our orders before we go to the window, before you knew it, you were paying, getting your order and driving off. I love their french fries and the hamburgers are always hot off the grill."}
{"text":"Did our Christmas Angel that day and stopped off to grab some quick food.   I like In-N-Out no matter where it's located. My only issue with this one is with the french fries. They must have been sitting in the tray waiting to be matched up with a burger order because  ours were limp.  Maybe I should order their twice cooked fries."}
{"text":"It seems every time I head west for either golf or coming back from LA, I like to stop off and grab a number 1. The burger always has fresh produce and the fries are one of the best."}
{"text":"Nobody told me about ordering \" double double animal style\" but when I caught on to what the locals were doing, I jumped right in and have not been able to do it any other way at this nifty retro keeping it simple burger house!  Nobody makes burgers look like the menu picture...EXCEPT here!  It is a point of pride!   Can we talk for a moment about the fry guy !  How strong. How swift.  How forceful the spud-splitting slices slipping salined into the vats.  Fresh cut never looked or tasted so good. How can I return to the one who has served \"over xx-trillion customers\"?  And does that vendor count the customers they have disserviced?  I wonder.  But not for long.  I have to be re-jeuvenated as I pass out from brain freeze sipping my FABULOUS malt. By the way...you can get 7 up on tap here!  YUP! This is a must make a meal whenever you meander near MESA or thereabouts!"}
{"text":"Great, fresh burgers. Ingredients are always fresh and the burger came out hot. Never had wilty toppings at an In N Out, this place is no exception. The place was busy, even for a Thursday night at closing time. Speaking of closing time, keep an eye on the hours if you are out looking for late night grub, there were numerous people that came in and were refused service as it was time to close. It seemed a bit early in my mind but not everywhere in Vegas is 24hr. If you're reading this review and have never had In N Out, check out their secret menu if you haven't heard! The grilled cheese is perfect if you don't want a gut bomb right before bed."}
{"text":"Gross we are at the drive through watching the cooking and one of the employees \"Nicole\" just sneezed big time into the food she preparing. ."}
{"text":"Ate here late Friday night and Sunday evening.   Never had a long wait, people in the drive through were cool, orders were always correct.  I'm never disappointed when I come here.  Double double animal style protein style"}
{"text":"FOOD: This place is the epitome of quality over quantity in terms of its menu. The only choices are burgers, fries, and shakes. The fries are soo good! Burgers are also amazing for a fast food chain. Shakes are mediocre and I wouldn't recommend getting them. In-N-Out's menu may look basic, but there are some hidden items on the menu. For example, get the Animal Style Fries and you can have that as a whole meal. The fries are covered in cheese, thousand island dressing, and onions. They are good but very heavy. You can get as many patties and slices of cheese as you want. Ask for a \"4 by 4\" and you will get 4 patties and 4 slices of cheese on your burger. You can even ask them to make your fries crispy if you like them that way.   PRICE: Best value in town! Burger, fries, and soft drink will cost less than $6. The low price and great food keep you coming back.   ATMOSPHERE: Typical fast food joint, nothing special. It can get quite busy in there though.   SERVICE: I think In-N-Out employees are really Carebears in human costumes. They are so polite and very helpful.   SKINNY: You don't know what you're missing! One of the best burgers I've ever had in my life, and the best deal in town for a good meal."}
{"text":"Oh Sweet Jesus I love In n Out. This is in no way located near me, but if I'm in Tempe.. I'm going to In N Out.  Shakes, delicious burgers with fresh ingredients. HOld on, I need to stop reviewing and go to the drive thru....."}
{"text":"I've had this place once in Cali, and I remember it being ALOT better! Good enough as to which is why I wanted to get it again in Vegas.  But ehh. Not sure if it was just this location."}
{"text":"What's the big deal about this place?!? The burgers taste the same like any other burger joint. The Fries are nothing special either! The food is priced well but what's all the hype about?   Am I missing something here?  This is a normal burger joint and almost everyone is saying this is the best burger ever? Really?!?  Sorry, nothing special here."}
{"text":"I gave you my hard earned cash six times in one week - all animal style double doubles.  After that I would get queasy just looking at your bright red and yellow sign.  But I'm back.  It took over a year but I'm ready to give you some more money... and I have made my peace with the fries, too."}
{"text":"In-N-Out! Nom nom nom!  I normally don't like fast food at all!  I don't even eat meat so who would have thought I could find a grilled cheese sandwich so exciting but there is something about this place...  They grill that bread perfectly and the combination with the lettuce and mushroom is just delicious.  They have great fries and this stuff isn't all greasy or hurt my stomach (like most fast food joints!) I also enjoy their milk shakes.  I have also been to one in the Bay Area and this one is way way better.    In-N-Out is our Vegas tradition and probably the cheapest meal you will get on your trip.  This may as well be a Vegas institution for me. haha."}
{"text":"Vegas Round two!!!! This time I came with my husband and his family.   After dropping off our luggage we walked approximately 1.6miles to this Location. I'd say we DEFINITELY deserved a few burgers!  As you can imagine the restaurant was packed!!! Hardly anywhere to sit! Our Food took a while because of the wait. No complaints, Everything was wonderful!  We found a shaded area on the patio, I was however HIGHLY disgusted with the number of people feeding the pigeons outside!! There's a sign \"DO NOT FEED THE BIRDS\" this stupid guy kept throwing fries!! I had to contain my anger!!! I wish management would've thrown him out!!   I ordered the double burger, While my husband had the single. The secret sauce is probably my absolute favorite! Soooo DELISH!! As for the fries.... ugh!!! Plain Jane. This was my third time visiting a IN-N-Out restaurant! I appreciate the cleanliness! Also the staff is friendly! Thank you In-N-out for another great experience."}
{"text":"This is my favourite burger place in the USA. I'm on a diet right now so I was unable to try the double double burger. So instead I just got a regular hamburger fries and a lemonade. I managed to stay within my diet and enjoy the most delicious burger I've ever had. This location, like every other one I've been to, is incredibly busy. However, because of the limited, simple menu, they are very fast and efficient. I still had to wait about 10 minutes but there was probably 30 people ahead of me. Not bad! One thing that really impressed me about this place is how hygienic everything is. The staff is always running around cleaning things and if anything hits the floor, straight to the garbage! The atmosphere reminds me of a 1950s diner. If you've never been here before, give yourself a treat and try it."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much from this chain.  I've been craving in n out for a while now and comparing this experience from my last (it was a in n out in San Fran) this spot definitely chops the last one I went to.  The staffs were super friendly, holding the doors open for when guests are walking in and throwing away customers' trash.   The food came out quick and the restaurant was poppin with people around a weekday afternoon.  Got myself 2 double doubles because I was hungry and needed to satisfy my cravings.  Definitely loved every bite"}
{"text":"Being born and raised in Vegas I grew up eating In and Out. Even when you're driving down the street you can already smell the burgers cooking and fries frying. If you're new to this chain, make sure you try the animal fries. It'll be worth the calories!  I got a to regular cheese burger with grilled onions and chopped pepers (peppers are not that spicy). This chain always toasts the bread to perfection. I took this burger home and was about a 15 minute drive and it was still hot and crunchy!   In and out is not like other fast food burger joints. The taste and recipe have always stayed consistent since I was kid. They also make the burger right when you order it, so if you're dining in, be prepared to wait.   The drive thru line is very efficient and fast.  Don't let the multiple cars fool you! There's always a staff member taking orders from you car that way it makes the lineore faster. There was probably about 8 cars in front of me and we waited about 10 min only. Super quick!  I have yet to try the hot chocolate but I heard it's delicious. YES, HOT CHOCOLATE is supposedly out of this world. BUT I have tried their bomb shakes. Warning:  If you are lactose like me, it's very milky! BUT so worth the restroom trips after. LOL"}
{"text":"if i could give them one star i would, literally worst experience of my life! got food poisoning and was throwing up for hours, don't even waste your time here. you all should be ashamed of yourselves it's embarrassing to the in n out name. HONESTLY go anywhere else, mcdonald's maybe?"}
{"text":"Great burger. Lives up to its hype with the succulent double-double cheeseburger. This was my second time at an In-N-Out and I was not disappointed. The burger is juicy, consisted, and feels of quality despite this being categorized as fast-food. One thing is I tried to like the 'animal style' fries (ordered it two times now), but it is not good and a bit overrated. The price of the animal fries are about the same as a double-double and does not satisfy me. The dressing makes it soggy and sticky and I generally prefer the regular cut fries to be able to add to my burger or add on ketchup to it. Ordering the animal fries also added an additional 12-15 minute of wait for me which was a bit annoying.   In-N-Out is great and hope it makes it out to the Midwest in the future!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best fast food burger on the face of the earth. Going to Vegas from Illinois, going to In-N-Out Burger was on my bucket list, as I've not been there in many years. Please build one in the Chicagoland!!!!"}
{"text":"This is one tasty burger. I think large menus are overrated. Places like In-N-Out that are so confident in their skill in a limited number of items intrigue me more. The burgers are very tasty and I love the crispy fries. It's awesome that they also have the \"secret\" menu which is really just great customer service. Animal style is a might tasty option. This location is continuously busy, but the employees are always friendly and working hard to get everyone through as quickly as possible."}
{"text":"Never was a In N Out fan but my husband likes it and I went here to get him a double double w/cheese protein style and myself a single w/cheese WELL DONE.  They obviously don't know what well done means as it was pink inside and I threw it away"}
{"text":"Everything here tastes great & the staff is very friendly & professional.  Everything from their protein burger to animal style fries & shakes tastes phenomenal.  Only downside to this place is sometimes it gets really crowded."}
{"text":"Just eat there. Its amazing. Oh and order from the \"secret menu\" you can get a mix of flavors for your shake. I personally LOVE LOVE  LOVE the shakes I think they are amazing! Along with the burgers and the fresh cut fries!! MMMMM"}
{"text":"Literally almost died walking here from the strip (but it was totally worth it). My boyfriend claimed it was \"right down the street\" but really I would suggest getting an uber because it's a trek and the intersections you have to cross are kinda dangerous.  Anyway, we came around noon and it was heaving. Like line out the door. But they run the place supper efficiently so orders are coming out super quick. My burger was hot and super fresh and everything in n out claims to be. Ended up getting back on line for another lol. Enough said!!! P.S. I like how they have fresh lemons at the drink station."}
{"text":"It's a good burger and milkshake-great for the price.  I am not a big fan of their fries, but I know a lot of people who are.  The hidden menu is fun to try out as well!  This place is always busy, but they have a good staff that speeds up the line quickly."}
{"text":"I'm a So Cal native and boy did I miss In and Out when I lived in Colorado. Now that I live in Vegas I didn't think there was any out here. I am absolutely thrilled to have one after all!!  Tonights visit was like a little bit of home :)  Drive thru line went very quickly, order taker friendly and repeated our order several times. I ordered the double double ketchup mustard only, and boyfriend got the double double animal style without lettuce. French fries were hot and crisp.   Food was perfect, good presentation but the only thing negative was we were not offered any ketchup nor was any placed in the box never the less they get a full 5 stars from me!!"}
{"text":"Being from the Midwest, I only hear stories about In-N-Out.  Until my visit to this location, I had never tried In-N-Out, and to be honest, I was a little underwhelmed.  I'm not very adventurous so I got a Double-Double Zed.  No veggies.  No sauce.  Just meat and cheese on a bun.  The bun was nice.  Burger decent.  Good, but I've had better.  My biggest issue was the fries.  I struggled for a while to come up with a description on why I didn't like the fries.  They were crispy and salty, but something didn't taste right.  Then I figured it out, they were dry inside.  Good fries are warm and pillow-y inside and crispy and salty on the outside.  The easiest way to achieve this is to double fry them.  First on a lower temp, then second time on a high temp to crisp them up.  Many other places achieve this by par cooking and then freezing the fries so they only need to be cooked once more on site.  In-N-Out prides themselves on using fresh ingredients, so they aren't doing this.  The problem is, they were probably only cooked once, and probably overcooked as well.  That's why the fries weren't any good.  I tried to eat them with ketchup, but it didn't help.  I threw away most of my portion of fries.  I don't know if this is the norm at all In-N-Outs or if this was an aberration at this site on this day, but I don't know if I'd recommend In-N-Out.  Guess it's just a West Coast thing."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great friendly service, good food, good value. I just wish it was bigger. There's nowhere to sit when it's busy, and they need to work on wiping off the tables in the dining area more often."}
{"text":"This was my very first time at in-n-out burger, since they are not in the chicagoland area.  It is a new addition to the LinQ promenade.   We stopped for lunch, because only 1 out of 6 of us had ever been there.   There is so much hype about it.  It is a buger place.  A fast-food burger place.   Honestly, it was a good burger, but nothing to write home about.   I'd go back if I wanted a burger and was in the area, but if I never went back, that wouldn't phase me either."}
{"text":"Everything was good here and the staff was super efficient.  Pretty much th most you can ask of a burger joint."}
{"text":"Consistently good quality food. I can feed 6 people for under $35. However, teens manning the registers can create hiccups when they are socially awkward.  So, no four stars here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome...having never had it before, my buddy recommended it highly for lunch one day and we walked over from Excalibur (10-15 minute walk) to experience it.  Fantastic and we even went again the next day for lunch.  Double Double with fries both times, enjoyed it both times, there is a good reason the line was almost out the door both trips.    Love it and look forward to going to another one sometime soon!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on our way home after a day of traveling and we received the wonderful customer service from Katie. In a day and age of poor customer service, it was refreshing to experience what customer service should always be, polite, professional and courteous! We will return to this location!"}
{"text":"Got into Vegas late Saturday night, picked up my rental car and the first stop was to In-N-Out.  I've been once before and I wanted to make sure and try it again.  The wait wasn't as bad as I thought it would be at midnight.  Decided to park and order takeout from the counter.  Ordered a Double-Double animal style, animal style fries well done, and a Neapolitan shake.  It took about 10 minutes for the order to be filled so it's not necessarily fast food.  Took the order with me and went to my hotel to check in so I didn't get to dig into everything for another half hour.  The burger was very good.  Tasty and juicy, a decent size offering and very affordable.  The fries were another story.  I wanted to try them well done and by the time I got to them they were ROCK HARD.  Now I'm not sure if this was because I waited a half hour to dig into them or they are normally this way when you order them well done.  Even ordering them animal style did not soften them up.  I wasn't impressed with the fries the first time I went to In-N-Out so I guess my opinion has gotten worse.  The shake was good, nothing to go WOW about.  Overall I enjoyed In-N-Out.  The burger was very good.  Way better then McD's, BK or Wendys.  I say it's on par with 5 Guys which also makes a decent burger but whose fries are WAY better."}
{"text":"Can't beat In-N-Out hamburgers.  This location is usually very busy after 4pm.  Try grilled onions for better taste"}
{"text":"Decent burger for the price. Fresh, tasty and hot.....but the fries? Nah man, you can do WAY better than that! Cut them a little thicker, don't fry them so long, and keep em' from being dry. I have had burgers from every fast food there is just about. From a $ standpoint, this is the best value. However, I can get a way better burger by paying a couple bucks more elsewhere.. I cannot really complain about this place but as far as best burger? Nah....not even close."}
{"text":"I do not understand the appeal of In-N-Out.  I've tried it several times, and each time I'm thinking 'Ok, this is just an average burger with below average fries'.  The prices are good and service is quick and friendly, but the burgers are thin and done too much for my liking, and the fries are not seasoned well and tasteless unless you drown them in sauce.  I much prefer 5-Guys or Shake Shack (don't worry West Coasters - Shake Shack announced today that they are expanding to the West Coast).  I won't be visiting here again."}
{"text":"How do you not love this place. Everything is fresh, place is always clean and the service is on point.  Interesting though... I never see the same employee twice at any of their stores. Not that I go that often, but I've never seen the same one there.  That aside... they lost a star because my protein style double double was a little messier than I expected and I mad the mistake of ordering it to go in the car. Ugh... it was a drippy mess.  I like that they are obviously christian and put their little sayings on the inside of the cup bottoms etc... as long as they don't try to baptize people at the sofa machine I think it's cool. They believe in God and are proud to share it.  Other than that... food is always hot and delicious so I will be back."}
{"text":"More hype than anything, bland flavorless food here, slow production, not worth it.  The fries were like wet cardboard, burgers had no flavor at all.  Numerous lazy flies drifted around the dinning area,  pretty messy overall, not much effort had been given to cleaning this place.    not worth it."}
{"text":"The east-coast colleague of mine was dying to have some In-N-Out burgers so we decided to get some.  This location is right next to UNLV so it's packed with students and everyone else being enticed by the signature waft from the single-mile radius.  Got the double double animal style and everyone was more than satisfied."}
{"text":"I have heard so much about this place. It was packed but the service was fast. We scrambled and got seats when people got up. My food was pretty good I wouldn't rant and rave though. It was just ok I'm full and happy now I can sleep lol"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is the closest in n out to home, there's been times when I'd rather deal with the traffic and parking to go to the one at the Linq. I normally let it go when they forget the onions I want on my burger (which has happened a few times at this location) but this time it was with the onions and I asked for the meat well done and the way the meat was cooked was wrong and I know because it wasn't specified on the receipt. Finally the part that killed the meal was finding a hair stuck to my fries.."}
{"text":"Been to this location 3x, every order is has been wrong and fries are always soggy and gross. Take the extra 5min and go back to the Tropicana location."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm not a fan of fast food. But, I will always be a fan of In-N-Out. I love trying different things off of their secret menu! But, I'm definitely a sucker for animal style burgers and fries. I tend to always get my burger as protein style. Also, I have to have a vanilla shake every time I come to In-N-Out. Coming from a state without In-N-Out, this place is a definite treat!"}
{"text":"I'm usually a huge fan of In-N-Out, but today must've been just an off day for this restaurant. I had a double-double animal protein burger, animal style fries, and regular fries. Everything just seemed like tons and tons of salt was poured on it. It was way too salty. Next time, I will definitely ask for no salt on the fries. I recommend you do the same or ask for reduced salt."}
{"text":"Staff is allways great. Burgers are ok they used to be better. Great simple concept. Value is fare."}
{"text":"This place is solid.  The burgers and fries taste fresh and I never feel gross after eating it unlike BK and Wendys (not that I don't love them too unfortunately).    It's simple and has its own language.  If you haven't tried it yet, ask for the burger or fries (or both) animal style.  Great shakes!"}
{"text":"1st to Review? @IN_N_OUT_Burger! Located near Sunset station & Galleria Mall this place is hopping!  15 cars in the drive-thru @ 2 pm. BUT anyone who's eaten at In & Out KNOWS -It's always worth the wait.  One of these days I'm gonna order a 10x10 and see how long it takes to finish it!  Today however I went for the Double-Double Extra Pickles & Onion with sauce. My Usual!  Fantastic down to the last crumb of bun!  I hear there are now 7 locations throughout the valley-we could do with 10 more or the nice catering truck they have at In-N-Out!"}
{"text":"Remember, this location is for tourists only. Expect to wait at least 30 mins. Cuz every person from the Midwest to the Eastern seaboard is here for their once in a lifetime In N Out Burger experience."}
{"text":"this has got to be the best location the burgers are the best  the people that work there are good at what they do i would recommend it to eveyone"}
{"text":"This is the busiest place you have ever been to. BUT the FASTEST service you've ever seen!  According to Local News Sources this location serves 6-8000 hamburgers a day!!  Almost every visitor to Las Vegas must have this location on their \"to do list\"-I do see lots of tourists taking pictures and raving about it as they sit and devour their burgers.  Being a local I eat @IN_N_OUT_Burger pretty regularly so I like to change it up and do something different every now and again.  I ordered a 4x4 w/pickles & onion ONLY plus a regular with everything. 2 orders of fries.  Only the 4x4 was mine but it was a real challenge to eat it all-BUT  I was determined not to wuss out in front of my son.  It's only $1 to add an extra patty w/cheese so dare to be different and next time go crazy and try a 10x10 !!    ps. The COOLEST thing about this location is the GIFT SHOP outback. You can get all those cool In-N-Out souvenirs you've been checking out in the brochures."}
{"text":"I love this location. Its the standard issue but they are FULLY staffed and its so close to the STRIP you see lots of hot babes frequent the joint. This location typically has several differnet car clubs and motorcycle groups that meet to show off their wheels. And of course the food is typical IN & OUT and they love to se the special orders like the 10x10(10 beef pattys,10 cheese slice on a bun) They see lots of Competitive Eaters here. As afar as burgers go this place is ACES!"}
{"text":"I am 36 years old. And today, I only just popped my In-N-Out cherry...and it was everything I thought it could be.  There are many burgers out there...different buns, a shit ton of condiments and toppings...with out without cheese, and the list goes on to infinity. However, while you can get delicious burgers everywhere, it is the \"homestyle\" burger experience I've always craved and had a special place in my heart for...and that's what In-N-Out is, a home burger.  To start the fries are fresh cut and fried, and they're generous with them...nice and potato-ey, all you need is a thimble of ketchup and you're golden.  The burger itself is really good...satisfying, tasty in all the right amounts - from the soft and pillowy yet grease grilled bun, to the perfectly melted cheese, grilled onions diced, the animal sauce, chilled tomato and crisp lettuce, to the juicy and all so savory burger patties...the flavor is balanced. I had a Double Double Animal Style for my first, and I wasn't dissapointed.  The most pleasing thing about my experience eating here was the staff...the kitchen is visible and small and I count 14 eager, articulate, and super friendly workers...I must say, they run a well oiled machine; all were busy and they were coordinated as a team. The cashiers were quick, friendly, and efficient...someone walked up to the side of the counter off to the side pf the line and they were on it yelling to the interior, \"counter service!\" Then a friendly worker was there to help with the packet of ketchup or napkins or whatever...  I'll be back...for a Triple Triple Animal Style. :)"}
{"text":"So happy AZ has an in n out.    I always order double double protein style, mustard fried, peppers, grilled onions, no sauce (sauce is better but a lot of calories) this option is keto friendly if you're into that"}
{"text":"This was my first time at the restaurant. It was super busy. However, the wait wasn't that long at all even considering this was EDC weekend and it seemed like everyone wanted to eat at in and out burger. The food was fine but nothing special."}
{"text":"Best burger ever you must order a double double with grilled onions light lettuce light tomato extra sauce extra toasted bun strawberry and vanilla milkshake"}
{"text":"*****FIVE STARS***** the best of the best, the crowd was big but got fast service too. the manager Yael supervises a team of over 50 youthful energetic employees and that in of its self is a strong indication of what this young women can do. she could coach a team and take them to the world series. the large food order for the 8 of us was all correct and hot when served.thank you in n out & Yael."}
{"text":"My first time at an In-n-Out burger!! Being an east coast guy, and NY in specific, i never saw any in-n-out, steak-n-shake, or any of those type of places. I was in Vegas for a few days and had FatBurger several times. Then, while driving around killing time, i see In-n-Out. The tales of this place are legendary (up there with White Castle), so it was a must that i stop by. The first thing i noticed was the insane line. I was determined to wait though, and shockingly it dissipated in about 3 minutes. Next thing i see is the most basic menu i had ever seen: Burgers /Hot Dogs/ Fries.. is that it? I ordered a couple double cheeseburgers and fries, then jealously saw some people getting fries with sauces and cheese. That wasn't on the menu but i guess if you go there frequently, you know."}
{"text":"Best burger ever. Love their fresh cut fries. Always crowded as usual but the wait is worth it. We always get the classic cheeseburger with grilled onions and extra pickles."}
{"text":"I have heard about this place for years and have never lived near one so I have never tried it. We went out of our way to eat at this in and out burger. I was very disappointed. The burger stuck to the roof of my mouth. I'm also not a fan of processed American cheese...yuck. The fries were crisp but not hot. I m glad I checked this place off my list. Probably never again. Steak and Shake is better although they use American cheese on their burgers also .  On the level of Mcdonalds  on a good day."}
{"text":"Awesome, Awesome,Awesome food when you wake up from a long Vegas Party Night! Reasonable prices and simple fresh food here. Burgers,  Fries and Shakes is all they sell here at In & Out and they do a great job at it.   We arrive at 11:15 am and this place was already getting packed and they open at 10:30 am,  but they keep the line moving and get the orders out to you pretty fast.  I'm a fan"}
{"text":"This is a great, simple, back to basics burger place. Everything is delicious and you'll definitely need to check out the secret menu before heading in. The fries are kind of boring if you just get them plain, but the animal fries are to die for! My only recommendation is if you order food through the drive through, definitely check it before you leave. I always get no onion on my animal fries, and every couple of times they put them on there and they're a hassle to pick off. The facility is always clean and the staff is very very friendly!"}
{"text":"Consistency and simplicity are key to a thriving burger joint. Doesn't matter where on the West Coast you go... you can be guaranteed fresh patties no more than from 500 miles away, cheap menu, a secret menu that stays the same, and efficient, college aged customer service.. along with the wait of made to order. Also, you can pretty much count on all of the seating being the exact same. I'm glad they started taking card all those years ago.  Thank you for finally opening the only fast food burger worthy of Summerlin palates. We don't have to drive down to Tropicana for our fix.  In and out has always been a treat for me. It's not the burger I can eat weekly but I do have my cravings and need my quarterly fix.   I think the drive through is a little faster than inside but expect, as everywhere, for your wait to be at least 5 minutes.  Rookie tip- ask for extra spread. You can never douse your fries in too much thousand island-esque goodness.  P.S. I hear they pay well and have pretty good benefits!  That's what a hamburgers all about!"}
{"text":"Consistently great. Long line moves fairly quickly. Double-Double Animal Style is my go-to."}
{"text":"It's In-N-Out. Always good, inexpensive, and drive-through line moves steadily. Double-double animal style is my go-to."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty and great service. A line at 3pm on a Monday tells you something. We liked the double double animal style, which means pickles, a thousand island type spread and grilled onions (plus mustard on the patties pre-grilling). Preferred the fries plain and NOT animal style, which means the spread, grilled onions and cheez whiz. Yum"}
{"text":"Diese Kette ist seit 20 Jahren mein absoluter Favorit in Sachen Fast Food. Früher müsste man noch suchen oder auch weit fahren, um zu einer Filiale zu gelangen, mittlerweile werden es aber immer mehr.  Leckere Burger und Pommes, Getränke unendlich, nettes Personal und es geht immer superschnell. Zudem schöne Logo T-Shirts (super Qualität). Der Preis fürs Essen ist kaum zu schlagen. Für mich die beste Option für den Lunch."}
{"text":"They amaze me! They get those orders right even when they are crazy busy.  Reasonable prices, but very limited seating. Had to wait for spot.  I noticed there were employees refilling ice wiping down counters and keeping things clean considering how busy they were.   Great food!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a protein style hamburger in the drive-thru. I got home and started eating my burger and fries. The patty is still pink. Not a brown pink, a bright pink. So gross! It's a thin patty so it shouldn't be that difficult to cook it all the way through. I immediately lost my appetite."}
{"text":"Now, if you look at my past reviews, you will know that I usually give this place 5 stars... no matter where, no matter when. This time, it was just not so much for me. The store was clean, the ingredients were fresh....I got my animal style burger.....but something seems off....I'm wondering if corporate came down on adding less salt? The flavor profile just seemed off. And to be fair, i ate there 4 times in 4 days!! LOL!"}
{"text":"Hmmm, I'm having a hard time rating In-N-Out.  One one hand, their burgers are so much better than almost any burger out there, fast food or otherwise, and therefore should be a 5 star....but if I compare it to Fatburger, I'd say its only a 4 star...  Ah, heck with it, 5 star it is.  My only complaint about In-N-Out is the fries.  I don't know why I don't like them, I think that they're too fresh, as they taste too much like a raw potato to me.  Freeze them first or something!  The burgers themselves are just as good as Fatburger's, and are just plain amazing.  I typically go with Animal Style, but even the normal is great.  In-N-Out is one of the few things I really miss about Vegas.  Too bad they're not a franchise, I'd love for one to open up in the Dallas area."}
{"text":"My friends and I had to run across a highway to get here... and it was worth it!!  Never heard about it since I live in the East coast.  They should bring it over to Boston.  I'm sick of McDonalds and Burger King.  For $2.99, you get a gigantic burger.  Every bite was amazing.  It has more flavor than other fast food burgers.  The mystery pink sauce fits perfectly with the cheese and the onions.  Their motto is \"Quality you can taste\"... and yes it's a quality burger.  The weak point of this chain is their fries.  With an improvement on their fries, they will get the 5 stars.  Whenever In-N-Out decides to move to the East Coast, I might have to abandon my no fast food diet."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly and fast. Everyone we go, order is correct and food never disappoints."}
{"text":"Love this place, moves you through quickly, food is always great, no complaints at all! Cost is great...food is always yummy!! We have this like 2 times a month!"}
{"text":"We were on our way to Grand Canyon and planned to make a stop here! It's a must!  I finally tried the double-double animal style burger and fries \"animal style\" as well. It was so good. Of course, I had to ask my husband to help finish the food.  Animal style burger means more lettuce, tomato and pickles. Fries comes with fried onion, cheese and mayo. You can see my picture! We ordered one regular burger, regular fries, one double-double animal style burger and animal style fries.  Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The service is always impeccable here; everyone is smiling, working hard, and polite. The place is always clean and people are always checking to clean tables, sweep, and empty the trash.  The food is delicious. I am absolutely in love with their sauce. I just loce that the fries are fresh and they taste so good! The shakes are awesome too."}
{"text":"Animal style ftw!"}
{"text":"Best damn burger I've ever had in my whole entire life! On the east coast we can only hope to have In-N-Out Burger. They were very busy because being on vacay no one pays attention to the time, and of course it was lunchtime, but turn around was very quick. Cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"my standard order - hamburger, animal style, mustard instead of spread, toast - fries, xxwell. they get it right every time. food is above average and service is well above average."}
{"text":"The food tastes great. The only problem is the wait. It doesn't matter if you walk in or go through the drive-thru, there's always a wait."}
{"text":"Typical chain. Service was quick, food was cheap and the quality of food was great. This restaurant meets the standard"}
{"text":"For my first In-n-out experience, it was pretty good! The place was packed, the wait was total time about 30 minutes. But my God what a delicious burger.  Our group had two different orders, mine came out swimmingly, the other not so much. Their burger was cold and tasted questionable.  The other reason there's a star knocked off is the chaos of the place, there's no real guidance for where to wait to get your order. Some people form lines, others gather around the soda fountains, others find a seat and then can't hear their name being called. Some consistency would do wonders."}
{"text":"I waited for years for \"In-N-Out Burger\" to open a store in my neighborhood and they \"Did\"  I stop by every time I have a craving for them. The Store is Top Notch and right down the Street what else could a Man ask for. Life should be this Simple!!!!   Thank You,  \"In-N-Out Burger\"   Jerry"}
{"text":"A must anytime in Vegas always hot and fresh, double double combo with pink lemonade, don't think to hard on this one."}
{"text":"Ate here with family while walking The Strip. Fast service, and a very tasty burger. Tasted like a better quality Big Mac. Will definitely eat here again when I'm in the area. Wish they had an In and Out in Florida. Oh well. Hopefully later down the line"}
{"text":"We ate here on our last visit to Las Vegas. This was our first time eating here. This location was slammed, of course. I will admit not a good location to eat at if you have never eaten at an In-N-Out. We now know how and what to order especially since the first time was not that great. The burgers are super thin so make sure you order a larger portion. I HIGHLY recommend the Animal. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I didn't mean to do it. I created a monster. The Buddha asks for In n Out at least once a week now. Animal fries, shakes, the whole shebang! It's cool though. We don't eat fast food too often and I love it almost as much as he does. Plus this is kind of our drive in movie staple. We always order the same thing and we always get way too full. The service here is touch and go at best. Everyone is friendly enough the majority of the time...    Aside from the service, I can't differentiate much on this location from others. They are all relatively the same. Pretty consistent on preparation and store design.   Yum. I want animal fries now."}
{"text":"Personally I do not understand why the lines are so long. The food is good but would not be my favorite. The kids like it but I feel a bit over priced. Many people think it's the best burger joint. For me it's ok."}
{"text":"I have to be honest, I don't really eat here. However I eat at a restaurant in the same strip mall and I could never get into their driveway because the drive-through line for in and out burger is always so long. And the outside attendant doesn't care if you have to wait for her to take orders instead of being polite and managing the line properly."}
{"text":"I was hopeful that ordering the fries \"well done\" would remedy the stale taste I find their fries to have....it did not.  They still almost tasted fake.  The double double burger was as good as a fast food burger gets.  The line at this location was 10 cars deep on a Saturday night, taking around 30 minutes from pull up to leaving with food."}
{"text":"I rarely review fast food chains, but this placed certainly earned it. I went through the drive through to place a large order for a group. The person taking the order did so with ease. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time. The order was also accurate. In-N-Out certainly has a reputation for their great service so this likely does not surprise most. They made my life easier. No one like placing large orders for a group. It is a no win situation.  As always the burgers were very good. The only issue is still that their fries are just not that great. It is still worth it, but great fries would make them unstoppable."}
{"text":"Are you from the east coast? If you are you HAVE to come here. Best shakes yummy fries and awesome burgers. There's also a secret menu... but I only know some of the menu items. -animal fries -well done fries -grilled cheese Inside the restraint is clean and a little bit noisy but you can here the people next to you. The service is also really friendly."}
{"text":"I love this location...... the customer service is always awesome.... tonight there was two people at the drive thru.... window 1 & 2...... Alex was the first cashier. His customer service was so awesome... he was very patient and kept a smile on his face.... the second cashier asked if we needed any condiments and she was very polite. No matter how long the lines are here.... I come back always because the customer service is always great. Growing up in California I was raised off these burgers and it's great to see that they provide the same service in Las Vegas as they do in California...... Always consistent/ always keeping our young kids employed #1 burger spot always...."}
{"text":"Always go to this location every time I come to visit Las Vegas. Friendly and upbeat staff. Food is still the same which is awesome consistency. Other than that, very clean and convenient for UNLV students as well since it's right next to greenspun hall."}
{"text":"Favorite in n out in town. Caitlin was very nice. Thanks everyone for the great service"}
{"text":"Honestly what is not to love about In-N-Out Burger? They have tasty, well prepped burgers and french fries. Service is 99.9% of the time great - most likely because this burger chain actually pays their employees decent wages and from what I have heard from friends who have worked there - the chain actually does have a good rapport with their employees.  Any In-N-Out I have been to is squeaky clean and employees are consistently cleaning the tables and floors - not just this specific one. At this one in particular I have noticed the drive-thru can start to get a little out of hand, but usually they will send out an extra person to start taking orders.  Why I love In-N-Out over most burger chains - their burgers have a crispness to them, the lettuce is not soggy, the tomatoes are fresh, you can get your onions grilled. The french fries are cut fresh (you can see them doing it). The shakes are very good.   The menu is simple. Yet... we all know of the \"secrets\" behind what you can order at In-N-Out. I applaud them for not layering bacon and BBQ sauce and all kinds of other crap onto their burgers like so many other chains do.   In-N-Out knows what they're doing and I appreciate that.  PS - This was the very first In-N-Out to open in Las Vegas and it was a ridiculous madhouse when it opened."}
{"text":"I'm not sure there's much I can say that hasn't already said about Inn n Out in general or this Inn n Out in particular.  Overall Inn n Out never disappoints. The burgers are delicious, fresh and the cheese always perfectly melted. The lettuce has a crunch and the tomatoes aren't mealy. Things you would think would be expected of most places that serve burgers, but often these goals aren't met - except for Inn n Out. Quality burgers. All the time.  Overall I'm a fan of the Double Double with grilled onions. And their chocolate shakes. Damn good.  This Inn n Out has a small parking lot and it is slightly awkward to get into if you are heading North on Maryland Parkway. However, these all issues are trumped by great customer service and even better food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The burgers have a cleaner flavor than the normal fast food places, but still nothing special, and smaller in size. The fries are some of the worst in the business in my opinion, they are very bland, not much crispness. They are extremely efficient in the ordering process. Just another average place overall."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious at In N Out, but the Arby's next door keeps getting my business because there is not 15 cars in the drive thru."}
{"text":"I don't get it. The food just isn't good. Nostalgia isn't enough for me to warrant repeated visits to this restaurant.  I will say that the kids working the counter are generally pretty nice. The shakes aren't bad either."}
{"text":"Won't be coming here again! As much as I love In-N-Out and as much as I come to this location... horrible service. Ordered a double double with animal fries. A family of 4 ordered after me and ordered the same thing but hey got their food first. People that were coming in after me we're getting their food before me and I don't understand why. I'm pretty sure out ordered were all similar seeing as how all we can order are burgers and fries. When I asked why my order was taking so long, they said they were waiting on my fries. So I guess my fries were special since I ordered before a bunch of people but they got their burgers and fries first. Sorry Henderson In-N-Out but I'll go further rather than go to you again..."}
{"text":"The burgers here are soooo good. And it's always busy here... Which is always a good sign. Love your food keep up the quality and great customer service!"}
{"text":"Best fast food joint ever. Double Double with grilled onions and chopped chili's is a MUST! Especially with a side of animal style fries & a shake. They have options for everyone!! So definitely check it out- especially if you don't have it where you're from."}
{"text":"Adapted from an earlier review of this place:  I teetered between giving this place 3 or 4 stars.  I like that they have a very limited menu. You have 4 options: burger, fries, soda and/or shakes. That limited menu allows for food to be made fresh and people too be served quickly.  I guess that is why they named the place in and out burger.    You can tell they are using quality meat, and not filler meats like other places.  You also can tell that they use fresh produce.  It was cool watching the guy peel potatoes for their fries.  I have to admit one thing though, the burger is too small for my liking. I ordered the 2 meat, 2 cheese burger, a.k.a. the double-double, and actually had room for another burger.  Fries are average. You will not see this restaurant's fries in your grocery freezer like some other places has it for themselves!  Shakes are decent but small as well.   Finally got around to trying the lemonade, and nothing special about it.  Two things make this a 4 star experience for me.  This first thing is them starting, to my knowledge, the secret menu!  I like ordering things animal style and doing the different variations that comes about from the secret menu.  Try eating a 4X4 burger...I enjoyed that all by itself!  The second thing is there is not an In-N-Out Burger franchise anywhere in Louisiana nor Houston.  Rarity gets them that extra star over a normal fast food chain."}

Outside them asking you if you want onions on your burger, grilled or non grilled, there aren't too many surprises with this place.  I did not try the lemonade to see if it was special.    3.5 star experience rounded to 4 stars."}

{"text":"I'm not sure I could ever bring myself to give In-N-Out less then 5 stars. The Service is always so good. The menu is great. The secret menu is better. The fries are fresh and more delicious then every other chain. Period."}
{"text":"In N Out definitely lived up to their name today. We decided today was the day to try the newest location in Surprise. After seeing the drive thru lane 20 cars deep we hesitated, but decided to go through with it after we saw three smiling employees outside not only directing traffic, but taking orders. I decided on a double double with everything, fries and a drink. My son loves the fries so I got him extra. Not only did the employee at the window give the kids some hats and stickers, they were all so friendly, fast and so organized. The parking lot was clean and tons of parking  to accommodate a lot of people. We were in and out of that 20 car deep line in 8 minutes. No other fast food restaurant around can come close. We will definitely be back time and time again."}
{"text":"Coming from a Cali girl born and raised my entire life I never thought the In N Out's here could compare, but I love this location! No after how long the line it goes so quickly. The service is impeccable and everyone is always smiling. Kindness goes so far with me! You never know who needs that smile, and can turn an entire day around for someone. The burgers are always amazing and never judge when we ask for 6 hats and stickers when there's only us adults in the car lol. Thanks for making great tasting food and helping show this town what great customer service is! Best Burgers around hands down!"}
{"text":"Fresh everytime! You want frills check the secret menu."}
{"text":"Ugh.  Being from the north east! I had Never had an In&Out.  I kept hearing from people that when you go to Vegas you have to have their burger so I figured I'm in the area, I've got a car let me try it.  The long line at almost noon on a Wednesday was a good sign but that was the only one. I ordered a basic number two- single cheeseburger with fries and drink.  The fries were nasty. I don't care if they hand cut them, I don't care if they're properly seasoned. I do care that they tasted like freeze dried potato sticks. I did not eat them.  And now the burger. I wanted to love this, I really did. I've never heard a bad thing said about in and out burger. So I'll be the one to say. Where's the beef?  Bun,  lettuce? tomato and sauce for your fresh crisp and good. But there was almost no beef !"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of In-N-Out Burger - food is always great.  I rolled through the drive thru ordered the double double with grilled onions.  Always a good choice - BUT somehow I ended up with a plain cheese and tomato single burger, imagine my disappointment    I Had already driven away so I that's how the story ends.   LOL.  note to self and the drive thru folks check the order."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to an In-N-Out Burger. I really liked the Double-Double burger. The sauce is really good. I found the menu almost too simple, but I was happy with the prices. The staff was kind and my food was somewhat prompt. The facility was disgusting, though. The floors had trash and dirt and black shoe prints all over the store. The drink area was sticky and wet.   On a positive note, I did get to see one of the first UFC female fighters having a burger there after her fight. She was not in good condition, but she seemed happy to be feasting on an In-N-Out burger."}
{"text":"Best burger in the country! We come to the west coast just to eat here. Excellent! Get a four by four or double double animal style. So good!"}
{"text":"THIS IS THE WORST IN AND OUT EVER BEEN TOO. Horrible service, the cashier couldn't speak English; \"jhoanna\" i confused her on my order so I told her to cancel and start over, and some how she still messed it up...?  When I told the guy at the front he said he'd have to charge me for her mess up...? It's not my fault she don't speak English and couldn't get the correct order...  Order: protein style burger and extra fries, a cheese burger no onion, and animal style fry....   I got protein style noooo fry, and a cheeseburger with animal style burger WITH onion and fries with NO animal style on it..."}
{"text":"This place is really good. The line goes rather quickly and they got my order right. I almost got attacked by a bird here so watch out!!!"}
{"text":"The opposite of the Jerry Seinfeld line, \"I am not an animal!\". Well, Yelp, I am an animal. A carnivore to be exact.   Living in Illinois, I had never tried In and Out Burger. I've only heard things. I passed this place up the first time I was in Vegas, but not this time.  Getting there walking isn't bad, but if you're trying to get back to New York New York where our party was, it is a hassle. The sidewalk does not loop around, but oh well. Plus I think we cut through (illegally) a parking garage. There will old slot machines every where. I think it was good that we weren't being followed. If someone saw us run down a rock hill and hope myriad fences, they would have thought we robbed a place.  Speaking of robbed, you are a victim if you have NOT tried this place. Protein style: no bun, two patties, tomato and onion. It's amazing how grilled euphoria patties can garner such a reaction out of my simpleton self.   In and Out. You rock!"}
{"text":"Good burger. Ok fries. Reminds me of steak n shake. I ate it, but don't think I understand what the hype is really about... Maybe it's just because I'm not a burger person... I dunno."}
{"text":"Be prepared for a long wait on a Saturday afternoon! The burgers are well seasoned and the milkshakes are delicious. It's more of a \"have to have it\" when you come to Vegas kind of thing. The cost is comparable to any fast-food burger joint but the quality is a step up to your regular burger joint."}
{"text":"Delicious food as always, especially great late at night. Exceptionally great service this time, very polite and fast."}
{"text":"You will never go wrong with ino from their customer service to their bomb a** burgers this place is everything. I am forever a loyal customer, I am not sure what they put in their burgers but it always leaves me wanting more."}
{"text":"Not only is the burger good, but the service was great too!  The restaurant was very clean and everyone working there was so pleasant and happy to be there!  We stopped in after hearing all the hype over the years about this burger chain... just had to try it for ourselves and we most definitely weren't disappointed!  Their burgers are really good, especially if you simply get the Double Double the way it comes!  The animal style fries were outstanding!  They also have some hot peppers in the lobby, for those of us who enjoys some extra heat!  Prices are very fair (cheap!) too!!!  What's not to love?!?!?"}
{"text":"Quite literally as good as it gets! In N Out of course is an all-time classic, but I had to reiterate it and share it on here for potential East coasters or West coasters who aren't in the game and trying out their amazing burgers. It's such an American staple and I LOVE this location by my house. They have the most friendly staff! One thing I would point out would be being more on top of the cleanliness and wiping down tables and sweeping floors, but It is understandable as they are constantly serving a large amount of customers day in and day out. In N Out is so simple, and such a classic. Nothing short of incredible, and the quality is always amazing!"}
{"text":"Good place to eat at! As we all know all In-N-Out burgers taste the same. What you are reading this for is to see about the customer service & other things. The customer service is good nothing to be mad at. This service is fast, which all In-N-Out should be since the menu is limited.   However, the parking lot to this In-N-Out is terrible. I blame it on the popular restaurant Juan flaming fajita next door. The lines can get really long as well if you are going through the drive thru.    All in all great place to eat at. You won't be disappointed eating at this In-N-Out."}
{"text":"As is typical with every In N Out burger there is always a line here!!! Their burgers are good but I think there are even better burgers out there. Coming from the east coast it feels like a special treat through. I prefer mine protein style which means wrapped in lettuce. Not too shabby :)"}
{"text":"Took field trip from the convention I was attending and cabbed it to In - n - Out. Worth the trip and my co-worker turned me on to the secret menu. So good. So worth the ride. Try the mustard grilled for your patties. Animal style? Yup, love it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love in and out. Great french fries!!! They always give me plenty of water. Try protein style for people on Paleo Diet."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype, but it's not bad.   I got the double double with peppers, and it was okay-to-good, but I still felt that gross fast food feeling afterward. I guess I was expecting it to be super fresh? I went on a Friday night, and the place was so full that we shared a table with some other people which wasn't a big deal. The service was great, and one of the staff even offered to bring our food over to our table. The fries tasted okay.   If I had to pick between In-N-Out and Whataburger, I would pick Whataburger any day, but maybe that's the Texan in me coming out."}
{"text":"This is the best burger place ever, we love it.  These guys cater for food allergies and everything!!  The food is simple but awesome thins plus is so 5 out of 5"}
{"text":"What can I say? It's In-N-Out. Burgers are terrific. Service is great. And this particular store is not that crowded like the other In-N-Outs in Sin City."}
{"text":"What can I say?  For the money, this the best and freshest burger around. Don't really like their fries too much, although I appreciate the fact that they are fresh cut. Maybe they need to use another brand of oil and improve their deep frying technique?"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had. From the crispness of the bun, to the crunchiness of the lettuce, and the savory flavor of the patty, nothing else compares. Try \"animal style\" if you feel like living on the edge :) In-N-Out is doing something right, the drive through is ALWAYS packed. Doesn't matter what time it is. Luckily they have someone taking orders in the drive thru line which makes the process so much faster."}
{"text":"Being from southern CA, I know my In N out. This location has consistently disappointing fries. They are either over cooked or hard as rocks!  If you want the best fries, go to the Peoria location!!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest: I'm not much of a fast food person. Therefore, I have no real opinions on In-N-Out versus Five Guys since they both actually taste pretty much the same to me. I came to this location because a friend in my group had never had the fabled In-N-Out burger before, and needed to try it while in Vegas.   The restaurant was packed to the nines at 11:30AM on a Friday. We barely managed to snag a table. The wait for the food wasn't too long, though. The burger was decent, but the fries were really disappointing. My fries were soggy and hard to eat--I ate barely half of them. My friends ordered theirs animal style, and the onions were quite undercooked. All in all, this was much more disappointing than my last In-N-Out experience in LA."}
{"text":"I like In and out burger.  The prices are reasonable.  the menu is simple. The burger is good. But I do have a problem with the massive lines and the seating. I assume that this is the way In and out burger is but I do not like to wait for a burger then have to scan the room for a dirty table that I have to wipe down myself."}
{"text":"I have not been disappointed with In-n-Out. It has always been my guilty pleasure during college. And man those animal style fries! If you don't know about them yet, you're missing out.  Very cheap place to get food if you're not willing to fork up so much $$. The only downside is that it isn't on the strip.  You have to come here when it's dark out to see the cool sign light up! You will not regret it."}
{"text":"This location has the BEST staff. So super friendly.. There is a lady named Victoria I think? She is so sweet! Of course the greatest burgers as well, I will not eat any other fast food burgers except for these :)"}
{"text":"It's true : Having grown up in California, I love me some In-N-Out!  It's definitely over hyped, but the food is consistently delicious. They do the best job of lettuce wrapping burgers around, make that animal style with my fries done extra crispy.   They pay and treat their employees much better than their industry counterparts, which explains the fabulous customer service.   Haha, give me a break, it's almost non existent ... At least at this location recently.   Seeing as this In-N-Out is by my office, it's convenient and I used to come here often when I was a young, dumb fool that thought it was OK to go out for lunch daily. I never remember having problems with my food or the employees.   Dropped in here last Sunday to grab a #2 to go: Animal Style, Protein Style, Extra Crispy Fries.  Kayla the cashier was beyond rude and made it visibly known that taking my or anyone else's order was a complete inconvenience to her.   I asked twice to make sure she noted Protein Style. Dirty looks and a yes. Practically threw my card and receipt back at me.   When I looked at my receipt, I saw it wasn't listed. Kevin calls me up to grab my order, and I asked if this was done Protein Style. He said no but would happily remedy this.   Usually Four stars for the food. Four stars for Kevin, ZERO stars for Kayla.   I don't come here very much, but I will likely stick to the In-N-Out on Chandler and Price from here on out when I decide to indulge.  Sorry for the two star rating, In-N-Out, but maybe you should consider removing this superbrat from a customer facing position or not hiring these types all together."}
{"text":"I haven't checked other reviews for In-N-Out, but I may be the only denizen of the U. S. who can't give it four or five stars.  I'm simply not impressed by the very limited menu, and its claim to fame, the burger itself.  Plain and simple, it's okay, but the single isn't much bigger than Mickey D's.  I like the minced onion in it, and the bun is good.  But I appreciate alternatives to fries, and here there just aren't any.  Not being a regular, I wasn't familiar with the items that aren't on the posted menu, but I knew one existed, so I asked.  The kid at the register enumerated a few things, and when hubby heard him say \"Veggie burger,\" he decided to go with a healthier alternative for a change.  When our food was ready, hubs dug in, only to discover that his veggie burger was nothing more than a lettuce and tomato sandwich!  The manager chided the clerk for not being more specific, and my husband ended up with an regular burger.  We came here because we were hungry, it was late, and we knew it was open.  But I remain unimpressed, and will not be quick to return."}
{"text":"Awesome Burgers! Not really down with their sauce so.. I prefer Ketchup and Mustard than the \"spread\" lol.."}
{"text":"I went to this In-N-Out burger twice while on vacation (I'm from Denver so we don't have any of these yet!) and each time I experienced wonderful staff and great food. The restaurant was very clean and the team members seemed happy and were all pleasant. One team member checked on me because he saw I had been waiting for a while - the restaurant was busy and my food came out shortly thereafter. I appreciated the friendly faces and comfortable atmosphere. This place was a true treat while on vacation!"}
{"text":"Always a good choice. I think this place is really attractive because it's right on the corner of two busy streets and their sign is visible right off the freeway. That's the only reason why we know about in n out over here otherwise, we would of never thought about coming here.  I also think it's really cool they have a merchandise store. In-N-Out always has cool stuff to wear but in California, they really don't advertise the clothing stop, I think it's really different being in Vegas  #SG #StreetGold"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that has not already been said. I love the burgers here, they are always juicy, fresh, tasty and made to order. I only get the fries when I eat in otherwise never to-go cause when they are cold they kinda go yuck. Service has always been great vs other fast food places inside and out in the drive-thru. Open late to 1 AM when I want a burger after work.  In-N-Out Rules!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out was the first place I tried in Tempe, and has been a favorite ever since. Truth be told, I wasn't even really into burgers before I tried them, and now I'm a convert. I go there when I feel like I need a treat (pretty often) and have brought several visitors from out of town for their \"must have\" meal. The food is fresh, quick, and filling. I love the retro feel and friendly service and quick lines always make it a positive experience.  My favorite thing is the shake - but burgers seem to be the most popular item for obvious reasons. A double double and some fries (animal style is what most people like) is sure to make any hungry person a much more happy camper. Don't miss this place! Just go!"}
{"text":"Every in n out gets five stars in my book.... man I wish they would come to the midwest already!!! Every time I go out west this is priority number one - double double animal style.  This specific in n out has a gift shop right next door, so thats pretty cool if you want to get an in n out tshirt or maybe flip flops...haha"}
{"text":"Location is a bit off the beaten path, but you have to make the trek over to try In N Out. I heard they're opening a location on the Strip which will be very convenient for future travelers.  Service was quick with nice staff. It was definitely busy, but we were luckily able to snag a clean table. Wait time was acceptable.  As for the food itself, I just wasn't impressed. I got the basic combo meal with the hamburger. I'd give the burger a 3/5. The bun was probably the best part, with the patty tasting a bit bland. The fries were a 2/5. They were a bit soggy and plain with no salt (although they do give you a packet to add on which I did).  For what it's worth the food did keep me full for a long time.   I'm glad I went to say that I tried In N Out, but probably wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"5 STARS!!! Yum Yum Yum.....Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom!!!! Double Double Animal Style Everything!!!!  I hate that this place is only available on the West Coast!!  I have seen that they have a place as far as Texas but come on....Open some over for us East Coasters!!!  In-N-Out Burger is 10 times better than Five Guys, does not have anything on McDonalds, and will blow Red Robin or any gourmet burger joint out of the water.  They use fresh ingredients and the people are always so friendly.  Its cheap and simple and it is always the best part of my trip to Vegas!!  Please come to the East Coast!!!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to eat when on the West Coast. There is NOTHING better than a Double Double with Cheese, Animal Style! I'm not big into the fries, and your order WILL take a while to be made, but it is totally worth it. I introduced my boyfriend to this while we were in LA and he's in love. Counting the days until I return to the US for that delicious burger!"}
{"text":"My first ever in-n-out burger here was amazing! The line was backed up around the store but it moved very fast. As I approached the cashier to put in my order, he made great suggestions as what to order (love the staff here, very friendly and helpful). I ordered the animal style fries, double cheese burger, and a chocolate milk shake. Their portions are huge and I got all that for less than $10! What a deal! I love in-n-out and I can't wait to go back to the mainland to get me some more!! :)"}
{"text":"Last burger with quality before Susie's 50's cafe or the Mad Greek. I would have not known of its existence if it wasn't for the yelp app.   We should all have an in-n-out near the freeway as we go home from long trips. It makes the road boredom a bit better with a double double and some fries animal style."}
{"text":"Love this place. Was my husband and 2 kids first time. Everything was amazing and you didnt have to spend $100 on 4 people for lunch.  I will definitely visit again. Wish there was one in Chicago."}
{"text":"This is not your traditional fast food place . The staff is always happy and has a smile . Be prepared to wait for a few minutes after your order - but don't worry ...it's totally worth it !   I ordered the burgers ANIMAL style - great ! The fries and burgers - fresh and hot ! The west coast is spoiled by having this franchise!"}
{"text":"By far the best burger for the buck!  My 3 kids and I grind here regularly for a little over $20.  And I've got two teenagers! God help me.  So it's not gonna appear on  any diets but so what?  Order an animal style, some fries and a chocolate shake and invite me!!"}
{"text":"The burgers are a 6/5 yea they live up to all the hype.  Cheeseburger, double double, triple triple. 4x4. Go see the secret menu before you order.  I absolutely love the hot peppers they were so good. I am personally not a fan of the fries, but hey this is coming from a french fry snob. I will be back over and over and over again... for the burgers NOT the fries."}
{"text":"No salt?  No friendly greeting in the drive through?  I am not too bothered by this since I truly love these burgers, but to eat the fries with no salt was a little brutal.  It was still good and everything else came out as consistent as normal.  Don't want to complain since I think they have a great system over at In & Out but someone has dropped the ball at this location when I came here the other day.  I'll still be back."}
{"text":"Classic N and OUT burger experience here in Clark County. RIGHT off strip. Convient to DaysInn Super 8 locals  Enjoy your Double Double with american cheese here.  Great fries from fresh spuds. As always  Seriously OFF STRIP, yet I still experienced personal safe buying here in an area that can get, ah, a little flavorful if you were walking around or parked with your car window open."}
{"text":"New location at Metrocenter mall, just like iain B. said....this area needs a stimulus in a bad way.  It is close to my office as well so I am happy to have this location nearby.  The burgers here are consistently great for the value.  I actually crave the consistent flavor of the special sauce, I tried the double burger yesterday but I have to say that the single patty isn't much meat but it is a perfect amount because it tastes great and of course I am consuming less red meat....which my wife tells me I have a problem, ha ha.  Anyway, great food, great service, great value ($5 combo meal), and now close to work.  Yippee!"}
{"text":"wait what? who reviews in-n-out and gives it less than five stars? in in out is as good as it gets when it comes to fast food. it smelled like heaven and cleaning products. seriously - it was spic-n-span clean inside and outside, and the bathrooms were just as clean at noon when i went. i ordered a grilled cheese animal style and a vanilla/strawberry shake, and it all cost me less than $5. the cashier didn't bat an eyelash at my custom order, and when i was done eating, someone even offered to take my tray away from me.   verdict: fast, delicious, cheap, and always satisfying. thanks in-n-out for being consistently amazing."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best fast food restaurants ever!!! Never had a bad meal here and always friendly staff. Be sure to look of the secret codes to order as they will make much more than what is on there general menu. Recommend the Double-Double with animal style fries and a drink. I hope one day they put one in Seattle, WA."}
{"text":"For those few people not familiar with In-N-Out Burger, it is a chain that has a very small list of menu items.  They make hamburgers, cheeseburgers, double doubles (hamburgers with twice the meat) that all come with lettuce, tomato, onion, and a secret sauce.  They also have french fries, sodas, and milkshakes.  That's pretty much everything listed on the menu.    However, those in the know can personalize their burgers in a surprising variety of ways.  My favorite option is protein style where the bun is replaced with a large pieces of crisp lettuce large enough to hold it all together.  Others will order theirs animal style with grilled onions, though I find this messy if you don't have a bun to absorb the extra liquid.  You can also skip the patty altogether and order a grilled cheese sandwich if that is more your thing.  I took a trip through the drive through at this location on my way out of Las Vegas.  I ordered my usual favorite - a cheeseburger, protein style, with ketchup instead of the sauce, with onions.  They made it perfectly.  The lettuce, onion, and tomato were crisp, and there was just the right amount of ketchup so that the burger was not dry nor was it soggy.  The fries were crisp, golden, and steaming hot.  I don't know what it is about the fries at In-N-Out, maybe the oil they're fried in, that makes them so tasty."}
{"text":"I love the burgers. I HATE, HATE, HATE The long lines......."}
{"text":"Always love In N Out and this location did not disappoint.  It is usually our first stop out of the airport and our last stop before returning to the airport.    I usually get the Single cheeseburger, mustard fried with just pickles and ketchup...yummy!!  Look for their secret menu online.  It gives you a lot of options!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love this place?   I'm not a fast food lover. I can't stand the grease and I definitely feel the after sickness hours or days after eating an over greased burger paired with super salty fries. In-N-Out however is the complete opposite. Perfect for when you're craving a juicy burger, minus the frozen fast food taste. You can literally taste the freshness, especially in the fries. And they make it the way you want it (animal style, grilled onions!)   This location is particular is fair, obviously, like any fast food joint you're going to run into a long line especially around noon/1pm..this is the closest location to my work, so I'll stop by during my lunch every once and a while and you can tell the line is purely from a high volume of customers - the employees are really working their butts off. Best location in town I've experienced as of yet!"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype of this place.  Maybe it's a west coast thing but the burgers were small, thin, and bland and the special sauce was whack.  Cookout is greater than In-N-Out burger."}
{"text":"These kids deserve a trophy for their lunch time hustle. Great manners, too! Never disappointed with the food or service here. Way to maximize efficiency!!!"}
{"text":"Boy is this place hyped up! Everyone talks about how great In-N-Out is...the anticipation was high. The burger was a complete let down. I mean Five Guys is much better...and their fries too. Animal style...not so good. I just don't understand the hype. The experience was cool though. Taking a cab to this place and then flagging a cab in the lot to get back. Seems like it's common since everyone inside cabbed it. It's very busy but I must say I was disappointed...booooo!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard... just like any other In n Out Burger: consistent food. Order was taken before I reached the drive thru system as the line was long."}
{"text":"hot days ,we very hungry))) and faund this places.very tasty and big hamburger, prices good, and cold deink woth ice)) i like this places.."}
{"text":"This location is way too busy! All the tables and chairs were take so we sat outside on the ground. If you are this busy you need to expand or put more chairs outside. There is plenty of room for it. However besides the big rush the food was just ok. They forgot to give me my drink and my burger took forever!"}
{"text":"nothing special about this particular location. Line is always crazy long but they move fairly quickly. Will go every time Im craving a fast food burger late nite!"}
{"text":"It's In-N-Out, what more needs to be said? I make a 9-12 minute drive to this location, as it's the closest to my home, every once in awhile because I crave their burgers and I'm not big on burgers-- or fast food much anymore. The line is always long, but it's worth it. Double Double of Awesome should be the name. And the service has always been top notch.   I know I will probably be cast away for saying this though, I'm sorry, I think the fries are overrated. Maybe that's because by the time I get back home, they've cooled down, but I just think they have a funny taste to them."}
{"text":"Ok, I apologize in advance to all of the fans of this franchise.  Everyone talks favorably about the food and every time I drive by, they are busy...someone please explain!  Maybe I'm just having bad luck. The first time I went, the fries were overcooked, and the burger was just ok. So, I thought I'd give them a second try. I mean, there has to be a reason so many love it.   So I went again a year later, and this time, the fries were not as overcooked, but still were just not that good. It's hard to explain, but they have a strange aftertaste or texture I can't place. I still ate them, but with catsup (which I NEVER use normally).  But the big disappointment was the burger this time. It was so dried out. I was wishing there was more of their sauce on it to make up for the meat, but it was just not there. Sigh.   Like I said, maybe this was just a fluke, 2 times, but I just don't get it.  There is almost a cult like following of fans for this place, and I'm sure I will be hated by many for my review.   But before y'all construct the noose, consider that I'm not a snooty foodie...I love almost every fast food spot and all the way up to 5 star spots. I have only given out 2 or 3 ratings less than 3 stars, so it's hard to not satisfy me.  Again, I'm sorry, but this place just does not do it for me.  Ok, I'm ready for my stoning now. :("}
{"text":"My favorite burger place hands down.  This is due to taste and price.  Only issue I have is that sometimes you have to fight for seating but that is because they are so busy.  I would stack this against any burger.  High end or hole in the wall, best I ever tasted.  Fresh as can be.  I have to get the fries well done so they are super crispy.  I also like my burger animal style.  Basically all the fixins.  These burgers are not greasy and the fries are freshly chopped daily.  From what I have been told, beef is never frozen and delivered daily.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Always gotta bring the fam here when they visit from the islands."}
{"text":"Crazy busy at lunch. The place was packed. Had to watch people eating waiting to pounce on their table when they were done. We tried the loaded fries. They came with fried onions and thousand island dressing. A strange combo but it works. If you want to grab a quick bite this place is fast friendly and the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Its been a long, long time and this place completely lived up to its hype! Simplicity is key! Burgers, fries, soda and milkshakes, no fancy nonsense here! We ordered a double-double animal style, an order of fries and a soda each, and it was glorious! Its probably a good thing these are only on the west coast because I would be a friggen house if it was near me!"}
{"text":"Memorial Day Weekend, 2011 will be known as A.INO 1 (After In'N'Out Burger).  My life before that was pure prologue.    I enjoyed my inaugural In'N'Out experience.  The double double with fries was excellent.  For me, what sets In'N'Out apart is the freshness of the accoutrements - the lettuce and tomato were crisp and delicious.  The beef and cheese were tasty as well, but as a Chicagoan, I've had the same flavors at Billy Goat and Wolfy's.  They, like In'N'Out, have excellent, fresh ground beef.  The fries at In'N'Out are superior in that they are thin and crispy - thin yellow fries a la McDonald's, but fresher, and (sadly) much shorter.  What is up with half inch fries?  But that is a minor quibble to their usability.  They were quite tasty.    What I loved most was the chocolate milk shake -- loaded with chocolate and very creamy.  A five dollar shake at half the price, and it did not even need the bourbon.  I won't go into In'N'Out withdrawal, but I was very pleased to experience it in the desert sun."}
{"text":"Biggest Hype Ever. Think of that movie that everyone told you that would blow your mind and when the credits began rolling at the end you were like, \"That was it?\" In-n-out Burger kind of is like that for me.  Before even entering this place is annoying because you have so many people bothering you for money. It's Vegas, I get it, but isn't fun dealing people essentially waiting for you to get out of your car to ask you for money. Then you go inside and you're in what seems like the longest line ever. Like a Disney(world/land) ride all for the burger and fries. Then if you eat in you've got to figure out where to sit. Good luck because this place is packed with tourist from all across the midwest essentially getting that elusive double-double.  So you order and get that double-double because it has that special sauce of theirs and some fries. I don't do it \"monkey style\" or any other of those weird secret menu things they may or may not have. I just want a burger and fries.  The burger is fine. Typical fast food burger, and I'll say that the meat is better than most, but the fries are the absolute worst. They are not cooked or something, like a soggy potato. Not good, not good at. I can't have a burger without having some fries with it and I can't eat these fries so I can't be a fan of this place.  So many bomb bomb bomb burger places in Las Vegas and I totally get that this is one of those, \"I gotta try at least once\", but I'm okay after that."}
{"text":"The hype was right. At 32, I had my first In N Out experience. All you west coasters are right to be uppity...their burgers are hands-down the best fast-food burgers out there.   I had tried to go to In N Out while I was in San Diego in December, but there aren't any there. When I went to Arizona in March, \"eating an In N Out burger\" was first in my list of things to do. I almost didn't get to! We were only in Phoenix one day because of the rain storms (wtf, right?) and then went to Sedona. Where there are no In N Outs. On the way back from Sedona (the only day of sunshine was the day we flew out), I frantically searched Yelp, 4Square, Google Maps, and the In N Out website to find one that was on the way to the airport.   This is it! \"It\" meaning the closest In N Out to the Phoenix airport if you're coming from the north.   My double double was perfectly cooked, had exactly what I wanted on it (and nothing I didn't want), the cheese was gooey and delicious, and the fries were very fresh. I only wish I hadn't had to wolf the food down to make my flight. I chanced missing my flight to eat this burger. What a sad fat-kid moment that would have been."}
{"text":"This place is CRAZY busy, even for an INO! The parking is inadequate for the size of the dining room, so you may have to park down the street. The food was as good as you would expect from an INO.....nothing to gripe about. If I was a tourist at the strip, I would probably come here, but if you are looking for INO, this probably isn't the location you want to choose."}
{"text":"Still LOVE IT.  I love the fact the drive thru stays open late. I was at a friends anniversary party close to In-n-out which was also on the way home and had to leave in time to hit the drive through.  There is nothing like a double double with fries before bed time.  I don't know what else I can say about this place other then it still and always has run like a well oiled machine.  They have a system here that ALL other places should emulate.   This place keeps people moving and yes when it gets really crowded it may take a few extra minutes to get your food but the order is 99% of time correct.  This is the ONLY fast food place I will eat at until I find a reason with their food that makes them bad, but I cannot imagine that happening.  It will be depressing but oh well.  Day or night, In-n-Out is AMAZING and I will hit this place every chance I have."}
{"text":"Great location with friendly employees. Insanely busy though every time I've come here. Great burgers with fresh ingredients and the French fries are consistently yummy."}
{"text":"Delicious, affordable and clean, In-N-Out always satisfies my hunger for junk food without feeling like Mayor Rob Ford after a coke and nacho binge."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is straight forward, cheap, and delicious. The meat is fresh, fries are cut on site, and milkshakes are glorious in the summer. It's no wonder that this west coast chain has gained a loyalty nationwide and has east coasters begging for this chain to reach the Atlantic. The menu is minimalist personified and I like that. You can a grilled cheese and animal style fries if your obese heart desires. I'm not a burger person, but when I do want a burger, I go for In-N-Out."}
{"text":"SEX ON A BUN!  Wow i love it! i live in Jersey, and the very first time i ate @inandoutburger was this one time i stopped in here. I wanted to see what the hype was all about. My cousin and i went there after we got the munchies after being in the pool all day. There was a line of people waiting but i did not care, i was determined to leave with a burger in my tummy. The sandwich was really good! it was very fresh. The fries i was not to crazy about, but i should have gotten \"animal style\". I loved it so much i am counting the days until my fiance and I go to California in June to eat at one of these restaurants. hmmmm hmmm goood!!!"}
{"text":"Another great place for lunch on the east side. It doesn't get much better than cheeseburgers and fries.  You can get it anyway you like it and the staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"What can I say?  It's In-and-Out burger and its reputation precedes itself.  Classic burger joint.  This spot is the most noticeable from the strip as far as I know, but deceivingly difficult to get to because it's on the otherside of the highway so you need to car ride it.  I've always felt their burgers were good---but nothing I can't live without as there are dozens of great burger spots all over Vegas---it's Vegas---great food is to be found everywhere.  Nonetheless, when that craving hits I'll git it."}
{"text":"Being from the midwest, any visit to a city with an In N Out is quite exciting! And now that we've learned our way around the secret menu, we know what to get every time. My hubby is a fan of the Animal Style Flying Dutchman and a Neapolitan Shake. I go for an Animal Style Cheeseburger with protein wrap and Animal Style Fries without cheese.  This location was great for us on our visit - friendly staff, efficient and clean!"}
{"text":"I finally got to experience the hype of In-N-Out Burger on a recent trip to Vegas.  This location is conveniently located next to the High Roller and it packed no matter what time you go in.  The staff does an excellent job of getting orders and dishing them out at a pretty rapid fire pace.    I ended up trying the classic burger with cheese and some fries.  I was not disappointed and it beats any of the burgers you'd get at the usual fast food joints.  I enjoyed my experience and wish they'd expand out to the east coast.  Maybe one day!"}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out...  You can never go wrong!   The burger are simple or extravagant- what ever your mood is. They got the secret menu to enhance the flavors and make your mouth drool. The fries are delicious and fresh, you literally see them cutting the fries while you wait in drive thru.  The only downfall about this establishment is its alway crazy busy which just means the food is that good"}
{"text":"For a fast food establishment the In N Out was immaculate.  The staff professional and friendly. I got the cheeseburger with all of the fixings.  It was very fresh and tasty, however I wish the burger was a little more thicker. Overall, it was a satisfying meal for the price!"}
{"text":"BEST BURGERS FROM A DRIVE-THRU!! Double, double with cheese - animal style!! Can't go wrong here!!"}
{"text":"No wonder the burger is only $2.50. Not filling, five guys is better. Atleast it wasn't greasy. And the workers are nice."}
{"text":"I simply must have in & out at least once a month.  After living in Jersey my entire life until now, I have an extreme appreciation for this place.    I mean, the food looks exactly like the photos on the menu!  You can only understand if you've ever eaten the fast food crap served up on the east coast."}
{"text":"We were on a mission!  We cruised around the strip....my friends gambled...I just watched the people who were very interesting....and then we were hungry.  I'd have to say, this is the first time I've been to Vegas that I didn't eat at a buffet.  But In-N-Out is always a good choice!  Finding this little haven is a bit of a challenge.  I had never been down this street, and there were a lot of shops and other restaurants, so it was more like an outdoor mini-mall and it was right next to the Eye in the Sky.  Yes, there is always a wait, and the area is a little cramped.  But this double burger and animal fries really hit the spot!  Considering I had a single $8 shrimp cocktail earlier....LOLLLL!"}
{"text":"They have the most amazing burgers. Fresh and to the point. The prices are great and you can't get a better service any where else. This location. On 215 and Tropicana is the closet to my house. I wish they had a Summerlin location.. but oh well, it's worth the drive"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru waited a long time the girl got our order wrong after repeating it to us correctly over the speaker, had to wait longer to get our fries animal style and then for the fries to be over salted. Not only that our burgers were extremely soggy and we asked for ketchup and spread, you think that'd be easy right? No ketchup just spread and chiles. Didn't even ask for chiles but did ask for ketchup. Horrible"}
{"text":"Always quick, friendly and every order is exactly what I asked for. I highly recommend them although the lines can get a little long it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"One day I met a girl who said she'd never been to an In N Out, even though she's lived in LV for ever. I think she was lying and was just saying that so I'd get outraged and take her there. It worked.   If you have not been to In N Out, then you need to go there right now. Seriously. Here's what you're going to get: a double-double with everything, animal-style fries, and a shake. If you don't know what animal-style means, then you need to get online and search for their \"secret\" menu! The actual menu only consists of a hamburger, a cheeseburger, and a double-double. Also, please don't be one of those people who goes there, waits in line for 5 minutes, then has no idea what you want when you're up. I'll probably be the guy behind you saying \"Really? There are THREE things to pick from!\"  Everything about In N Out is fresh. The meat is delicious, the bread is super soft, and the vegetables are crisp. For whatever reason, even their ketchup tastes better. The only thing I dislike a little about In N Out, and I'm aware I'm about to commit sacrilege, is their fries. They're good, but I personally like the fries at Wendy's or Jack in the Box more.   As reviewer Cathy L wrote, it's In N Out! Go there and eat!"}
{"text":"As a student at UNLV, I have a lot of food options. In the Student Union alone there are a few solid options (Metro Pizza, Panda Express, Subway...), plus the options within a block of campus (Jimmy John's, Aloha Kitchen, Chipotle...). Still, given all those tasty options, In N Out is the place to go.   In N Out has the perfect combination of factors that I look for in a place to grab food: the wait is relatively short, the food is great, and prices are reasonable. Plus, they're consistently good - unlike some of the other places nearby where you sometimes get a great meal and sometimes don't (cough Chipotle cough).   Now, let me get into what you should order in case you don't already know: Double Double, fries (animal style) and a shake. Sure, it's like 1500 calories altogether... but man you won't regret it at all. The burgers are really, really good, the cheese is perfectly melty, the onions and lettuce and tomatoes are perfect, and the bun is great, too. It's awesome. The fries, too, are probably the best fries you're gonna get. You can watch them cut and fry them, so you know how fresh they are.   Also, I love that this place is so close to campus. I mainly stay in the BEH building, so I'm already pretty close to Maryland Pkwy, which makes me extra close to In N Out. Win."}
{"text":"If you've been to one In N Out, you've been to them all. Delicious burgers, cute girls who work there, and a feeling of happiness when you leave there.   The meat is perfectly prepared, the produce is crisp, and the bread is perfect. The fries are ok, too. Also, if you've never been there, you need to search for their \"secret\" menu online. It'll open up your eyes!"}
{"text":"Note: My rating assumes that you are a beef-loving carnivore - steer clear otherwise.  Having never lived in a state in which In-N-Out operates, I always take the chance to visit whenever fate reasonably regularly leads me to Arizona or California.  Bible verses printed on their serving paper materials (which are thankfully unobtrusive) aside, I am all for this place. They pay their workers better than other fast food places and make everything fresh, and granted my experience is limited, but even though it may take a while to get my order, I've never had communication difficulties or an actually unpleasant cashier and I'm sure there's a correlation there somewhere.  The fries are shoestring style and salty; if you like heartier fries, stay away. The burgers are great with grilled onions (found in the \"Animal Style\" but can be requested otherwise.)   A word of warning that may not be stated clearly by In-N-Out's disciples - the burgers are thin, which puts off my parents who grew up on and strongly prefer half-pound burgers, but even they can appreciate the sub-$1 coffee.  That said, choices are pretty limited if you're vegetarian or don't eat beef, and the menu is very small. They do what they do very well, but it's not for everyone."}
{"text":"Every In-N-Out I've been to has always been accommodating. My friends and I had to grab some orders to go for our flight, so this was our stop. All the workers here had a smile on their face.   Anyway, I trust this location fully because I forgot to ask them to double bag my burgers and my burgers fell and tumbled on the ground of the airport as I was walking into my gate...but they remained intact and together. A miracle. Needless to say, I was desperate for my fix and I still ate them. Not ashamed because they were still heavenly. 5 second rule, amirite?"}
{"text":"I'm actually quite impressed by this location. There were 5 cars in front of me and I expected to be waiting for around 10 minutes. However, from the moment I ordered my food to receiving it, it took around 5-7 minutes, which I find impressive knowing everything is made fresh.   This locations doesn't skimp on anything. They game me extra banana peppers, extra pickles and extra in n out spread.   Thank you for this quick and amazing service!"}
{"text":"Clean place with good prices. The cheeseburger combo tasted great. The workers there are very polite."}
{"text":"I'm not sure there's any review I can give that will add much value. In-N-Out is already a well documented phenomena. Their restaurants are very consistent, both in terms of food and experience. But this is only my third visit to one of these restaurants and I'm just gonna add my voice to the chorus, which is to say, \"I came, I saw, I had a #1 combo with onions, and was pleased. Though I do think their fries could be a bit better. How is McDonald's the only fast food joint that has those nailed? That is all :)"}
{"text":"Well, what else is there to say about In-N-Out Burger that hasn't already been said.   You could work here for a week and have the menu memorized. It's pretty simple, but I like that.  This place is my first stop after the Rental Car Counter at McCarran."}
{"text":"How I miss thee In-N-Out. Everytime someone visits the west coast I specifically request them to bring me one of your burgers animal syled, but alas, they return empty handed. For now, I am content with the wonderful memories."}
{"text":"I love the food here.  I first had their food when I was in Las Vegas (i know.. not in LA) and the place was jam packed with people.  I think what makes this place so great is how simple it is.  Burgers and Fries.. that's it!    In-N-Out has the best fries out there.  Super fresh every time you order.  I mean dont get me wrong.. i love a good McDOnalds fry every now and then, but if you want fresh, this is the place.  Ive never actually been inside this one, but always do drive-thru"}
{"text":"In-N-Out has the best french fries next to... dont kill me, but Heart Attack Grill.. haha i know.. nasty huh.  They are just too damn good.  Why? Because they are fresh cut and not frozen quadruple fried french fries.  One of the reasons I love this place is that its so simple too.  Burgers and Fries.. that's it.  Their vanilla milk shakes are pretty rock too.    Ya can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Breakdown: Super busy Good service Good location  This was my only In-n-Out Burger experience, but thought I'd give it a second go around for the vacation. The service was very friendly, and accommodating. The place is very clean but seating is hard to find. This place gets quite busy because of its great location, so I suggest taking it to go! The food was okay."}
{"text":"Perfect as always In-N-Out!  Food does come it a bit slow like always but rest assured your food is cooked and served right off the grill!  Thank you for even dealing with our huge hoard crowd coming to get lunch during our break from our leadership conference over at the Thomas and Mack Center! Handled the rush amazingly!"}
{"text":"Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my lord, I need to move!!!!!  My life in the east coast just became utterly meaningless.  The pure fact that citizens out here have access to this burger from 10:30am to 1:30am any time in their lives is mind blowing to me.  That to me is like if I died, went to heaven and I was passing joints with Jesus while eating In and Out and not get fat, ever.  This burger is probably the epitome of all burgers you guys.  The satisfaction you get by eating this should make all your problems go away.  There is no other burger chain in this world that taste better than this.  And that is a fact.  My goal now is to figure out how I can relocate to the west coast to be closer to this life.  And if people ask me why I moved out here, my answer will be, to be closer to this burger."}
{"text":"I'm vegetarian but if I'm craving a burger I always just come to in n out and get their grilled cheese with everything on it (minus meat) add pickles and a fry. Cant go wrong"}
{"text":"Super busy, but super good, what else can I say? It's In-N-Out. Just need more seats outside and inside, but that's nothing new."}
{"text":"Disgusting! Went through the drive-thru and grabbed a quick lunch. Without looking I start eating my burger...hmm tastes a little salty. I finally glance at the burger and notice that it is completely raw. I threw it out immediately and will not be going back."}
{"text":"Burger was good but again, pricey. $7 for a single burger which is what I got. The fries were luke warm at best and it wasn't crazy busy. The burger was also luke warm so that was disappointing. The bun was also a little hard. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"I love this place!  My food always tastes great and the staff are always friendly! Order the grilled onions they are the bomb. I always like the food is super fresh and made right when you order it. They could make the protein style a little easier to eat but other than that I love in and out!"}
{"text":"If i'm ever out in the west coast i usually have to stop off at a In n out. This time in vegas was no exception. Near the UNLV campus you'll get a steady stream of college co-eds. Make sure you hit up the secret menu as you'll get some nice combinations that are off menu. I always go for a cheese burger animal style which comes with the in n out sauce which is relish mayo based with some chilli. As well as topping it off over fries. Yum. Great meat, juicy and flavorful. Made to order which always is a step up from the usual mcd's and burger king chains. Great shakes as well."}
{"text":"Always have been a fan of In n Out. This is my favorite location. Speedy, friendly service, consistently excellent food, and close to my work and home easily accessible from the road. They always get my order right, ordering for a family of picky eaters can be tricky sometimes LOL. A hamburger, double meat, animal style, protein style with fries well done is my favorite!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome.. I love in n out burger nothing compares.. typically I give places that are really awesome 4 stars.. but this paticular location gets an extra star.. do you wanna know why.. ITS BECAUSE OF THE LEMONS!! they are perfect.. go for the burgers.. but stay for the lemons.. they are cut so perfect I just want to squeeze them.."}
{"text":"Definitely the most awesome In and Out Burger in West Vegas. On W. Tropicana which is out of the way to most: a definite benefit for the sake of long lines. Love the fact that the staff has the secret menu down. Great service, super late hours, love it!"}
{"text":"Closer to a 3.5, this is my second time trying this burger chain and again, I was less than enthused. Yes, it's fast and fresh and the prices are great. But I just don't understand what all the hype is about. It's a solid burger, for sure. I'm just not one of their cult followers."}
{"text":"I love in n out! This one is the original in Las Vegas and it is still the best in town! Its always busy because it is right off the strip, but the food is always perfect. We have hit this place at almost every time of the day and it is always amazing. The French Fries at In N Out are never my favorite, but this location somehow always does them just right to the point where I forget I dislike the fries. That's saying a lot! The only issue I have with the location is that the \"Company Store\" is really lacking. You would think that something that is advertised so heavily would be bigger then a 10X20 closet... Oh well, Im here to eat not buy a jacket."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place. The employees are so nice and professional and the burgers are delicious. I love the fresh homemade fries. Why would you go anywhere else?"}
{"text":"yuck!!! what a disgrace!!!! im from cali and when you go to in n out out there you get what you order you dont get some half a** excuse of your order like you get pretty  much any where in vegas...Im guessin there just livin up to the vegas life style get the money f*ck the customers but hey thats just my opinion! well done fries means not soggy limp fries it means golden crispy fries just in case the staff doesnt know and protien style!!!...dont get scared it just means wrap it in lettuce dont fu*k up the entire burger!!!!omg this company prides itself on customer service so please do try this place im just sayin if this one is your first dont judge!!!!! there are better!!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for years now since they opened. The location is great, I've never had an issue with the employees, they are always nice and efficient. The food itself I've never been disappointed with. So delicious! And they never had an issue giving you some extra spread or pepperchinis to go."}
{"text":"I'd give this location more stars, but my last experience here wasn't the greatest. We received our food to go and went home. About half way through after eating my double double I noticed that the meat was just way too red, and against my better judgment took another bite and it definitely tasted raw-ish. Threw the rest away, very upsetting :/"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, it was busy and it was great!  I had a double combo with fries and a coke.  She had a grilled cheese with fries and a diet coke.  We finished our meal before we got out of the city limits.  One thing I learned is that they will set you up with a car tray to eat as you drive, that is awesome!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I really don't get why people love this chain so much.  That's great that the burgers are not frozen but when I eat them I don't get a good meaty flavor, all I taste is grease.  I very much prefer the sirloin burgers at Jack-in-the-Box.  And I don't like the whole \"secret menu\" concept.  Call me crazy, but I want to know what my options are when I walk into a restaurant, not have to study a website beforehand.  This place is just not my thing, I guess."}
{"text":"What's not to love about a grilled cheese sandwich, animal style? It's like a salad on a bun and costs $1.95.  I'll take two."}
{"text":"Absolutely exceptional service. I have visited a number of times but stopped in tonight with a group of 100 kids and parents. They successfully moved us through the line and made sure the tables were kept clean and available. The orders were right and the food was good. All was done with a smile and kindness. Five star restaurant quality when it comes to customer service. Bravo!"}
{"text":"In and Out never disappoints.  Although the line ran outside the restaurant, it moved quickly.  Our food was hot, fresh and tasty.  Plan to return."}
{"text":"Good burgers. I don't care for the fries. I like the protein burger. Instead of the bun, they wrap it in lettuce."}
{"text":"My wife & I came in with 2 other couples and ordered one after the other. Our order numbers were sequential. Their food came, mine didn't. I waited & waited, no food. I asked about my order and was told that they called my number several times and no one came up. I told him that my friends & I had waited at the counter and none of us heard my number. I got some grumbling and eventually my food. No apologies, no explanation, no thanks for being patient. My friends had finished and were ready to leave before I got sat down.   Usually I'm pretty impressed how well the place runs but this time they really let me down."}
{"text":"I love a double double, fries and hot chili peppers. after a long day of work.  I don't have a lot to say about greatness.  It Always hit the spot!"}
{"text":"My favorite hang over cure. A double double animal style w/ fries and chili peppers. There is nothing better than a greasy, great tasting burger + fries."}
{"text":"Everyone loves a good burger!  In n Out is consistent, quick, and always delivers. The line looks horrendous when you get there but it really moves fast. If there's a few people in your group have someone scout a table while you place your order."}
{"text":"Did not live up to the hype at all. Idk why it gets compared to shake shack on the east coast. First of all, shake shack and in and out are even in the same price range. Lol what I will say is standing alone it's a good burger for the price. Under $3. But shake shack definitely has more flavor and the food looks a lot better. But I will warn you this place gets PACKED!!!! but line moves at a decent speed. Oh yeah. We also got animal style fries. Nasty. Lol I could have made it in my kitchen with a microwave smh"}
{"text":"The burgers were ok...I really didn't see what all the hype was about.  Expect a long wait!"}
{"text":"Hands down -- In-N-Out is the best burger!  This is my favorite location.  Always great friendly service and open late.  My go-to order: a double-double with cheese, protein style, with grilled whole onions, a side of well-done fries and a chocolate shake. EFFFFF YESSSSS"}
{"text":"Let me begin this review by mentioning the fact that I've had In-N-Out plenty of times, but I haven't had an actual In-N-Out burger until very recently... I know what you're thinking. Girl, what do you even mean by that?  If you could kindly cut me some slack, I'm going to admit here on the Internet that (up until a few months ago), I have always been a wee bit of a burger snob. At most every burger joint, I would order a hamburger with nothing but the meat and bun. No lettuce or tomato, no onion or pickles and definitely no condiments whatsoever... I know. You despise me. You think I'm a weirdo.  On rare occasions, I'd try something new, but a lot of the time--just the meat and bun, like plain vanilla. And here at In-N-Out, I'd either have that or a grilled cheese, fries, and a shake.  After finally deciding to put an end to my picky habits, I marched over to this location and had my very first, real In-N-Out hamburger (not the Double-Double... Baby steps! Baby steps!)... And, god, it was freaking awesome. I now find myself craving In-N-Out a lot...  Yeah, this could be dangerous."}
{"text":"Looking for a real fast food service along with getting hot ole fashioned hamburger. The In & Out is a Christian family company and at the bottom of the rim of their cups has a scripture. This is the place to be, service is quick and busy. The hamburgers are ole fashioned broil grilled like you like, homemade original fries! You can go wrong here with a burger and fries."}
{"text":"Looking for that late night grub and what better place than in and out.  As I pulled in to the parking lot I saw the long line, but I knew from experience their service is really fast.  They did not let me down....I was in and out in about 10 minutes (no pun intended).  And like always, everyone is so friendly and you always get a smile!  Food never disappoints.  You know I'll be coming back again and again! 3x3 hold the onions please."}
{"text":"Always amazing food with exceptional service. Seems to be constantly crowded but the workers move efficiently and quickly, so there is never a long wait for your food. The atmosphere is mostly college kids and business folks on break, and you'll get speedier service if you go inside than the drive thru. I definitely recommend this location, since it's away from the tourist areas and quick."}
{"text":"Such a simple menu and very cheap prices.  its also a two minute drive from MGM which is where usually stay.  This is my late night go-to place after ive had a tiny $200 fine dining meal LOL"}
{"text":"The first time I ate at In-N-Out was when the chain first popped up in the Phoenix area. I wasn't too impressed. I had a plain cheeseburger, and it seemed like just your typical fast food burger. This was before I knew about the now not-so-secret menu.   I went in again to try their burgers again, this time ordering a cheeseburger- animal style, with a Neapolitan shake. The burger had a soft bun to go with the grilled burger meat, melted cheese, crisp lettuce and fresh tomatoes. Animal style is the way to go, because of the extra depth of flavor from the mustard-grilled burger, extra pickles, and chopped caramelized onions. The extra thousand-island type sauce helps too.  Compared to other fast food chains, you get a really good value for your meal here. The extra ingredients for \"animal style\" don't cost any extra, and the burger meat tastes way better than something similar for the same price elsewhere. The veggies were very fresh, as opposed to the wilted veggies you find in some places from burgers sitting out on heat lamps for who knows how long.  The neopolitan shake was pretty tasty. It's another \"secret menu\" item, and while I've never had a chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla shake all in one, this will not be my last!  I wasn't too impressed with the fries, despite being freshly cut and fried. They tasted a bit dry and crumbly.   Service was very friendly, and the cashier even gave me a cup for water while we waited the few minutes it would take for our meal to be made. Once we were done, another staff member came by to clear our table. Very nice service for a fast food place!"}
{"text":"Wow this In-N-Out was packed to the gills today! Despite the crowd of people, service was fast, accurate, and efficient. There were so many customers at 3 P.M. on a Friday that people dining in had to wait and keep an eagle eye on tables to open up. After trying in vain to acquire 3 tables with no avail, I finally snagged one after maneuvering my way to a table whose patrons had just left.  Even though we were eating at a fast food restaurant, I appreciated the fact that they had a staff member on hand only to clean up, wipe down tables, and take away trays as needed. He was very friendly and attentive.  As for the food, consistently good as always. My personal favorite to order is a protein and animal style burger with well done fries!"}
{"text":"This In-N-Out isn't as busy as the ones in Chandler and Tempe, which is nice since you can get your order made quicker as a result. Service is fast and friendly like the others, and our animal style fries and burgers were piled on with toppings, very nice! It looked like they added more fries to our order than at the other locations, which I appreciated. The only negative for me was that the A/C here runs very cold, so the cheese on our fries congealed into a cold mass soon after we got our order. Boo for cold cheese on fries!"}
{"text":"Wow, this In-N-Out was packed to the gills on Friday night! Despite it being so busy, there wasn't any wait to place our order, and there were still seats left for us to enjoy our meal. Even though they were slammed with orders, we still got service with a smile. Our order didn't take too long to get made, and soon we were enjoying our cheap yet tasty burgers.  I decided to go out on a limb and try something completely foreign to me in the realm of burgers- protein style (Substitute wrapped lettuce for bun)! I had it with cheese, and also animal-style. I shared some fries, well-done (i.e., they are fried twice instead of once), and a fountain drink.  The burger with no bun and lettuce wrapping was quite good. the crisp, fresh lettuce was a good complement to the hot grilled burger patty and condiments. Despite it being wrapped in the requisite paper pouch, it was still a messy meal as the lettuce does not soak up any of the grease and sauce like a regular bun will, so as I ate more, the paper got soggy and juices started to run down my hand and arm. While I really enjoyed the burger protein-style, I think a single patty just isn't enough for me, since I was still a bit hungry after chowing down so next time I will try it double-double!  The fries, when \"well-done\", are a whole lot better than their regular style. Frying them twice made them quite crispy, and the extra frying adds more flavor to the potatoes. I do appreciate that they use freshly cut potatoes though!  They are open late at this location- Until 1:30 A.M. on the weekends and up to 1 A.M. other nights.   Overall, a good way to start the end of your work week right!"}
{"text":"Another busy In-N-Out, but with fairly speedy service and consistent food. Our orders came out exactly as described. One minor detail was that the burgers were stacked vertically in our to-go bag, which made the condiments slide to the bottom of the burger when we came home and were ready to eat our tasty, yet as a result, messy lunch."}
{"text":"if u are a burger fan, definetely a most try...love the burgers and if ur not to fun of bread they substitute the bun with lettuce...pair it with animal fries...its perfect"}
{"text":"Wow this location is super busy. This is especially true at lunch time. I love that they have someone outside taking orders so that you can breeze through the drive thru even when the line is ten cars deep. They do a good job keeping it clean. The food is always amazing and never disappoints. I will come back very often."}
{"text":"Best fast-food burgers in the valley, hands down. The fries are amazing and can be cooked to your preference. Look up the secret menu."}
{"text":"Best fries and healthiest hamburger. No need for the cheese. The spread tastes amazing."}
{"text":"I'm quite into the cheeseburgers and I have wanted to get to In N Out for a looong time. Living on the east coast hasn't made that a possibility until last week.   Damn you In N Out burger. You were everything I was told you would be. My double double animal style was pretty much the best fast food style burger ever. Your sauce is unique and delicious. The mustard grilled patty is something I will have to try myself. The onions were all sweet and buttery. The bun, perfect. I hate you for not being anywhere near me. Its not fair.   The fries were nothing special. It doesnt matter. The burger was the specialist of the special.  As good as everyone says it is......"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE In-N-Out burger. Unlike all other drive thru food places they have a simple menu and seldom get an order incorrect.  Look into the \"secret menu\" items. Some are addicted to the \"animal style\" fries but I'm not one of them. I do love that they will cut the burgers into 4 pieces for my little ones. They also have grilled cheese on the secret menu.  I'm a fan of the strawberry milkshakes but I've also heard you can get a napoleon milkshake with vanilla, chocolate and strawberry."}
{"text":"Great location! The last couple of times that I went in there I brought my 2 year old twins (yikes)... But the staff kept them content with stickers and the hats. I honestly can't stand going to sit down eat with kids since it's stressful. Maybe it was the stickers or the French fries but my little munchkins loved this place so now they get a strawberry shake if they behave.  Bribery works like a charm! (Don't judge me!) The food is always great at IN N OUT. Fresh and not a long wait. Last time my brother ordered a 4X4 and if u don't know what this is then u need to check it out! It's 4 burger patties!! Yes, 4!! I will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"In-n-Out Urge takes over and I need those freshly cooked French fries, cheeseburger topped off with a strawberry milkshake and I'm in fast food heaven.  This location is conveniently located right off the I-17 and always busy. The drive thru line extends around the building and is always so long but in the end it's worth the wait. The food is NEVER less than expected.  Some swear by the \"animal style\" fries but mine are delish just plain.  The menu is simple but that's all they need."}
{"text":"Mannnnnn my first in-n-out! I'm 23 and I had never experienced this heaven sent restaurant until about a week ago.   Ordered a Double Double, side of fries, animal style fries, a chocolate shake, and a strawberry shake  The man taking our orders was so fast (and nice.) But he didn't make us feel rushed or anything. I literally went to go wash my hands in the bathroom and then my husband was already picking up our food! Very fast!!   And holyyyyyyy ghost it was delicious. Like I'm so glad I'm moving to AZ where these are all over the place. And gyms too, luckily they're all over the place cuz yeah ;)"}
{"text":"This is our favorite fast-food joint when we travel out West. The burgers are awesome and the prices are reasonable. Restaurants are always clean and many have outdoor seating.   Fries are skinny but good. Other fast-food restaurants have better fries, but these are still good."}
{"text":"I have friends that rave about living in and out burger.  I have to say it is a great late night stop. Are the burgers so good I would come all the time.  That is a stretch. Very limited menu to what they do best. Burgers fries shakes."}
{"text":"God compels me to eat In-N-Out. He might not be compelling me to eat a 3x3 animal style, but the biblical references on the wrappers and cups are conclusive evidence that he (or she) approves my fast food consumption. When it comes to Vegas locations, the Blue Diamond offers a fantastic experience that is worth whatever time out of the way it might be.   The menu is simple. Its a burger that you come here for and the object of ordering at INO is to order off the \"secret\" menu or to try and stump or surprise the staff with a new concoction. If you think you are up to the challenge, try the 3x3 or the 4x4 which is exactly as it sounds three patties and three slices of cheese or four patties and four slices. Getting anything (except the shakes and your soda) \"animal style\" is clearly a must. Animal style throws on a slice of cheese, a thousand island style spread and onions.  The shakes are creamy and flavorful, don't even hesitate if the thought pops in your head to mix flavors. I personally enjoy the neapolitan. If shakes aren't your thing, be sure to get a icy cold coke, it goes beautifully with the burger and fries and just soothes your soul.  Service is good and the staff are incredibly spot on. The orders came out perfectly despite the complexity and the lines moved at a nice pace while still offering attentive service. It clearly puts its other fast-food counterparts to shame.  I mentioned that it is worth the time out of the way. If you happen to be visiting sin city, the Dean Martin drive location near the strip might be the easiest to get to, but the wait might be a little long for your liking, especially when the pangs of hunger should strike. Head south for about ten minutes and it will be well worth the effort."}
{"text":"I walked across a highway to get here. In Vegas you have the misconception that you can walk to anything. Maybe it's the giant signs creating the illusion that you are closer than you really are or maybe it's the 3 Bloody Mary's I had before 9 AM, but I would recommend taking an Uber next time, turns out not super close, but still same animal style great taste! This place has long lines down to a science so don't let it scare you."}
{"text":"Was the second person here today and my boss showed up ten minutes later in the drive thru and him and about 10 other people where served before me and all I had was a large number one. Big man at front counter was awesome though and friendly. Whoever prioritized the tickets is absolutely useless"}
{"text":"It was a special request from one of my buddy during my last trip to Vegas in July.  The burgers are really good...not too greasy.  I had the double.  The fries could use some help...they tasted hollow.  One bite and you're thinking to yourself, 'hey, where's the fries?'.  Sorry but McD's fries are better.  The service was excellent and quick!  The place was crowded as usual but what do you expect at In-N-Out?  We just need In-N-Out Burger to come to Washington State!"}
{"text":"In & Out.  If you're missing your gallbladder like I am, In & Out is appropriately named.  LOL  BUT, as a treat every now and then, I don't care.  Though, I'm sure J would love it if we went more often than not.  One of my favorite things about - Cheese paper (cheese thats stuck to the wrapper that you peel off)!!  LOL  :D    Our burgers -   Mine - Single with cheese, extra toast (on bun), add onion.  J's - Single with cheese, extra toast, add onion.          Double - Double, extra toast, add onion.   Reasonably priced food.  J says that the shakes are pretty good.  The fries - Meh.   Skip the fries!!"}
{"text":"I just visited this location and the staff was extremely friendly, pleasant, greeted you as you can into the restaurant , a very pleasant experience. The food was great, fast service, and the restaurant  was clean and not packed."}
{"text":"I have been to IN and OUT Burger about 20 times probably.  It all started in 2008 when a friend brought me there for lunch.  It was game over after that.  The closest thing i can compare the taste of the food to is i guess 5 Guys Burgers, but it is way better than that.  The secret menu is really no secret anymore as during my last couple of visits the cashier reeled off several items from it.  The service each and every time i have been to this place is exceptional.  The employees are very patient and very helpful.  A trait that you will only see in fine dining settings in NY and NJ.  The place is always clean even though every single time i have been in here it has a line of at least 20 people long.  Keep up the fantastic work IN and OUT!  5 stars hands down, *The best fast food in America by far."}
{"text":"I can't believe they opened an in-n-out on the strip! Place is really clean since it's so new. Food was bomb diggity of course! Animal style burger and fries on point... with a strawberry shake to the wash It all down! They were super busy but honestly what in n out in vegas ever isn't? They're were probably 30 employees working so ordering and the time for food being ready was fast. Everyone was super nice. So glad they opened another location especially on the strip! \"In n oouut... in n oouut .. That's what a hamburgers all about!\""}
{"text":"When I am not out yelping new restaurants and diners I'm keeping it super simple and adding my own toppings. My go to on a lazy day is in-n-out because I can order the Flying Dutchman. It is two grilled patties with cheese, I add onion and I'll take it home and eat it with asparagus or zucchini or whatever fresh veggie I may have in the fridge. In-N-Out is a staple in our household we are both from California and must eat Here at least once a month for the past 15 years. I know the east coasters have five guys and steak and shake but there is nothing like the thousand Island sauce and animal fries that you can get here. Nothing comes close and nothing satisfies the craving. This location also, is my favorite because Ray Road tends to get extra crazy busy.  Wrapping things up just know I have a love for this place and they keep it so West Coast and so simple and I appreciate all of it."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love In-N-Out? Simple menu. Delicious burgers. Decent fries.  One thing about this place - it is ALWAYS packed. You can thank the location's proximity to the strip and probably the fact that a lot of tourists don't have In-N-Out where they're from. Be prepared to wait a while for your food. It's worth it of course.  Not much more to say that you don't already know. Never been? What are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"In n Out always rocks.  Their stores are always super clean & the kids that work there hustle.  Too bad other fast food chains don't do the same."}
{"text":"Our favorite lunch spot. Fast. Kid friendly & amazingly good. Outdoor seating. Perfect location! And you can't beat the price!!"}
{"text":"You let me down, in n out! My friend ordered the french fries. They should change the name to \"hypertension drenched fries,\" as they were overloaded with salt salt and more salt. I ordered a \"chocolate\" milk shake, but chocolate syrup and vanilla ice cream does not a chocolate shake make! Please don't think I can be fooled...especially when you hand me the cup and it's got some pink \"strawberry\" colored stuff dripping all over the lid! Yes, I sent it back because \"the eyes eat first\".  Oh, and last I checked strawberry is neither chocolate OR vanilla!  Grr! This place is arguably  the busiest In n Out in Vegas, but does that mean I should sacrifice quality? Me thinks not!  With only about  5 items on the menu it should always be done right!"}
{"text":"OH HOW I LOVE IN-N-OUT BURGER!    I'm not going to talk too much about In-N-Out Burger because you don't go there unless you already know ;).    The only drawback about his location is that the drive thru and the inside is often very busy no matter what time of day."}
{"text":"They can cook burgers pretty quickly but seem to have difficulty at the window managing the flow of orders in and out. 15 minutes sitting for a burger with fries is too long. Can do better at other locations."}
{"text":"First and foremost, let me justify why this is 4 stars and not 5. It is certainly not because of the food, service, or cleanliness. It's because of the amount of seating available. I totally get that there is probably a standard size that In n out aims for and there's reasons that I don't understand for the amount of seating available, but c'mon In N Out! People love you!! You get super crowded and anytime around lunch there's pretty much nowhere to sit!  If you're just getting your burgers to-go or you're doing the drive thru then don't worry about it. The service is always super fast and friendly. The burgers and fries are great and not sloppily put together (like I've had at other locations).   I probably shouldn't hold the seating thing against them, but this location has been here for a while so it's time for a patio expansion (at least)."}
{"text":"Hell yeah! This is my kind of restaurant! This In and Out has great customer service AND the service is fast!!! My friend and I came here for lunch last semester, and I was back at school within about an hour or so! Friendly staff and delicious food as well make this place all the better!"}
{"text":"If you are going to have a fast food hamburger this is the only place to get it!! In-n-Out is by far the freshest burger on the market. You also notice that there employees are similar to Chick dil Et in that they are bright fresh faced young people who are articulate and polite and clean. Unlike BK and MickyD they seem to make a strong attempt to have great employees. Fries here are wonderful. Get some!!"}
{"text":"The double combo was very tasty and inexpensive (less than #7). The people at the counter all had smiles on their faces and seemed to be very glad to work at In-N-Out; they apparently get very good training.  Nice end to a long day."}
{"text":"Why spend a fortune on burgers at Johnny Rockets when you could have them just as great here for a fraction of the price?   For 2 burgers, 2 orders of fries, a vanilla milkshake and 1 order of animal-styled fries (with grilled onions, thousand island dressing and cheese), our total added up to less than $15 and it fed 3 very hungry hannahs - stuffed and contented!  If you're a first-timer, you will find the menu a little too simple - at least that was what I thought 3 years ago when I was new in Vegas. Don't be too quick to judge. What makes In-n-out so interesting is the fact that they have a secret menu (envision a burger entitled 'the flying dutchman'!) and you can have it at a snap of a finger. Everything is served fresh, all the braches I've been to have been spotless and the staff always have a bright smile on their faces. At the same time, you get this whole 60s diner feel that I instantly associate with Johnny Rockets (and thus the comparison) every time I enter, only not with the dancing staff.   Great place to take the family after church service, or hang out with a group of friends. Their milkshake is made from ice-cream by the way, so just a heads-up, sipping it through a straw may not be the easiest thing in the world."}
{"text":"Sunday night I went here and bought $25 dollars worth of food and idk why but I've always bought food from other locations and the food great but that same night my 5 year old started to throw up and I started to have a fever. The worst stomach pain ever. I think the meat was under cook. Will not go back to this location again."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge * 68/100  While Mickey D's burgers are paper thin and taste like...well, cardboard, In-N-Out's burgers are juicy and succulent!  This 50s diner-esque fast food joint offers a simple menu with an extra fun & not-so-secret menu that you can explore all over the internet. On days when my tongue is not so accommodating of sliced raw onions, I'd call for the animal style cheeseburger which includes the same basic ingredients - burger patty, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese - with pickles, sauteed onions and dressing. Add a shake to that and you'll have bundled up enough calories to earn yourself a good work out for the night.   But I digress.  I absolutely love the speed that comes with each order and the efficient staff. Place is always well-maintained and people keep coming back for more. You can now say goodbye to other burger joints. This is the place to be."}
{"text":"Burger was good and service was nice. Environment was welcoming and the staff was very nice, despite being busy they had our food out to us in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I'm not really a burger person.  The kids enjoy this place.  The boys enjoy the double-double no tomatoes and onions, I'm guessing the secret sauce is good.  They claim the milkshakes are the bomb diggity.  A double-double for $3.65 they way these kids eat I spent $23 bucks and that's without drinks but I guess I would have spent more and these guys got two burgers a piece.  Idk if I'd rather feed them or clothe them.  ugh!! P.S the fries taste weird, like fake potatoes or some crap"}
{"text":"Want a hot steamy fries and a great cheap burger come here!  In n Out won't disappoint.  Loved this place ever since I was little when we could only get it on vacation in Cali.  Thanks for bringing it to the desert!"}
{"text":"Never been to In N Out until last week Thursday.. I must say the wait was well worth it!! I got animal everything because that's what all my friends said to get and I loved it!! There was this waitress named Rosa and she had the best customer service ever!!"}
{"text":"Still one of the better burgers in Vegas. Still the best \"fast food\" burger in Vegas. I order my burgers a little different than just load it up. They have never made a mistake on my orders. I LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Always Fresh, always consistantly great. They have never failed me. I love the burgers and the fries. Always a good deal and always yummy in my tummy!"}
{"text":"My only complaint?  You can't get a chicken sandwich!  Just kidding.  This Cali staple is delicious and if you rock the \"secret\" menu you can customize your meal to your specific liking."}
{"text":"Mind blowing fries, burger and one of the best shake. I would totally recommend to try it."}
{"text":"It's kind of embarrassing to come all the way to Vegas (from San Diego) to eat In-N-Out. We wanted a cheap first night so we can be a bit more splurg-y the rest of the weekend, so IN-N-Out it was.  Apparently a lot of other people thought the same because there was a decent amount of people here at 4pm in the afternoon (too early for dinner).  Luckily with my too close for comfort stalking skills, I was able to snag a table for me and my group just as someone was about to leave. As in I stared them down while they hurriedly clean their table for me :)  The cheeseburger I got was pretty standard. Good as always. Cooked well, bread a tad crispy on the edges, fresh tomatoes and lettuce and just enough sauce to flavor it. Fries were good. I loaded them with black pepper and they were good to eat! (that's an understatement if you know how much black pepper I actually eat). And I got my usual half pink lemonade/half sprite mix.   Overall, it was a good first meal of the trip even though the BF literally lives down the street from one in SD.  Oh, and try the cheeseburger with the chili peppers. It gives it really good flavor and spice kick! Be careful of the seeds though (and I tell you this from experience)."}
{"text":"You want fresh, you came to the right place! The buns are toasted to perfection, lettuce is fresh and clean and so are the tomatoes. They put this special spread that makes the burger YUM YUM GOOD! and for your onions, you can either get it grilled or just plain.  I have been going here since high school days, when you want that after school bite or a place to hang out with your friends. Love In & Out! The prices are very reasonable and the customer service is awesome! They are quick and have an organized way of serving their burgers. Either it's slow or even busy, they know how to compose themselves and keep their cool. Doesn't matter the location your at, their dining area is always clean and maintained!"}
{"text":"I'm from NY and to try one of these nonexistent-in-NY chains was in my todo list.  I was recommended to get a #2, which was a cheeseburger and fries and I had substituted the soda for a milkshake.   I was NOT a fan of the fries. Fries should be good my themselves, prior to any condiments. Seasoning after the fry is a different story. These were just freshly cut potatoes and fried. Nothing special.  The burger was okay. It was on par with Wendys. Not craveworthy. Just a simple cheeseburger.   Price went for $5.99. Much cheaper than what I'm used to."}
{"text":"First time eater of the in and out burger i had high expectations. Line was short but took a very long time to get our food tons of vegetables on the burger awesome .. but where was my feiggen burger ? Literally the thinnest piece of meat iv ever gotten from any burger place.. also they don't tell you that they have somekind of mayo thousand island dressing sauce they just soak your burger in . Also the fries wernt the best .. Ill stick with wendys that's how much i disliked this place ."}
{"text":"Whoever is taking orders in driver thru at 5:15pm today just doesn't listen. I didn't say chocolate, I said strawberry. I didn't say I wanted to eat in my car so when the boy at the first window asked if I wanted place mats & I said no, doesn't that mean I'm not eating in my car? It wasn't the girl at the third windows fault, except when she didn't ask if I needed ketchup so I had to ask after I was told to have a good day. nobody was listening from the beginning. I've been in customer service for 5 years. Wasnt too great just now."}
{"text":"In-N-Out, how I love you.  Always fresh, place is always immaculate.  Employees are always incredibly helpful and friendly even when my bf tries to entertain them with his cheesy jokes and quizzes them on the secret menu, and his interpretation of it."}
{"text":"I don't see the big deal. Service was nice, but my food was ok. Yes, I ate it without meat so that could be a reason, but even Five Guys has a better vegetarian option and you can have mushrooms. I had two sandwiches animal style. I don't think I'll go back since I've tried it and can cross it off my west coast food list."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with in n out!! I love it, inexpensive and good!! Have been going to in n out since I lived in California."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is, in my opinion, the place to go to get awesome burgers and fries! If you go during normal lunch or dinner times, it's going to be busy and you'll have to wait a bit. Trust me though, it's totally worth it! This location has a nice parking lot and plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. The resturant is always nice and clean.   My \"go-to\" is a Double-Double Animal Style with fries and a vanilla shake. The menu is really simple as well. I think that their shakes also don't get enough credit as they are super tasty!  I love me some In-N-Out Burger!"}
{"text":"Always busy love it here but hungry worth the wait with Sista love from Boston! First place she goes when she arrives here and cheats here and there when she's here then goes there before she goes back home!! I've been eating in and before it was started!! Hint... Circus Room ole downtown Vegas!! Yay yay"}
{"text":"Sometimes it is the simple things in life that are 4 stars. Take In N Out Burger. They have turned dining out into a simple experience. In N Out specializes in three sandwiches: a hamburger, cheeseburger, and double cheeseburger in addition to fries, Coke beverages, and shakes. It is simplicity in dining that is delicious. In N Out burgers taste freshly made. Missing from In N Out are microwaves and warmer lights.    This past Saturday after exploring Craig Ranch Regional Park and hanging out in The Cannery my brother and I were up for a simple 4 star meal. The Cannery failed at that. It was now 11 p.m. And so we decided to meet up at the In N Out Burger a couple of lights from the Cannery and off the Interstate 15 exit. The abundance of parking and lighting gave me a simple first impression. It was an impression that would develop into a 4 star rating. The restaurant met my standards in cleaniness. The cashier was welcoming. In back of the cashier, the people cooking the burgers were in plain view. I appreciate the fact that customers can see the food being prepared. The time between ordering and picking up the food was 8 minutes. Yeah it wasn't exactly fast food, however, the taste exceeded fast food. An In N Out cheeseburger and fries is worth waiting for. The cheeseburger with lettuce, tomatoes, and onions was thick and tasty. I could believe that the burger was not frozen and microwaved. The fries were good, but in my opinion they cannot hold up to Chick Fil-A's or Nathan's.    When it comes to eating out, sometimes I am a fan of  simple dining. I will be checking into an In N Out Burger in the near future."}
{"text":"3 stars:  Good  This review is one man's opinion. And this man's opinion is that In N Out Burger is good.   They let my brother and I inside minutes before the posted opening time of 10:30 a.m.(I assume they don't sell breakfast). It was surreal being the only customers in an In N Out Burger considering they are usually packed. The employees were friendly and hardworking. There was none of the horseplay that I could expect in a fast food restaurant when only a couple of customers are inside.    I ordered the standard cheeseburger meal. With a selection of three meals, the choice was an easy one. Because they make the burger upon order, it took a few minutes from order to eating. No complaints.     In my opinion, the cheeseburger was good but not the best. The fries were decent.    When it comes to fast food, in many instances the ratings of their food is one person's opinion. This person's opinion is that In N Out is 3 stars."}
{"text":"When I yelp, I bark animal style. When I dine in In N Out I pass over animal style and enjoy a mouth watering cheeseburger & fries.    Speaking of animal style, in the fast food jungle, In N Out is an animal with the style of simplicity and efficiency. It is delicious fast food made simple. With the exception of a secret menu, there are only three meals to choose from. A hamburger meal, a cheeseburger meal, or double cheeseburger meal. It is simplicity made fresh. Forget about ordinary burgers being left under warm lights or frozen patties warming up in a microwave style device. At In N Out, they cook the burger right there and in front of the customer.    Delicious fast food made simple is brings me inside the Blue Diamond Road In N Out Burger oftentimes when I am in the vicinity of the Target in the parking lot. Lol. Sometimes I go out of my way to do an errand in this Target just for an excuse to patronize In N Out. The thing is, it seems that on any given visit hundreds of people are also patronizing In N Out. The upshot us that I am rarely in n out. But then again I always dine inside. Regardless that I might be number 240 and they are serving customer 186; efficiency speeds up the wait. Due to supply and demand, In N Out is so popular that finding a table is as difficult as finding a cold day on a June in Las Vegas. Just like at any In N Out; I consider myself satisfied sitting at a bar chair.     On the subject of crowded, I observed that at In N Out; customers rarely seem agitated or annoyed. Ditto for the employees. The employees here are even friendlier than at casual dining restaurants that I have experienced. An example is last Saturday when I dined here, a friendly employee went up to all the customers asking how the food was and making small talk.     In a City where there are countless restaurants to dine in, In N Out is the ultimate option. It is upbeat, inexpensive,  and delicious. When it comes to yelping this In N Out, I give it a 4 star bark :-)"}
{"text":"The late 1940s saw the birth of two icons. In 1946, the first Las Vegas Strip mega resort the Flamingo opened. Two years later the First In N Out opened in 1948. Fast forward 71 years after the first Strip mega resort & 69 years after the first In N Out there was finally a link connecting the two icons. This link is spelled Linq. A couple of weeks ago, the Linq made headlines when this location opened as the very first In N Out on the Las Vegas Strip.     The first In N Out on the Strip is drawing in the crowds. And the demand is exceeding supply. The famous red, white, & yellow colors adorn a an average size eatery. During peak times there are insufficient  booths and patio tables. This was the case last time when I left disappointed. In hindsight I could of ordered to go then walked nearby to the Wildlife Habitat to have an In N Out picnic in the company of flamingos, ducks, and exotic birds.     The next week it was a different situation. On a rainy day we experienced the sunshine of In N Out when startlingly there were vacant booths. In N Out is fast food sunshine on a cloudy day & anyday. I have yet to see a gloomy employee in their restaurants. During the grand opening era, employees opened and closed the door for me. Now if I needed to use a restroom they would open and close the door for me because there are no restrooms leaving me  to use the public  one in the Linq. Across from the door in the open kitchen there were at least 29 employees greeting customers and creating the food.     Comparable to all In N Outs ordering is done with ease. The menu features 3 burger items that include lettuce, tomato, onions, & a thousand island style sauce. They are also offered as combos that include a medium Coke beverage and fries. The prices are higher than the other locations yet a bargain for the Strip. My cheeseburger combo came to less than $10 around the price of a beer on the Strip. It was $ well spent. Contrary to its namesake the food is never \"In N Out\" of a microwave or fryer. It was freshly made from the time of order causing a good few minutes of anticipation. The In N Out sunshine that permeated the delicious burger & fries was worth it.      In conclusion I anticipate a perpetual extraordinary busy In N Out. I foresee patronizing the local In N Out and leaving the a booth for the out of towner that craves In N Out. Now if there are a few available tables, there will be one for this local when he is craving In N Out."}
{"text":"Long have the West-coasters lauded the magical In-N-Out. Long have we Midwesterners and East-coasters hung our faces in humiliation at our wretchedness. But hark! Midwesterners! East-coasters! Gather 'round and let me describe the wonder in terms that ye all are familiar with!  The best way to describe this place is with comparisons to other fast food places. The most relevant are Shake Shack and Steak 'n' Shake.  It's burgers are very similar to both, but probably more so to Shake Shack--they're pressed thin, with almost \"crunchy\" edges.  Natives love to order off the \"secret menu\" or whatever (Google it), but I just got a regular burger with extra onions as well as fries.  These burgers are good, but not as good as Shake Shack.  Whatever (incredibly unhealthy) sauce Shake Shack puts on their burgers really just makes them heavenly, and In-N-Out just isn't QUITE on that level.  Very comparably quality-wise with Steak 'n' Shake burgers.  The fries are great, but at the same time, not so great.  As a friend so aptly described them, they have a very detectable \"cardboard\" quality to them.  You'd think that would make them horrifying, but in reality all it does is make them slightly subpar compared to the competitors.  The cooler they get, the more this quality becomes obvious.  Order them for yourself if you want to understand--they're still quite decent!  Most importantly, although In-N-Out doesn't quite cut it compared to Shake Shack, it's like, half the price.  If you're not bougie (or rich) and want a regular fast food place, In-N-Out is where it's at.  For the price, it can't be beat."}
{"text":"Hands down the best fast food burger chain. Nothing beats a Double Double meal Animal Style with a side of spread. No reason to use ketchup when you can dip your fries in the delicious spread.  I would hate to move to the East Coast because I'd be lost without this place."}
{"text":"This place is a gem!   I adore everything on their menu but really love their fries with melted cheese on top and the single cheese burger. Nothing. Better!   Plus the service is great and it's always consistent! Lovvvee."}
{"text":"I'll give their burger props, it's good,  but nothing special.  The fries are literally like cardboard, won't ever order those again.  Five Guys blows them out of the water.  Sorry In N Out burger."}
{"text":"My wife loves this place, she loves that all the food is all natural.  The only fast food place she will eat.  That is good for me..   Great job in n out."}
{"text":"Had my first 2x2 Animal Style and it was delicious!   I tried the the fries Animal Style, but it may be a bit over the top. If I'm looking to gorge, I may get them well with just cheese. The special sauce was a bit much... though they were all eaten by the end of the meal.  It's too bad they don't have one of these in NYC... though Fresh & Fast is an exceptional substitute. I think it trumps Shake Shack."}
{"text":"A decent fast-food burger, fries, and shake. While sitting here, I saw them cutting the fries fresh! Throw the potato into the machine, pull the handle, voila--fresh-cut fries. Nice to know they are fresh:)   This crew was pushing out the rush of orders so fast. Much appreciated. Fast, efficient service is rockin here.   Would return any time."}
{"text":"Doesn't matter which one you go to, the food is all good.  Double Double Animal Style and a chocolate shake!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and it was super busy packed but as always the service was top notch and I was able to order quickly. My food took a little while but it came out fresh and good so I can't complain. Post ordering I asked if I could get a bigger sized shake and I was helped immediately and two or three employees asked me if I was being helped already while I waited. Great customer service and always great food. But man I wish the ketchup came in the animal sauce sized packets."}
{"text":"In-N-Out has a loyal following and for good reason. Unlike other places, when you hear the name In-N-Out, you can expect good fresh food.  There are 2 classes of burgers, the thin patties, simple, clean flavors which In-N-Out serves. Then you have the restaurant gourmet burgers that tends to be big beef patties with lots of ingredients, more complicated, flavors aren't clean though. Both are still delicious. This is like arguing over Deep Dish Pizza vs Thin Crust pizza. Note that to pull off the simple flavors, it requires to have really good ingredients, which includes good meat patties, cheese, and veggies. In-N-Out usually does this well.  Like most other In-N-Out locations you usually will get great food and service. But the couple of times I went, I have some not so perfect service and food for In-N-Out standards. Despite this, it is still a lot better than some other fast food places.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, burgers, shakes, or fries. But things get interesting when you start ordering off the secret menu.   What I order now is: 3x2 Protein Style No Salt w/ Grilled Onions and Animal Style Fries. 1 less cheese makes it less filling. The lack of salt keeps the burger from drying out. The protein style is really so you can taste the ingredients, since the buns just get in the way. If executed properly, you really taste the burger and won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Im from the East Coast. I've heard a lot about this place. I shouldve gone to Burger King. They didn't have mayo and menu was limited."}
{"text":"Was not impressed.... Five Guys and Shake Shack are so much better. The signature sauce is the coverup to the burger (it's there filler since the burger is so thin). While in Vegas if you want a burger... I mean a REALLY good  burger go to Bobby's Burger Palace.... you will enjoy"}
{"text":"So the service has always been great but the line is always long no matter what time of day. Their burgers are a million times fresher than McDonalds or Burger King so it's almost worth the wait. If the wait wasn't so long I'd be more loyal. This last visit took so long it was rough while having kids in the car."}
{"text":"It's In-n-Out.  What more needs to be said.  Family owned, excellent food, wonderful service.  Makes me feel at home even when I am on the road."}
{"text":"As many of times I've been to Las Vegas this last trip I found out about this place. Nothing fancy. Just a good old fashion juicy burger fries and shake will hit the spot. The pricing is very shocking for such a tasty burger. I highly recommend this place when your in town."}
{"text":"Every one loves In-N-Out.  We were with first-time visitors to the area and they wanted to stop at In-N-Out.  So, we did.  It was exactly noon so you know the line was long inside.  It was also long at the drive-thru.  However, we still opted for an inside seat.  The line moved fast and the fresh burger and fries were served fairly fast.    It's a typical fast food restaurant  but we normally love the sauce, the fries and beverages especially the diet lemonade.  Hamburger doesn't quite fit the bun.  It's small, of course.  Sauce is delicious and fries were hot.  However, there was something missing with the fries this time.  There wasn't much flavor and no seasoning at all.  Have they changed what they cook them in or what?    I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt with the fries this time.  We should rate them 3 but I'll give them a 4."}
{"text":"The double-double cheese burger animal style is good. Not a big fan of the fries they are a little to healthy for me. It you want a burger and do not want to get out of the car and do not want to go to McDonald's this is your spot.   When I eat burgers I want a good burger so I do not go to In-N-Out very often.   This location is often busy too so there is always a little bit of a wait."}
{"text":"Everytime I visit the west coast area, this is my must go to place right when I arrive! Of course we have plenty of great tasting burgers down in New Orleans where I am from. But In n Out burgers have their own special taste to it. The best thing to order would be animal style. The burger was juicy and the fries were also good. The fries hardly have any salt on it at all, which I love. Makes me feel a tad bit healthier eating them...lol  There are other types of burger styles too such as a double or veggie style. Overall awesome place to stop by and grab burger and fries."}
{"text":"Whenever I fly home from Ohio, I try to hit all my favorite restaurants in the valley. And I generally get to each of them once. I get to In-N-Out at least twice. It's just that good. I honestly could eat it every day of my life if my waistline would allow it."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for so long and bringing all my out of town friends and family every time.  I am happy that there is a new one on Sahara right near me now."}
{"text":"Right off the plane if you're around here go buy \"The Animal\".  I love this little place.   It's quick and simple.  The staff is not grimey and ghetto.  This location is busy but you don't wait more than 5 minutes.  The milk shakes are bomb too.   I love coming here to this specific location when I visit Vegas.  Who wants to get into a Gud-food coma? This spot needs a 6 rating."}
{"text":"I have made a point to get here on each of my trips to Vegas, and it never disappoints.  The burgers are inexpensive, the fries are amazing, as are the milkshakes - and of course, there's the whole secret menu.  I'd like to be able to go here more often to really explore the combinations of what I could do to the secret menu - but I find myself perfectly content with a double/double animal style with extra everything (sauce, pickles, lettuce, tomato and probably other stuff), well done fries with animal sauce (love that cheesy thousand island goodness), and a rootbeer float (covers both my beverage, dessert, and kicks the caloric count up another 1,000 points or so).  Theres a reason this place has so much lore to it - if you havent already, make it a point to go there.  Also, you can have your taxi go to the drive thru - I dont think any cabbie in NYC would do drive thru, plus everything is made fresh and takes under 5 minutes to be served.  It would be nice if this place was a little closer to the strip, but walking back to the hotel post gluttony is a pretty nice way to burn off a miniscule amount of the meal while seeing the real vegas in all its seedy glory."}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out.  We actually were in a cab ride (back from some casino or something) when we took a trip through the drive-through and picked up some burgers.  I'd likely eat there every meal if I could.  Though we picked up to eat at our hotel, I'd imagine service for eating in would be just as fast - we were (literally) in and out very fast, and did I mention that I love In-N-Out?"}
{"text":"Ok, I do love this place. It's just fast food so I don't know why...maybe just a vacation thing...don't know but I really do. Here are some possible reasons:  1. GREAT service..always friendly and is that not a rarity these days especially fast food???  2. so inexpensive for some really tasty food.  3. hooked on animal style...the sautéed onions...the pickles..the sauce...what's not to love???  4. the milk shakes are super good and don't taste \"fake\" like all the other fast food chains where I won't even get a shake.  5. the fries are real french fries...not frozen things thrown into the fryer...some sit down restaurants don't have fries this good.  6. this location (the only one I've been to) is kept super clean.  7. and the most important reason...to me at least...is the fresh brewed iced tea...super good and makes the whole meal even better.   Well, until this chain stretches to the east coast, I will just have to love from afar...absence really does make the heart grow fonder and I would really like to have a number 2 animal style right about now...."}
{"text":"Still the best staff and customer service of any of the fast food chains, and excellent food as well!"}
{"text":"This is my Burger place to go the Best Double Double with Everything on it. Alex was very patient with me when he was taking my order although it is getting hot outside. Elda the cashier got a ready smile very nice this is what you call Double Double good customer service."}
{"text":"Double Double - Animal Style with fries and a drink please.   If you've just picked up someone from McCarran and they're hungry and haven't had In-N-Out, this is one of the closest locations to introduce them to one of the small perks of living so close to California. Most of you already know what to expect here so I'll just say the line moves fast, and they don't squawk about making items off the \"secret menu\".  4 Stars: It's In-N-Out. They really can't do any wrong here. (I wish it was a bit easier to get in and out of the parking lot but that's a traffic design issue, and not In-N-Out's problem)."}
{"text":"There's a reason for the long drive through line. It's called a Double Double, and it's literally a sublime experience. The pricing is great, the fries are fresh cut and taste great (sometimes need a bit more salt though) strawberry shakes are spot on, and once you pay the place is glassed in so you can see inside and not wonder how your food is being made.   I tried Five Guys, I came back to In-N-Out. There are many who offer burgers...but order that Double Double Animal Style and either you'll hate it, or you'll think it's the best thing ever and most fall into the latter category fairly quickly. Brave the line. IT'S SO WORTH IT! And the service is always impeccable. I've NEVER had a bad experience here or a messed up order either."}
{"text":"Double Double Animal Style for the burger only, fries, and a Strawberry Shake.   Sometimes nothing satisfies quite like a good double cheeseburger. And if you're going to sabotage that diet you've been on then you might as well go big or go home.   The drive through lines go faster than you would expect. And it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy! Best burgers and fries! Make sure you get them angry ;) it's off the strip which is good... they're quick, polite, and the food is great and fresh!! This is a must try, especially for tourists."}
{"text":"This is a good place to eat lunch if you work close to this fast food restaurant. they always get my order right and the service is fast."}
{"text":"Even though they were busy, they filled the orders quickly. Food is always great. Good to see they have not jacked up the prices since they are on the strip."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas last week and it was day 5 into my vacation out there and I really missed California, so I decided to eat here.  As always, it was delicious!  They didn't disappoint at all!   I always order the following:  #2 animal style fries and animal style cheeseburger with the spread on the side.  my drink of choice: lemon-up.  YUM.. I think I'll have this for lunch today. :)"}
{"text":"On the spur of the moment we decided to grab a quick lunch and ordered cheeseburgers and a small fry.  After reading so many rave reviews of this franchise, I was totally underwhelmed.  The burgers were the smallest and most overcooked I have experienced since my last visit to a Mickey D's and the fries were wimpy. I subsequently learned you have to order them well done if you want crispy.  I wonder what segment of society prefers wimpy over crisp?"}
{"text":"I'm from the east coast, so you know I have to compare it to Shake Shack... Shake shack still tops this place food quality wise. But In-N-Out's price definitely can't be beat. I gave it three stars because I love fries, but theirs wasn't good. It was very stale tasting and the cheese tasted like kraft american cheese melted on the top. The burger was good, but the bun itself was the best thing of the burger lol. I had a strawberry shake, which was super thick so I had to wait like 10 minutes to drink it. The shake was filling on it's own haha. It was good though.   We tried the drive-thru which gives you a pretty cool experience to eat in the car because the food is given in like a readily prepared box with condiments, the food, napkins, etc. It was like a genuine old school experience. I'd definitely be back.  PS. I wrote it's not good for groups because it was often super packed that there were no seats available for groups larger than 4."}
{"text":"Great Service. Our cashier Michael W. was amazing and friendly. The Great service and amazing food is why I will always come here."}
{"text":"This place was so delicious for a fast food burger. Definitely worth the wait, I had fries, a strawberry shake, and a single plain cheeseburger. We came early to avoid the line, and made it just in time before the line extended out the door. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"All I can say is....protein burger....yum! At first I wasn't a fan of the fries but now I love them."}
{"text":"Burgers good but they got our order wrong two out of the last three times we were there"}
{"text":"IN-N OUT rocks. What else can I say?  There is always, always a super duper long line here in the drive thru and sometimes you wait for 10 minutes and sometimes up to 30. But you know that information going in. You always have to wait at IN-N-OUT and that is because it is all made to order. At least the wait is not as long as Fatburger.  Employees are nice and it's a good location, you can drive in and out easily."}
{"text":"Very crowded In-N-Out. But the staff was very efficient and friendly. Typical In-N-Out fare. We both had cheeseburgers and fries."}
{"text":"This place is always packed, and always delicious. They're open super late which makes it the perfect late night hangout with grub next to ASU. The drive-through line routinely wraps throughout the entire parking lot so it's almost always a faster option to dine in."}
{"text":"I think there's no bad In and Out. They are always consistent and friendly. Can't go wrong with a classic cheeseburger and their famous fries. Drive through is really easy at this location. Will be back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"As a CA transplant, I have known about In-N-Out Burger for some time.  Still, after all these years, they are my favorite burger joint.  The staff here are always so happy and helpful.  They never seem tired of their job or lack a friendly face.  It's always a pleasure to dine here."}
{"text":"What can I say about In and Out that everyone doesn't already know? Not much. It's delicious and it manages to \"hit the spot\" every time. We have experienced the drive-thru and dine-in options at this location and the service has always been phenomenal. You absolutely feel the enthusiasm everyone has for the place and the product. Everyone is very nice and you always feel welcome! Oh, the food? SO, SO good. I usually order a Double, Single (two patties, one slice of cheese) Protein-Style Burger with onions and fries. It's the perfect burger. The one slice of cheese adds the right balance of flavor without being overwhelming. It also doesn't hurt that this burger is simply $3! The fries are not at the top of my list and I don't care for it separately, but when you eat it with your burger, it's the perfect combination. So when I'm in the mood for a burger without the fuss and wallet-raping, I'm here!"}
{"text":"like every in n out that I've been to, the service here is perfect. I'm sure the corporate headquarters have them trained down to the tee."}
{"text":"Been to a few In-N-Out Burger joints and thought I would hit up the first one of the strip.  The food was just like every other In-N-Out that I have been to.  It was good but nothing special.  Service was slow.  I did order cheese fries but that put about 10 people that ordered after me getting their food before me.  Considering that it wasn't like food was flying off the line that was a little much.  Given all the other places in Vegas that I love to eat at not sure that this will be a spot I visit again.  If you have to try In-N-Out either because you are addicted or have never gotten to have it before this isn't a bad option for you since it is walk-able from everywhere on strip."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to this In-N-Out burger, I start becoming religious and just pray that I get back out to my car before I get rat-a-tat-tatted up!  The food is mediocre.  The burgers are good but of all places that I've ever ate French Fries at, this place makes the worst.  The only good thing is the menu is small so you can make your decision quickly with one eye on the menu and the other eye watching your 6 (that means behind you...if you didn't know)  The first time I dined in the joint, a family was arguing about fries versus no fries to the point of them almost having a food fight without food.  The second time, a lady was flipping out and I thought we were all going to get rolled up on.  I think my frustrations with this one is just the location.    On the flip side of this, the employees have always been more than friendly and very professional.    In-N-Out burgers are good, but I'd strongly recommend hitting up a different one."}
{"text":"Don't stop at the Double Double order the fries animal style too! On a busy weekend don't be afraid to be dropped off by a cab you are not the only one with the same idea, it's almost like a cab line out front.  There is additional outdoor seating at the In-N-Out store next door.  If you are a party of two please share your table if it's crowded but no one expects you to share a booth."}
{"text":"The burgers are good but the plain fries are tasteless so I would recommend getting them with toppings. The chocolate milkshake however is quite tasty and perfect to help cool you down on a hot day. I would come back for only the burger and the milkshake but Wendy's is way better."}
{"text":"I'd say this place is just a normal In-N-Out Business. You get the same treatment, the long lines, similar food quality and burgers, and the overall satisfaction of getting something in your belly after a long drive.  My friends and I stopped by this place on our way from Tucson, AZ to Los Angeles, CA and she was craving \"animal style\" fries so we had to stop by here.  If you do decide to make a pit stop at this place, I'll warn you now about the parking. The flow of traffic in and out from this restaurant business is awful. Lines build up and just finding parking in their small lot is a nightmare. We came around peak hours, unfortunately, and luckily found a spot in the corner to walk inside and order. I believe we got there around 12:30pm or 1:00pm and I never wanted to get out of an In-N-Out so badly until then. Haha.  But I digress. If you want a standard burger and fries that'll curb your appetite, this place is always the place to go to. It's conveniently located next to other shops and stores (like Taco Bell and Walmart), and is just off the freeway. How convenient!"}
{"text":"The on fast food I will ever eat! So good, maybe  in-n-out should expand into the Midwest aka Indiana!"}
{"text":"Food is always good and the staff is pretty nice. My only gripe is sometimes they mess up the order or things are missing ( i don't always check my order because i feel like i shouldnt have to, it's not that complicated). If that weren't bad enough when i call the restaurant it's a corporate number and can't talk to a person at that location. So basically you can't come back to get the food or get a credit. in N Out i hope you're reading this. This is a flaw in your system!   Foods good but get this right it'll help and I'll update my review!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this place, I have been eating at In-N-Out since I lived in Cali. 16 years ago. and this is still my Favorite burger Joint.also make sure you get your burger  \"Animal style\""}
{"text":"This was my first ever in-n-out burger experience and I 110% don't understand the hype over this place. Really? The meat is absolutely tasteless. The fries are limp and taste like cardboard. The buns are super stale. Gross. The only reason they get an extra star is for being clean and friendly.  Maybe this was a bad location? I'm only giving them one more try when I go back out west."}
{"text":"A born and raised Californian, I will always love In-n-Out. Their burgers are 1000 times better than Sonic, and it's so cheap and delightful! I used to hate the fries when I was little, but they've grown on me."}
{"text":"What can I say? Always a good idea. Well done fries and grilled onions. A chocolate shake and you're set. What more could you desire in a burger place?"}
{"text":"Who can can be critical of a fastfood burger joint that knows its stuff?  Always hit one of these places when I am a part of the country where they can be found."}
{"text":"It has been 18 months since I had my beloved In-N-Out! Like my boy Charles wrote in his review, it was fitting coming from Maryland to eat at S Maryland Pkwy location.  We ended up eating here twice on our 3 night trip.  First night -  #1 Animal style w/ Animal style fries  Last night - #1 Animal Style  That first bite was the bomb!  I really miss eating here.  I will save my usual 4x4 for my Official San Diego Trip in August!"}
{"text":"Overrated. I would probably chose it over McDonald's or Burger King, but I fail to see what makes people go totally apesh*t over this place. The burgers are good, don't get me wrong, but they're nothing like what some people make them out to be. And what's with the lack of condiments? Blasphemy! Oh, and \"spread\"?!? WTF is this garbage that you're trying to pass off as an acceptable substitute for the variety of burger toppings that, for reasons I'm unaware of, aren't available here? Whatever this crap is, it's nasty.   Fries are average, and their shakes are ok (mine was a bit thin and runny). Reminds me of a low-budget Steak'n'Shake, which has MUCH better shakes and a lot more variety on their menu. (if only I could transplant one of these bad boys from the midwest...)  Again, even after eating here numerous times, I still fail to see how this place could even come close to living up to the hype. Sure, the whole \"secret menu\" was a genius marketing gimmick, but this place is mediocrity at best. If I want the best possible \"fast food\" burger, I'll go to Culver's which is far superior and gives it's patrons what we deserve...some freakin' choices!"}
{"text":"Well this lived up to the hype. For about $4.00 you get a truly excellent burger. Although it was cooked well instead of medium it still retained it's juiciness.  I thought there was a little too much salt on the patty. Not so much I didn't still wolf it down. The fries were standard, not bad but not memorable.  While places like DuMont or Royale make better burgers, I've never had anything this good at this price point."}
{"text":"Friendly and efficient service! Their burgers  animal style is always a big win! Fries are light and not greasy. The vanilla milk shake was also good."}
{"text":"This place gets a thumbs up from me! Good burger, good fries, and they moved the long line relatively quickly. Have I had better YES, but did I enjoy my lunch YES.  We couldn't figure the best way to walk there but a taxi ride was very inexpensive and there are literally a couple taxis waiting in the lot to drive you back to your hotel.  It was a good lunch that I liked"}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service! We are so impressed with the employees at this In-N-Out. Everyone is moving and doing one or another task. They keep everything stocked and clean. This will continue to be our favorite lunch place. So far we have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Located on HWY17 on exit 223.  You'll pass this spot if you are heading to Sedona.    If you are out of town and visiting, make sure you stop for one of their DoubleDouble burgers. We stopped here and hit their drive thru for a quick meal before getting to the airport.  Service is fast enough and the burgers are good. I would ask them to put less cheese on the burger the next time.  The taste is easy to describe, a beefy beef burger, with crispy greens, onions and a soft butter bun. Its the anti-McD burger.  You can actually taste all the individual ingredients, from beef to tomatos to the buttery bun.  Everything is made fresh, and their fries are hand cut and fresh fried.. not the frozen McD stuff.."}
{"text":"Wow! This place was crazy!  The food was great and the line moved really fast for how many people were in this little place at once.  Look up the secret menu before you go! Ask for free stickers if you try something off it.  I had a burger combo with animal style fries. Yes animal style!  Animal style is this thousand island dressing with onions in it that they put over the fries and even on burgers I think.  I didn't like it..  But the burger was really good!  Don't go in the bathrooms, it was a wreck in there and one was broken!"}
{"text":"-The BEST fries in the whole wide world!! Cheap too!  -I LOVE these hamburgers, it's worth waiting for! I envision the toasty buns, secret sauce, and greasy goodness as I slowly wait my turn in line.  -Good location, right off the freeway.  -Service was friendly, just like any location.  -I learned there's a Jersey Mike's in the same parking lot, as I waited in the Drive-Thru line.  -I found this location with YELP's help."}
{"text":"you should already know about their food by others.  I'll focus on:  Drive through - a bit long, I would suggest to go inside during lunch Food wait - faster than most In n Out (even during lunch) Clean - very clean.  I always see people cleaning the doors. Ketchup - All you can pump! Napkins - All you can take."}
{"text":"I have been in LA a few months but haven't been to In and Out.  Since we were in Vegas with our friends from home (Chicago) they wanted to hit up In and Out, so we went.  It was good!  Cheap!  Just took a while to get the food cause they were soooooo busy!  And I got a Chocolate shake with my combo (hey might as well go fatty all the way) and it was SO GOOD!  Even better than a Wendy's frosty!  Now I am worried as there is an In and Out 2 blocks from my home...."}
{"text":"Burgers are very good.  Getting the  order correct BAD BAD BAD.  Always check your order when in the drive thru before you pull away from the window.  Getting back in line after being in line 17 minutes not an option finding a parking space to go inside also not an option."}
{"text":"It's In-N-Out and that automatically garners 5 stars. If you make me explain it to you, you're a lost cause.  I'm pretty sure having this joint so close to ASU is part of the reason why we have so many out-of-state students from California; I can promise you that it was a factor in my decision to uproot from San Jose to Tempe for these 4 glorious years of college, but I digress.  You want to know the meaning of life? Get a double single with grilled onions and chiles and that should get you pretty darn close to figuring out the answer to that. Get it protein style if you want the flavors to really pop."}
{"text":"This is for all of you people who live under a rock and do not know what In N Out burger is. It's delicious.  I would end the review there but let's do this. This location is located right off the strip and should be the first destination when landing in Las Vegas.   I typically get a single burger animal style with fries animal style with a strawberry shake. Why the animal style you say? BECAUSE IT'S LEGIT! Go to in n out's website to find out all the different styles out there. Go in. Try it and if you didn't know to try it. NOW YOU KNOW."}
{"text":"How do you review an In-N-Out? Great food! Great service! Simply the best fast food restaurant there is...period. Of course 5 Guys has a better hamburger...but they are quick serve, not fast food."}
{"text":"I don't even review In-N-Out's based upon their food anymore. Their food is always great. So the question is \"how good is their service?\" Well, I have not yet found an In-N-Out where their service is not also very good or great. So...what can I say other than just go. If you have never tried an In-N-Out, where have you been?"}
{"text":"Smashburger is my second favorite quick serve hamburger (after Five Guys). Their burgers are always great. Good milkshakes (even better than Five Guys) and this one is no different. We ate here and the hamburgers were perfect...as usual."}
{"text":"I am not sure if people even read reviews about In-N-Out, I mean why would you? Lived in a cave and never heard all of the hype? Want to see what type of fool someone might make of themselves as they write the review. It's an In-N-Out! Just go!"}
{"text":"Google for the \"secret\" (off-menu) styles of ordering your burger.  Animal style/protein style, etc.  Great service, well run place."}
{"text":"There isn't much to say. Excellent fresh burgers and fries! This is one of the better fast food places, plus its dirt cheap. Oh and if you've never tried your burger \"animal style\" please do, it's part of their secret menu."}
{"text":"3.5 stars~   Walked all the way here from the strip. Arrived in a famished state, since the walk took a lot further than we thought it would. Not my first time at In-N-out. Burger was good but the fries are not that great... kind of tastes like cardboard. But the service was quick and the employees found time to clean the tables between seatings even though it was so crowded. Definitely a place we visit during trips since we don't have an In-N-Out in Washington/Oregon. Super crowded at this location!   Don't forget to ask for a hat :)"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic In 'N' Out Burger!!  The sign will draw you in (HUGE!).    As usual, the food is fantastic!!  And it's VEGAS BABY!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of fast-food beef, so I get the grilled cheese. It comes with lettuce, onion, tomato, and the sauce. I like the fries with onions and cheese. So good and so worth the wait."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is always one of our first stops when we arrive in Vegas. This time while in town, we dined here twice.   Other than the food taking a super long time (it was not busy), the food was consistently delicious. Hot, fresh and yummmmy. Double Double and Animal Fries is the way to go. Friendly staff. They are very aware of how long the lines are at all times and communicate well as a team to get peoples order very quickly and efficiently. And as always, great value for the price!  Small parking lot, not very many spaces. The drive-thru line was minimal at this location, but I imagine during school hours it is very busy."}
{"text":"This place is the super-slammo. You probably already are down with In-N-Out'sky, but if not -- do pop in for a Double-Double Animal-Style and regular Fry. Water cup for me usually, but the shakes are awesome, too.   Check it!!"}
{"text":"Solid spot! Love In-N-Out! Really interesting they all look exactly the same. The line does get really long a few times throughout the day so be careful and come at a good time!"}
{"text":"The only place I go when it's cheat day. And by that I don't mean \"secret-tryst-over-a-sesame-seed-bun\" cheat day. The lines and hubbub about this place are well-deserved, and a lot of people just don't get it because, as another reviewer put it, it's just burgers and fries.  But it is in this simplicity that In-And-Out wins me over. The menu consists of only three combos, ordering is straightforward, the army of white outfits don't fuck about. I don't consider this a \"fast-food joint,\" as you never get your order under 15 minutes. But then again, you know the greasy slop has been lovingly hand-crafted and carefully fitted into the little paper sleeves Just For You. You don't get that kind of commitment with Mickey Sleaze and the Creepy King. And I'm all about commitment.   Unless, of course, it's cheat day and I slam two double doubles with extra fries. Sigh. They're also open late....but if you're hella starving you're better off hitting the other aforementioned spots.   Proper atherosclerosis takes time."}
{"text":"It's In N Out. Burger always comes out the same. Which is a good thing. Just don't ask Hot and Juicy."}
{"text":"Best burgers around, why can't we have them on the East Coast? This place is always crowded, but always worth the wait. Everything is cooked to order, and nothing is frozen. The prices are very reasonable and every restaurant is very clean. including the bathrooms! They must be good if this is what is served at the post Oscar parties. Anthony Bourdain even raves its his favorite restaurant in LA. only located on the West Coast and just recently in Texas. If you are ever here, check them out and see for yourself! Animal style!!!!"}
{"text":"If your always on the hunt for great burgers then you probably find these high -mediocre at best.  Try the regular menu before seeking out the underground toppings.  However,  these prices are fucking amazing!!"}
{"text":"Wait time wasn't long and food was great!  Give me a double double with animal fries!"}
{"text":"Just saw a review complaining about a long line in the drive through. I was in that line and I want to clarify there was someone at the front giving the employees a hard time. It's never like that on a normal basis."}
{"text":"The best fast food burger... period! It is worth the small wait for them to make your food so that it is fresh. The burgers are deliciously seasoned and the addition of raw onion makes them so delicious! The milkshakes are also thick and tasty."}
{"text":"Gotta love In N Out! This place is always busy, but this location does an excellent job with speed of the drive thru. They have a partition set up so the waiting cars don't block the parking lot. They had an employee standing in the drive thru taking orders ahead of time to speed up the process. I got through the line exceptionally fast, considering there were about eight cars ahead of me. The food was delicious, as always."}
{"text":"Food comes out a little slower at this location, but the service is efficient and nice. Love my usual grilled cheese with tomato, lettuce, onion, and pickles.  My husband got the 3x3. My sister got a double double protein style. Perhaps because of these personalized meals we had to wait a little longer, but it was totally worth it!   I also loved going to the Sprouts market across the parking lot afterwards."}
{"text":"So I was under the impression that a hamburger is a hamburger is a hamburger.    First, I went in to use the bathroom.  Ugh...I have bathroom nightmares and partial phobias of gross bathrooms.  I was not impressed with the cleanliness.  However, the place seemed to be of high traffic...but then again...so are all the other In-N-Out's.  I got out of there as fast as I could and jumped in line to order.  \"Can I get one cheeseburger (light on the onions), one hamburger, and one order of fries?\"  She said, \"Sure.  Ok.  So one cheeseburger and one hamburger - with no cheese?\"  Uhhhh...what??  Yeah.  One cheeseburger, one hamburger, and fries.  She said, \"So one cheeseburger light on the onions, one hamburger, and fries.  So no cheese on the hamburger?  Right?\"  (Say what?!? OMG...I thought to myself.  Am I saying something different or what?  Ohhh...candid camera??...looking around...nothing).  I don't understand!  One cheeseburger and one hamburger sounds different to me.  So confused!!  I guess next time I'm going to order and say:  Can I get one burger with cheese and one cheeseburger with no cheese.  HA!  I was finally able to dewrinkle my forehead after I started eating my burger with cheese.  Oh so the burger with cheese was delicious as usual...shiny soft buns, crisp bun on the inside with multilayered lettuce crunch, full sized slice of tomato, juicy burger, melted cheese, and sauceeeee.....that's it folks!"}
{"text":"Oh, In-N-Out, I curse you and thank you at the same time for not being on the East Coast.  Curses because I crave you but can't have you.  Thank you because being to close would be too tempting.  I'd have to dig the fat clothes out of the back of my closet.    I love that you have stuck to your family roots and not sold out to Wall Street.  I love that you manage to keep normally apathetic teenager employees happy and enthusiastic.  I love that you give me an In-N-Out sticker for free.    I love your fresh ingredients.  And that you stood the test of time and didn't get all crazy with gourmet burgers or bloated menus.  You didn't decide to truck in your burgers frozen from the burger factory.  You stuck to what works; you didn''t mess with a good thing.  And you managed to keep it fresh without raising the price.    I also love that your fries aren't that great.  I do love that a teenager cuts the potato right there in the store, but unfortunately they're not to my taste.  That  doesn't stop me from eating your fries, of course. But eating less of them means i can have a second burger.  I especially love that."}
{"text":"I don't know how people in Vegas can call this nasty shit \"food\". Seriously, are all of your taste buds dead and everything tastes like cardboard?   Wish I could give a negative rating, because not only is there bad food, but they put religious tracts on their cups. (At least they did last time I was there.)   Disgusting. Save your money and go to Fatburger or Grind."}
{"text":"It never seizes to amaze me how crowded INO can be; and how many pppl are so willing to wait for INO, of course, I'm one of thoes ppl who are willing to wait.   This INO has a fairly big dining in space. Although it was crowded the night we went, we were able to find 2 tables by the time we were done ordering. The staff was very efficient; the ordering line went by pretty quickly, and within 10-15 minutes, we got our order. And for an INO in a busy area with tourists, I'd say that's pretty good!"}
{"text":"My first In-N-Out experience! I've been waiting a long time for this - and I'm glad I finally made it!  Had the #2 (cheeseburger and fries) and it was great! Not my favorite burger - that will remain Backdoor Burger - but In-N-Out is very good. As everyone says, if you are in an area where you can partake, do. If I go back ill def try the animal style.   The drive through line was LONG! We went inside and the wait was very short - seems like the best option is to go inside and order to go."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this location a 4 star is because the wait time for the drive thru and dining in. Yes it is off the freeway, on a major street, and in a busy shopping center but the wait time is always so long. However you can never go wrong with in n out."}
{"text":"I like coming to this particular location because there traffic is not as bad as the other locations. They are quick and efficient. You can never go wrong with in n out."}
{"text":"Only reason why I gave this location 4 star is because of the long wait time for drive thru and dine in. I know it's off of the freeway and on a major intersection but the lines are always so long. Aside from that, you can never go wrong with in n out."}
{"text":"I love the service here, they're on it! Walking into the restaurant you feel a sense of stratospheric nostalgia. From the decor to the crisp white uniforms with the wedge cap.. I definitely feel like a valued customer. The menu is very simple. They have a single or double hamburger, fries, soft drinks, and milkshakes. That's it. Don't look for variations of burgers or chicken sandwiches, this exactly what it's called...In and Out Burger! To be truthful, I don't care for the fries, I think they're lacking flavor. Not to mention the last two times I ordered take out, mine were cold. I don't live more than a couple miles away. To be fair, try dining in first. The burgers have a special sauce that is the icing on the cake,  it's not too sweet, but it offsets the raw onions perfectly. To satisfy your late night cravings, they're open until 1:30 am."}
{"text":"After a disappointing visit to Habit Burger, which is an overpriced fake In-n-Out, I was happy to come back home to the real thing. I swear to never stray again. I don't care if my fingers smell of onions for the rest of the day, even after washing them over and over... Lol that just reminds me of how bomb my burger was. :) happy customer!"}
{"text":"This In n Out is probably the same as any In n Out you've ever been to. The service was swift and the staff were nice and the venue was clean.  I was also hungover to the gills, so I'm pretty sure this burger saved my life! It's right by the Nevada University though so it's often really really busy."}
{"text":"As always, super delicious. I ordered a Double Double with Animal Style fries. Just great food and great price. I love walking in and smelling the grease. And the service is just awesome...much better than most fast food places.   If you're ever located in the west and you have not tried In N Out, then I have no words for you. If you're coming in from a different area (foreigners included), you must try In N Out. If you don't, then leave the state now (just kidding but, but not really).   Overall, solid food for a solid price. One of the best places that I've ever eaten at. If I didn't care about my health, I'd eat here like 6 times a day."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of IN N OUT, the service is always top notch and the co stars are so young with great work ethic! This evening after a long day at work i wanted to treat my kids to something they love... IN N OUT, the drive thru line was snowed in.... The line inside was out the door but moving quickly.   My cashier was LUKE, he was fantastic and his great attitude was contagious, I work in hospitality and I would hire him in a heartbeat, wow, he had such a great attitude and very sweet, smiled the entire time and worked well under pressure.   I like to recognize when people work hard and enjoy what they do.   Way to go LUKE you were great, I hope you are here every time we come to this location."}
{"text":"Arrived 5pm. First in line, 15 minutes for food. Hamburgers meat dry, fries boring. Will not return. Yea Jack N Box."}
{"text":"Great place wish they had these in new York this is not a chain there only in four states and are ALL owned by the same family since 1948. Ten times better than any fast food burger joint and extremly friendly."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is a truly spiritual experience with a burger. When I bite into my Dub-Dub Animal Style I seem to transcend to a higher level of thinking and realization, but then 10 min. after I'm done, I simply go into a foodcoma and pass out. There are virtually no flaws in the In-N-Out world. I do admit that this place gets overly busy during primetime, but that's just foreplay, baby! You get the delicious aroma that makes the hairs on your neck stand up and tingles your whole body. You get to the window and see the staff members making the food, its like a porno! I'm telling you!  The staff is always soooo nice and they will do whatever you want...and I mean whatever...When you get this burger, it's all over, complete foodgasm. This place is so great for a late night binge, I am actually going as soon as SNL is over....can't wait, so excited!!"}
{"text":"Just as good as any of the locations in their home market, with a much cleaner lobby and friendlier employees.   On a busy Memorial Day afternoon I was \"In N Out\" of the drive thru faster than I ever had been at any of the locations I used to frequent in So Cal."}
{"text":"Service is fast and great no matter what In n Out I go to. The only thing would be that it's usually ALWAYS busy so most seats are already occupied. Yes, there are additional seats outside but when it's cold and windy like it is now, no one really wants to sit there. All in all, great food for cheap!"}
{"text":"Get your timing right and you can get in and out quickly... Time it wrong like during the lunch rush and you might have to wait a little bit. Either way, it is totally worth it! Very simple menu, and a secret one as well. Don't be shy if you have never had it and like a good burger."}
{"text":"Same decor and food, but this location must have just been understaffed.  Our food took at least 25 minutes. It was just unacceptable. From the outside the location looks huge and as big as the ones out here in the SF Bay Area, but watching the employees inside, they seem to move at 1/2 the speed.   In general the food was good and the same as usual. Customer service was friendly and nice.   In-N-Out is still my favorite fast food, but this location didn't deliver promptly. They were overwhelmed and unprepared.   The line was wrapping around the whole restaurant and the drive thru was equally long if not longer. At least my order was correct and I could get out of there finally after being there for around 30 minutes and that doesn't even include eating. We took our food back to the hotel!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try an In-N-Out burger and I wasn't disappointed. I ordered the double double with a side of animal style fries! Burger was good, nothing out of the ordinary, just a great fast food burger. The fries could have been a little crispier, but now I know you can order them well done or fries light well (which are crispier but not over cooked). All in all, I would get In-N-Out again!"}
{"text":"First time to this location. Ordered two double doubles with everything doubled including the onions & lettuce. Protein style. It was juicy in all the right spots & thevwait staff spot on."}
{"text":"Disappointed in this In-N-Out Burger location...went though the drive-thru to get lunch. Order was correct and service was friendly. However, I got really sick after eating the food. I'm hesitant to go back to this location due to how sick I got."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with T. Both got burgers but I got one with only pickles and cheese. He got it with every thing. While earing we found a French fry that escaped the fryer. Over all it was Good. Though we waited a while in line."}
{"text":"Best burgers ever. The burgers are very fresh and I always ask to out it in a box with a lid to go, it seals up the moisture and makes the fries soggy which I love.  If u want to go light, u can always ask to make it protein style so they substitute the bun for lettuce leaves."}
{"text":"Just so you know right away, this is the BUSIEST In N Out location in Las Vegas. I think the most i took once was like 30 min, but when it's not busy, it's pretty quick, about 5-7 min or so. Since it is a busy location, the dining room is slightly bigger. And you'll probably see a lot of people from all over the world, since i've over heard many of them say they go straight here after the airport or that its on their to do list to come here.  My personal favorite is to just get a cheeseburger with no onions, light spread, one order of fries, all in a box with a lid. Reason being is that it seals up the moisture and makes the fries soft, that's just my personal preference, because down side is that the fries do get hard very quickly but its cuz they are made fresh.  But if you don't mind onions, i  would definately try it Animal Style. Its basically extra spread and grilled onions. You can made your fries animal style too. Or if u wanna go healthy, ask for protein style, which the burger is wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun."}
{"text":"This is my absoulute favorite burger in the world! No other place can compare, not even a sit down restaurant. I already have a review at another In n Out, but again i will say that the best is when you take it to go. I say that because i highly recommend to ask for it to go in a box with a lid because it will trap the moisture in the box and the fries will become soft, that's how i personally like it because unfortunately the fries do become hard quick if you don't do this process.  This is the busiest location in Las Vegas. Since of course it right next to strip accross the strip. The longest i ever waited was 45 min to get my food after placing my order, but of course the line wrapped around all the tables in the restaurant. You'll run into tourists all the time that literally will get off the plane and drive straight here before even going to their hotel. And you'll always see taxis also with tourists. It's definately an adventure. The didning room is also slightly bigger due to how busy it gets.  Go try it!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, efficient and fast. Restaurant looked clean from what I could see. Our order was right and the food was good. Of course I recommend this location. Enjoy"}
{"text":"The Best In-Out Burger in Las Vegas. Great service and the fastest drive thru window! Oh did I mention the fries:) to die for!"}
{"text":"This is my local In-N-Out and I gotta give them a good rating because it's the first place I ate in Arizona after I moved out, they are very patient with me, and they never mess up my order.  \"What could they possibly mess up, Faraaz? They have like 4 things on the menu...\"  Let me use this time to show off my [confusing] order at In-N-Out:  Double-double + Animal Style fries + drink (which is a mostly iced tea, partially lemonade Arnold Palmer)  Customization: grilled onions & raw onions WHOLE, add pickles, add chili peppers, extra lettuce, extra tomatoes, prepare burger Animal Style, extra secret spread on the side. Also, empty a packet of pepper on top of the ketchup before dipping the fries in.  All that ^^^ plus whatever my lovely lady would like. And they never mess it up. Good on you, In-N-Out Tempe, you're doing California proud."}
{"text":"Ok. My dad and I were passing through NV to get back home from CA. We stopped at In-n-out burger, granted this was my first time here. Let me tell you..AMAZING. I know understand the fascination and deliciousness of the food here. Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I know it's busy and all but my double double had burnt things in my burger. Really gross In and Out. Typically all in and out is super clean. Apparently this one is the exception."}
{"text":"Always yummy food. The customer service is outstanding.  It's a treat for us because we don't have an In N Out Burger anywhere near us."}
{"text":"I sure was satisfied after I ate here.  Service: Nice!  Atmosphere: Fits in perfectly!  Food: Excellent!  The menu is also very short and straightforward, love it.  I would recommend this place to anyone.  Expect me back after a while!"}
{"text":"In and out is so good and have always treated me well, great customer service. In n out is the best place on town to eat a tasty burger! Yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"I have had burgers on the west and east coast, and love the burgers here. The meat is fresh, they use real potatoes for their fries, the shakes are bomb, and the prices are not bad. I have eaten at many locations and have never had a bad experience. The only complaints I  typically have are the long lines. However, you usually aren't waiting long, and they move people rather fast. I love the fact that they offer all their burgers protein style (wrapped in lettuce/ without the bun). They grill the onions and they offer animal style fries!! ( Their special sauce which I think is like a thousand island dressing, grilled onions, and cheese).They cook your food to order, and it is always hot and fresh.  If you haven't tried it, definitely try them. But preferably off the Vegas strip and in maybe even in Socal. ;-)"}
{"text":"It never fails that I get a craving for a good burger right in the middle of peak meal times for this place.  Thankfully the burger was worth the wait.  I went through the drive thru and they had a person walking to cars to help speed up the line.  I ordered and quickly moved through the line.  I had a double, double protein style.  I love a good burger but hate the feeling of eating a giant bun as it subtracts from the flavor.  I devoured my meal and went about my day.  I hope to get better at planning my trip for food in hopes of not waiting in a huge line!"}
{"text":"As far as fast food burgers go, In-N-Out is up there at the top and this location did not disappoint! My coworker and I went here for a quick dinner while traveling for work. This place was fast, efficient and brought the piping hot delicious burger and fries! Animal style burgers and animal styles fries are the way to go!!"}
{"text":"Double-Double animal style and fries animal style.  Hands down the best burger. Runs circles around 5 Guys and Shake shack."}
{"text":"OVERALL: OK for a quick bite? Sure.  Slightly better than a normal fast food place? Sure.  Perhaps 3.5 stars if I'm rating it as \"Fast Food.\"  Overall though, even if there were I&O's near me (Central Connecticut), I can't imagine I'd eat there often.  I'd equate it to Skooters in Windsor Locks, and can quickly rattle off numerous other burger places I'd rather go (some pseudo fast-food like White Hut, Shady Glen, and Five-Guys, some real restaurants like Catsup & Mustard, Ted's Montana Grill, Bobby Flay's Mohegan, Red Robin).   FOOD: I don't get it. A lot of hype, if you ask me.  The burgers were better than normal fast food, sure, but they weren't really that great.  The texture is nice and pleasing, and it  tasted a bit more like beef than McD's/BK, but that's not saying much.    And the fries...blech.  Flavorless shoestring.  I have a nearly offensive level of appreciation for ketchup, and the fries made me ALMOST say \"screw it\".  The fries at Five Guys are much much better.   SERVICE: Ordering was quick, but the wait after wasn't.  We had to wait absurdly long because their printer stopped working, and the guy I assumed was the manager didn't notice since he was busy flirting with a customer, (While the place was packed...flirt on your own time, not mine. Thanks.).    Cleanliness was pretty damn good for a fast food place, particularly considering how crazy busy it was...I have to give them that.   ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: It peeved me that for our takeout they just threw ketchup packets on top of uncovered fries.  Thanks for reaching your dirty mitts into the ketchup packet bin, and dropping it all right on my food. Sure I'm going to be touching those potentially dirty packets with my fingers, and then eating with the same hands...but I don't need I&O skipping that step.   Next time I'm on that side of the country it'll be Fat Burger time. A little birdie tells me that place is better than In and Out."}
{"text":"This is the best burger place ever! Their menu is very simple and that's what I love about it. The quality of their food is superb. I always get a Double-Double burger with fries or cheese fries. They are both very delicious. Their milkshakes are thick and creamy. The employees are nice and they move quick. It will take a little long if the place is crowded but the wait is definitely worth it!!"}
{"text":"Love.   I try to make it a priority if i can to stop at In-N-Out Burger if i see one because there are none in my local area. The Vegas location lives up to the reputation its west coast family started.   If you've never experienced this growing chain, give it the time of day. It's a simple order, fast food, fresh ingredient burger chain that will change the way you look at the fast food burger.   Price point is reasonable."}
{"text":"Ah yes, an East Coaster's review of the ubiquitous In-N-Out. I ordered a cheeseburger animal style, with fries and a chocolate shake. The flavor the of entire cheeseburger was delicious, however, I was thrown by how small the patty is. I felt I had little idea how the meat actually tasted since it was thin. The animal style cheeseburger is definitely better in flavor than some of my favorite local joints, but for me, it will never top my beloved Smokeshake burger from Shake Shack.   The fries were great and I appreciate that they don't put the salt on them but give it to you on the side. I don't like food that is too salty so giving the option is a leg up. The chocolate shake was good too, but it's not the best simple chocolate shake I've had.   It is also nice that the kitchen area is so open, so that you can really see the human conveyor belt slabbing together the fresh lettuce and onions and whatnot on the burger. Ordering is simple, the menu is super small and 'animal style' is't included on it. I've also heard they have a protein option which if you ask for gives you the burger without the buns. So West Coast, you have a great joint here, now please don't write off my East Coast beloved's before you try them XD"}
{"text":"What more can you say about this place. The food is always delicious. Any time I get the chance to visit an In-N-Out, I never hesitate.  Only reason why this place did not get a 5* was because of the wait time.  I know they're busy almost 100% of the time but for some reason this location is really slow compared to the others that I've been.  about a 15 minute wait when there was only 3 cars in front of us. Food quality and taste was the same and the cashiers were friendly!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times when I get that craving for a juicy burger! I went at around 4:30 on a Thursday and to my surprise, NO LINE! I'm so impatient so that was a major plus!  In-N-Out is a big thing back home in Orange County, so it makes this place that much better for me. I always the get the same, Cheeseburger - Animal Style - No Tomato - Extra Pickle :)   As for the freshness, it's always been on point every time I make a visit. But then again, who can complain about In-N-Out?! I love how fast this place gets you in and out!"}
{"text":"There is so much hype and rivalry with Shake Shack, Whataburger.....  It wasn't too busy when I went. The line to order was short, but the line to wait for food was all huddling around the drink area. Luckily for me, I only ordered a chocolate shake and animal style fries. Prices are pretty cheap until you want to make it animal style.  Chocolate Shake - $2.50 It was too thick to even drink out of the straw.   French Fries - $2.10 + $2.00 (Animal Style) - I guess I'm just not that big of a fan of In -n-Out like others. It was okay.   I think I prefer Shake Shack over this place. I guess I come hoping it'll be better then the last time."}
{"text":"I've been here before and probably would have given them 3 stars, but this time when we went it was just meh. No one in the group seemed to enjoy their meal. Besides the cheap price, the patties were thin and just didn't have much taste. Fries were skinny, but not much flavor. I got mine animal style, but they didn't make my fries animal style. Oh well....  Think I'm over the hype of this place. Hopefully, if I do return, it'll be better."}
{"text":"Last time we went to In-N-Out....the experience wasn't good. Wanted a quick bite after our night out and wanted my guy to check it out.  Guy was nice and the food was fresh and good."}
{"text":"Not really sure what all the hype is surrounding this place.  The burgers are just a stack of lettuce, and the fries are dry, overcooked and hard."}
{"text":"This is my favorite In-N-Out location. We visit at least a couple of times every time we're in Scottsdale. I love the simple menu, the prices are great, the quality is always good, and the service is second to none. Even when the drive-thru line is long, they manage to move people along nicely. We've never had an order messed up here, and the staff are just so polite. Love my animal style hamburger. :)"}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out Burger, and I typically jump at the chance to go when the opportunity arises (I live in Canada), but I have to say that it's not worth going to this Strip location if you aren't good with crowds. It was insanely crowded with a crazy long line. No hope of getting a seat indoors or outside. They also messed up my order, so we had to stand around even longer. I was desperate to get out of there. We ended up awkwardly eating our food in the blazing sun by the fountain outside. The staff (as per usual In-N-Out fashion) were attentive and polite, but that was the first time I've ever had an order messed up at any In-N-Out location (we usually do the drive-thru). If I'm desperate for In-N-Out next time I'm in Vegas, I may take an Uber to a different location."}
{"text":"Friendly and clean so How can you ever go wrong? My favorite is the protein style without the meat and a side of animal style fries. I know, you are thinking, did she just say withOUT the meat??? YUP, I did! I don't eat meat and this is how I can enjoy In-N-Out just the way everyone else does :-) So I just have them fill it up with the veggies and it is super yummy every time, just the way I like it! The best part about it is, that when I order it, they don't even bat an eye at me, they just pop in my order and ask me what else I would like! I love it there, YAY for In-N-Out!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fast food girl...  But how can you not get a west coast fix while in town!?!  Always packed .. But the indoor (air conditioned -Very important) seating is never enough for the volume of customers serviced.  Burger was good.. Forgot the grilled onions .. Darn it.  While it was memorable, couldn't finish the whole thing...  Eat the fries while they're hot!"}
{"text":"They don't have an In-N-Out where I live, so while on a trip to Vegas, I thought I'd try it out. It's a pretty decent burger. The fries seemed like they sat around for about 10 minutes and were not very hot. They also seemed dried out and not salted. Kind of hard to believe that they would be served that way, since the place was absolutely busy.   I will definitely stop by again if I get the chance."}
{"text":"I must say this is one of the worst in n out we ever been to! There are four of us and we all agree to this. For some reason the double double tasted really off from the standard California in and out. We believe this could be dry the patties on the burger. The fries tasted OK."}
{"text":"Best fast food burger out there.   Double-double animal style. Crunchiest lettuce one has ever crunched, ripe tomato, 2 x juicy beef patty cooked in mustard, 2 x american cheese, thousand island, and grilled onions. This beast was to die for. Really though, heart attack is imminent but so worth every morsel. Each burger patty is made to order. Also, according to their website they do not own a freezer, microwave, or heat lamp. And their burger patties have no filler or preservatives of any kind. Pretty cool. And in this case, a little goes a long way. You can taste the quality difference in their product compared to any other fast food restaurant.  1 is enough to fill you up. Trust me. I ate two and needed a prescription for stretchy pants and no motion what-so-ever for several hours after consumption. Eating 2 does NOT come recommended."}
{"text":"Coming from a state that doesn't have in and out, but as gone to multiple locations in CA, NV and AZ the food is amazing! But it's seems like they can't figure a good system to get walk-in/to-go orders especially at this location we waited almost 25 mins while they gave out 15 order numbers after ours was supposed to be called. After seeing someone else get their animal fries which is all we order get theirs, I figured we should have gotten ours. Ended having to go up to the counter,... love the food but was kinda disappointed in the service at this location."}
{"text":"There was a truckload of hype by all the In-N-Out disciples that this was the Mecca of hamburgers. I pried myself away from strippers, gambling and general debauchery to devour some of this fabled food and though not blown away, it made my tummy happy.  I ordered a Double Double Animal style along with Animal style fries and a chocolate shake to wash it all down. I had been drinking all the free booze while gambling and needed something greasy and heavy to calm my stomach and line it for...well, more drinking.  The burger was good, hot, a little messy...which is a good thing in my book. The thousand island dressing didn't drown out the fried onion flavor on the burger or fries and the tomato and burger still had some room to show off their flavor too. It wasn't a let down, it was quite good. Better than Five Guys? No way.  This joint is right off the 15 so don't expect to walk there if you're staying at a hotel on the strip. Grab a cab and head out. The employees at this In-N-Out were attentive, efficient and very polite. They were slammed right after I got my food and they kept the line moving."}
{"text":"In and out burgers are solid..   Great quality beef  Really good buns   This location is new and very clean"}
{"text":"Ok this one is a tough one. When I moved here. I missed California and all it's eclectic foods and diversity. But In and Out is a staple there. So when I saw it here. It was very homey.  I missed having my protein style and and animal style burgers. double doubles, 3x3, and 4x4. One thing about fries or for you Belguim homies/French Homies Pomme Frites. First of all you gotta get all the moisture out when you're cooking fresh fries from Idaho potatoes. So you gotta cook it twice so it's crispy. No one likes a limp fry. Most women like it crispy and golden and soft and gushy in the middle when you take a bite steam rushes out in ooey goodness when dipped in ketchup. Yea...that was hot.... So this is what makes this place cool. Old Fashioned drive in 50's feel. Feels homey like california. Burgers with secret styles. Simple Menus. Yummy Thick shakes!  Bad things..FRIES...Eat em animal style to simulate a fully loaded baked potato. But be prepared to clog your arteries. Mmmm Mayo..."}
{"text":"All I can say is it's In N Out. You have to stop by when you're not from the area, and you see one. My stomach is always a fan"}
{"text":"Best burger in America? I don't know, but this is the first place all my family wants to go when they come in from the north east. I guess they don't have in and outs there? It's a really good cheeseburger and the special sauce goes good on their French fried potatoes too"}
{"text":"Double Double animal style with Fries well done... That is all I need. And they're open until 1am weeknights and 1:30 on Friday and Saturday."}
{"text":"Delicious burger & fries! Clean restroom. Plenty of parking. Easy on-off of Hwy."}
{"text":"Easy-to-find location off Blue Diamond Road. Delicious burgers & fries. Clean restrooms. Couldn't ask for better."}
{"text":"First time trying in n out today. I was surprised how simple and plain the menu was. Burgers, fries and shakes; that's it. I liked how simple it was. We tried #2 (cheese burger fries and drink). This place is very clean I was so impressed. The kitchen is clean and you can watch what they're doing, the tables and floors and ketchup/mustard/ drink area was clean. The staff were friendly and they kept maintaining the eating area. Again, I was so impressed. Our food was awesome. Fried weren't greasy or too salty, burgers were great, they put the perfect amount amount of lettuce and tomato on it. Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I moved here from California and apparently the service here is  just as good! I looooove in n out. I never eat fast food, except in n out, and I don't even consider it that because it's always freshly made. I always get a number 2 with animal fries. The staff is always so friendly and accommodating, and the food is always hot & fresh! Best burger you'll ever have! :)"}
{"text":"The burgers here are so good! They dont have an in and out where I live, so I really look forward to an opportunity to taste these seemingly homemade treats!"}
{"text":"What can you say? It's the best burger in the world.  The staff there was great, very friendly and willing to help."}
{"text":"Now - I am a firm believer that Shake Shack has taken the title as best fast food burger in existence.  That being said, In-N-Out is right up there with them, neck and neck.  I rented a car from the Luxor and was driving down to the Hoover Dam.  We were hungry, and craving In-N-Out so we pulled off the highway and stopped here.  It was packed as always.  I got my usual, Double-Double w/o onion, and well done fries.  My mother ordered a hamburger protein style.    The well fries always make the order take a few minutes longer than usual, but in about 15 minutes or so, we were on our way.  Fries were perfectly cooked, burgers tasted awesome as usual.  And the service was super charming and friendly.  Let me shout out my cashier by name, Edwin, because he did a fine job.  He's a very nice young man who clearly appreciates his job.  Great work making a customer feel valued!  Pet Peeve: as always, I hate religion being jammed down my throat, but when they do it with two patties, cheese, and dressing; along with well-done fries, I let it slide, and keep the 5* rating!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try In-N-Out! I live on the East Coast, so I've only ever heard about In-N-Out Burger. I was not disappointed! The lines were long but we were served quickly enough. The food was delicious! The burgers were super juicy and delicious and the fries were crispy on the outside, soft and potato-ey on the inside. Plus, everything was so inexpensive! Less than $8 per person for a burger, fries, and a drink! I am now a believer. I will go to In-N-Out every time I'm in the West from now on."}
{"text":"Quality every time.  Excellent every time.  Hands down dollar for dollar king of the burgers- and no fancy business going on either.  Just a straight up burger- the 3x3 with cheese hits it!  The quintessential old-school go-to burger.  Love a company that cares enough to put scripture on their containers."}
{"text":"This store is located near the strip. We stopped in the other night shortly before closing time.  We ordered two double doubles with fries and drinks. Even though they were getting ready to close, everybody was friendly, service was fast and the food was delicious and plentiful."}
{"text":"This In-N-Out is always busy and always on point! I live less than a mile away and every time we order from here, we are always pleased!  Great value, quality food, simple menu, and friendly service!!!  Why go to Burger King across the street when it's less expensive here and sooo much better?  One time I got a 3x0 (3 patties no cheese) which was a giant stack of burgerly goodness. Love the peppers and once and a while will get the fries 'animal style'.   YUM"}
{"text":"This In and Out Burger is honestly really good. It is better than the one in Scottsdale to me. My burger is never dry and always taste fresh. I do not like the way they make their Neapolitan Shake here (Scottsdale wins here) The ingredients taste fresh and crisp--Burgers are always right. This in and out does not let me down. Has a line 80% of the time but moves fast. Employees are usually out taking orders to make this happy. Never came across a rude one. You wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"It was good, definitely worth the try.  Had it twice in three days.  But it was not as good as the hype."}
{"text":"Wow! Great hamburger for the price!  They do have a drive through, but there were a whole lot of cars in it at 5 p.m. On Saturday, plus walking in you get the real feel of how your hamburger is made.   First, the smell of the place was totally fantastic--it just smelled fresh. No stale fry smell here. There was only one person in line before us, but several people waiting for food. There's a nice bench to sit down and wait for a to-go order and watch all the action.  The cooks were super busy, but our order came out in a reasonable time. Not having read all the reviews to learn about the secret menu, I ordered off the menu. I'm still a little amazed at the price, but then the hamburger patty is pressed so thin that the cost of the meat must be low. Still, the bun was so fresh and the rest of the ingredients tasted great."}
{"text":"Made to order burgers that you can customize to your your preference. This location of In-N-out has always delivered fresh and awesome tasting food.  I got two double doubles with just cheese, extra spread, and extra grilled onions.   The bun was toasted perfectly as usual, plenty of caramelized grilled onions, a generous amount of extra spread as I requested, cheese everywhere, and perfectly cooked hamburger patties.   There was a line in the drive thru' as usual, but it is always worth it when it is for freshly made food.   Some of the best places to eat are the ones that have limited and specialized  menus. In-N-Out is a prime example of this concept, and I have enjoyed their food at this location for years."}
{"text":"Quick service but there is definitely not enough parking, or seating (inside and out!)"}
{"text":"Double Double! Love In N Out! The service is always great and the food is delicious for fast food. We live in Portland now and miss having In N Out. We make sure to stop in anytime we visit family."}
{"text":"I have had a positive experience at every In-N-Out that I've been to, and this one was no different! Ordering was easy, and service was prompt. The employees were very energetic, polite, and it was clear that they loved doing their job.   I ordered their cheeseburger with lettuce, onion, and tomato, and I was NOT disappointed! In-N-Out's burgers always taste super fresh and delicious. For being fast food, I have no idea how they do it!   My only disappointment is that they only have locations on the West coast. Being from the East, I can only dream about the day where I'll have In-N-Out again."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is notably one of the most famous burger joints on the West coast!   Burgers - They are well-known for a reason! In-N-Out burgers are freshly prepared with 100% pure beef patties that are cooked to order. The patties are well-seasoned and juicy. Toppings include tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, and onions. Their special sauce (mayo, mustard-like) is delicious and adds great flavor to the burger. The freshness and quality of their ingredients come across with every bite!  Animal-Style Fries - Another distinguisher of In-N-Out are their \"animal-style\" fries. Their fries include freshly-cut potatoes topped with their secret spread and grilled onions. Unfortunately I am not a huge fan of the fries. The spread and grilled onions end up leaving the fries pretty soggy and I personally prefer fries with a super crisp texture.  The employees here are friendly and the restaurant is well-kept and clean. With their fresh ingredients, In-N-Out is definitely one of my favorite burger joints. My only wish would be for them to migrate to the East coast!"}
{"text":"Got a double and fries.  Fries hand cut almost \"STRAW\" thickness.  Burger was good and had a \"secret\" sauce.  Great atmosphere and the wait was fairly short during lunch time."}
{"text":"Tip = they are always showcasing how they are the top of the line, thank you guys  +will be going back +they really clean at this place +the food is fast and fresh  +the CS are great, friendly and will make your stay/ viste worth it that much more to come to the WB.   that was some great food being delicious, so delicious , as it's fast because their that good; I got the number 1one. It was great, really hit the spot, thank you, for they put only so much salt on the frys for a bit of taste, never and not the taste of the frys as others would be the salt to taste good at all; so it's great and can be good taste in the best if the healthiest kinda of life style that we all would love to live.. ..lol, if only we got to choice from more then living life or having to survive. Ultimatum ultimately forces you too survive. The that place was so clean, like you can tell that they really do clean the store/food place, like all food places should, I bet you can go to that for sure and really any #inandout(if all I.A.O., has the same methodology of just getting it done in providing the greatest thing that they can do for being the best of they can be and letting only the choice.. ..as unlike other places, In and out really cares if you are happy if you eat their. For that is the way that I felt, as when I went their their was so many wanting to do I.A.O. and still, I.A.O. token the time to act to the degree of \"As, if I was the only 1one their, so thank you for being or standing when others don't even try as their to busy acting like they are trying"}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is great and well, I went through the drive way and well, what a drive way/through, as it is some long one, as it cool because their is a big long window that you can see what is going on; so, it's worth it, as their are little to none, places that will show you their whole, well, at least some of the area where the food is made.  As, if you like to that over the places that hide the food making area, well, maybe not hide just can you see as you can see from this INOB; maybe some and still, if you want a great meal that they whole family and even your date will like."}
{"text":"This location was surprisingly dank.  The food and service were on fleek.  Surprising, considering that it's right off the main tourist district in Lost Wages.  Yeah, I'd go back to this location if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I love In N Out! Simple, delicious, inexpensive & some of the best customer service out there. I love the people at this location but it gets extremely busy here & the parking lots size does not support the amount of customers they get on a regular basis. The only downfall here is the wait. Granted they will all have a long wait time but due to the parking lot I have waited multiple times out on the road just waiting to turn in to be in the actual line."}
{"text":"Always a long line, employees are always friendly and food is always great. This location is the closest one for me so I go to this one the most.   They never close on time since there is always a line swirling around the building but the employees maintain a good attitude and a smile which is indeed rare in this town. This drive thru is quicker than all the others ones to me and they always get my order right which is also rare among all other fast food restaurants here.   It's my fave in every way."}
{"text":"FINALLY...I am embarassed to say after 33yrs, this was my first encounter with In N Out.  Yes, I know...SHOCKING.  To my defense...I've actually been in one before, but was vegetarian at the time...so no go.  Let me say this...DEFINITELY worth the hype.  The only thing I dont love is: being a novice at In N Out...I didnt know all about the \"secret\" menus.  Luckily, I was with some folk that ordered the special sauce and grilled onions...which later, I found out is called \"animal style.\"  Holy HELL...animal me up!  (*sorry PETA).  I thought the burgs were fantastic.  The fries were just ok...but the burgs...oh my god.  Like seriously, OH MY GOD."}
{"text":"Finally ate here for the first time. Got the double double and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had. Now i can't stop going back!!!!!"}
{"text":"After a hike with my fiancé and best friend over at Red Rock, there was only one thing I wanted... To burst my In-N-Out Burger virginity!!  I've heard nothing but rave reviews about the famous In-N-Out burger. So my expectations were set high, but not TOO-TOO high because it is a fast food joint after all. The menu is short and to the point. Burgers, fries and shakes. What more could you want?   Once my ordered arrived I was anxious to dig in, but not without a Instagram-worthy photo-op to tell the world I dined at In-N-Out for the first time. My double double burger was fresh, juicy, and every bite of deliciousness. The fries are freshly made every day and topped with their secret sauce, I now know why it's such a hit.  Overall, I can't wait to come back to In-N-Out! This location was exceptionally quick and friendly towards a first timer, and I appreciate that."}
{"text":"Ok...so I'm not a fast food junkie....over my lifetime I've tried all the majors (McD, BK, Wendy's) and plenty of the Up & Comers (i.e. Smashburger, Habit) with my personal favorite being Shake Shack. I love burgers but prefer a good gastropub burger. All this being said, I finally had the chance to try the cult classic, the infamous In & Out (double double burger) with fries and it had to be one of the Biggest Foodie disappointments ever!!! What social media hype! What with all the blogs and secret menus!? I didn't realize that it was cheaper than Mickey D's, but now I know why. Cheap ingredients! I can only explain the great reviews by a following of a munchie crazed & hazed public at 2am....no diners out west like here in the east I guess... Finally, and again, this is just my opinion..... I thought In&Out meant that the service was fast. I really think it means as soon as you eat it (In), keep a bathroom close by (Out)....and the fries sucked too."}
{"text":"$3.75 for a PERFECT cheeseburger...what a steal compared to all those fancy LA burgers that you pay a whooping $15+ for. everytime people visit LA and have never been to in-n-out, we make sure we take them! and if we're going just to go, i guarantee half our conversation is about how amazing the burger is and HOW IN THE WORLD do they make such a perfect burger!!  i always get a cheeseburger animal style with well-done fries. try it, you wont regret it."}
{"text":"Food is always good and freshly prepared. This in and out is clean and the employees are always smiling and very polite."}
{"text":"Will always love this place! I am a vegetarian so I get the grilled cheese and let me tell you, it is amazing! The service is always great and I just love this place! :)"}
{"text":"This place gets really busy due to its more traditional pricing than other joints on The Strip. The food is exceptional and the service is prompt and pleasant. The atmosphere is nice as well! Not a huge lover of their fries, but the burgers were delish!"}
{"text":"I am still trying to figure out the hype of In-N-Out. The Animal Style Burger and fries were good but nothing special.  I think 5 guys is much better. Maybe I'm missing something but to me it was a little higher class than McDonalds."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Perfect fast food burgers at prices that are comparable to most MSG factories. Animal Style anything!"}
{"text":"There are no In-n-Out burger joints in the Midwest so everytime I am on the West Coast, I have to hit up this place. 3x3, 4x4, animal style, Omg!  Probably the busiest In-n-Out I have ever been too but well worth the wait.  I never seen so many employees working in a fast food restaraunt.  Impressive!  dp"}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix with a friend who'd never been to In-N-Out, so I told her I'd take her. The location was fine, service was great...I just have to say that I'm not that impressed with In-N-Out in general. Maybe it's sacrilegious to say so, but I think it's all just \"ok\"."}
{"text":"My husband's former employer said when we get to Phoenix we must go to In-N-Out. He said the last time he had one there was a line out the door. Not much of a beef burger person, we stumbled upon this burger joint as we left Ikea and decided to try it. The emergency granola bar I keep in my purse wasn't working.  There was no line out the door, who wants to wait in line anyway. We both ordered a cheeseburger (no tomato, no special sauce, no ketchup for me). It arrived in a card board container which was kinda cute and everything was hot and fresh. My burger has a thick slice of onion and several crispy lettuce leaves. The burger itself was just okay, but the freshness of the toppings won me over. My husband's had a big slice of tomato.   Did In-N-Out live up to the hype from his former employer? Not exactly, but it came pretty close."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing except for a bit of a long wait for my grilled cheese. ANIMAL STYLE EVERYTHING!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a double double with everything today on the way home from school and I sat in the drive thru for about 15 minutes. Not sure what was wrong, but you would think at 1:30 in the afternoon there wouldn't be that long of a wait, especially at a window. Not a huge deal, but something to keep in mind if you're in a hurry  ------(.5) star deduction---- subtotal = 4.5 stars   When I got the bag the fries were nice and crisp, I could tell they were very fresh, definitely worth the wait. In-n-out fries have always been a little thin tasting if that makes any sense and these seemed about right. I still think a fresh batch of McD's fries are better, but in general, the fries were very good.  ----No star deduction---- subtotal = 4.5 stars  The hamburger I got had lots of gooey cheese on it, just the right amount of ketchup, and the onion and tomato seemed very fresh. The bun was nice and fluffy and wasn't too heavy. Overall, though, the patties were pretty thin. I've always felt that the patties at in-n-out were on the thin side and today just confirmed it. I felt like I got the same amount of burger at five guys with a single patty. The burger was very good though. I thoroughly enjoyed it.   ----No star deduction----subtotal = 4.5 stars  I typically say that there's always room for improvement, but in this case, In-n-out has their formula down pat. The offer hamburgers, fries and shakes, and they do all three very well.I give them props for execution and consistency. However, I found their lack of options for toppings lacking, and for that, I have to deduct star power.  ----(.5) star deduction---- subtotal = 4 stars  With  five guys and smashburger in town, there's some serious competition in what I like to think of as the specialty fast food hamburger joints and If in-n-out expanded their topping selections I could see them becoming my favorite burger in town, however for now, that race goes to five guys, by a thin stack of jalapeños on my burger.  ----Overall star power---- 4 STARS"}
{"text":"Their burgers are great and super gluten free friendly.  Customer service is excellent!  Great value altogether."}
{"text":"The menu at In-N-Out Burger is as simple as it gets: you can order a hamburger, a cheeseburger or a double-double (double meat and cheese), which are served with or without fresh or grilled onions. Fries and soft drinks are also available, as are three varieties of shakes, but that's about it.  So what makes a visit to In-N-Out something many visitors to Vegas have to do? Aside from the fact they use natural, fresh ingredients, keep their restaurants very clean, and treat their employees very well, they've also created a mystique about themselves by limiting their stores to California, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada, and developing a cult-like following of carnivores in the process. While their burgers are superior to what you might find at the fast food outlets run by a shifty clown or creepy king, some describe their burgers and shakes as fast food bliss, and it's not uncommon for some guests to make it their first stop in Vegas from the airport while en route to their hotel.  Price is also a factor, as you can easily feed two for under $15, and for as little as $10 if you don't want to gorge yourself.  And then there's the whole \"secret menu\" thing. Walk up to the counter and ask for your burger \"animal style\" and receive extra pickles, extra spread (their secret sauce), grilled onions and mustard fried onto the patty. Or ask for a grilled cheese sandwich, or a protein-style burger (served without the bun), or opt for their 3x3s or 4x4s (three burgers and three slices of cheese, or four burgers and four slices of cheese). While a 44 is the maximum, some stores will allow their zealots to go a little crazy with orders for a 2020, and an infamous 100100 was once ordered right at thilocation here in Vegas.  Unfortunately, there's no In-N-Out Burger located strip side, so you will need a car to get to one. If you've rented a car, your best best is taking a quick, two-minute drive behind New York-New York on South Dean Martin Drive just off West Tropicana Avenue (route 593). Walking there is not advised. Don't do it.  If you don't have a car, taking a cab is always an option, but I would recommend heading to the location at 2900 West Sahara Avenue to avoid traffic and for getting the most bang for your buck. It's a $15 cab ride (each way) from the middle of the strip, but you can make the most of your trip by stopping into Palace Station, which is just down the street.   You can also save the cab fare and get to this In-N-Out location using public transportation. Just hop on the Strip and Downtown Express Bus heading north from one of its many strip-side stops, and transfer onto the 204 at Sahara and Santa Paula heading west. This trip will cost $5 (which will let you use the city's buses for two hours), or spring for the 24-hour pass that is a bargain at $7 and will give you enough time to explore downtown Vegas and the Fremont Street Experience, the World Market Center, and the Las Vegas Premium Outlets the next day, and meet a bunch of interesting characters on your travels. Just stay away from the shifty clowns."}
{"text":"Often imitated, never duplicated -- this fast food burger place continues to be the gold standard.  Double Double, protein style with fries animal style... vacation doesn't get better than this.  Friendly service and a beautiful day top it off."}
{"text":"Love the simplicity of the burger. Not overwhelming but you still get the taste of a great burger. Love that the menu is small and so easy to decide. Staff are friendly and upbeat, constant flow and wait isn't too long. Overall one of the best burger joints for simple but tasteful burger."}
{"text":"definitely comforting that this place is not too far from where i live now. back in LA we went to in n out ALL THE TIME!  anyway, service here is ok. it gets a little busy at times, but they are definitely pretty good about being friendly and as quick as they can.  after reading a friend's facebook post about that maxim article and the \"secret menu\" i had to try and order \"road kill\" fries...and they refused to make them. that was a total bummer. i thought it wasnt a vegas thing or something, but apparently the one near UNLV will make them.  since its so close to my place, im sure i'll be back. gotta love the animal style fries and neopolitan shake!!! and - major plus - i always order extra pickles with my burger and usually i'll get a few on my burger, but they really load it on!!!"}
{"text":"Really fresh and delicious. This was my first time here and it lives up to it's reputation of quality. All the workers were very happy, the food took a little longer than McDonald's, and the restaurant was very clean. A well run fast food joint."}
{"text":"Went to an In-N-Out after getting married in Vegas! Burgers are GR8 but I'm a lil disappointed they didn't have mayo, they have some kind of \"secret sauce\" mayo they put in mayo's place.... You can't sub out mayo! Fries & vanilla shake were awesome! I'd recommend this eating establishment!"}
{"text":"I am never disappointed with In-n-out's food. I absolutely love their burgers and their fries. I've always wanted to try the quadruple burger but I still have not been able too haha. I like their animal style fries and their milkshakes are just the bomb. You can never go wrong with In-n-out!"}
{"text":"If you're going to eat fast food, eat In-n-Out.  Family owned company, fresh cut frys, never frozen all beef patties and a super clean kitchen/dining area."}
{"text":"Yuck, yuck, yuck! Food at this location has been going downhill for some time. Last year we reduced our visits to this establishment. Burgers got tasteless and the fries are nothing special.  FYI, I lived in LA for 25 years, so I KNOW and hav worshipped In and Out.  But this location's food is such a disappointment. (Staff gets 5 stars). Last night was the corker, my hamburger tasted 'off'. Thought it was the grilled onions since I don't get them that often. Immediately after finishing my meal I got intense painful stomach cramps. A few minutes later I puked up everything. All gone and out of my system. What does that say when throwing up is a relief? Will never eat a burger from here again. Thank god Smash Burger opened up nearby."}
{"text":"First of all, let me state that this place was so packed when I get in there that most fast food places would have been eaten alive by the crowd.  Here, however, they calmly churn through the people and I still had my food within 10 minutes.  Being an In-N-Out virgin, I didn't know what to expect.  However, I got some tips from a friend's boyfriend about this whole \"secret menu\" business, and decided that mustard grilled was going to be the way to go.    It definitely was.  This may have been one of the all-time best fast food burgers I've ever had.  The fact that the burger comes deluxe automatically is a big plus for me.  Definitely a good decision on my part to go here while in Vegas, which I only did because of the fact they were mentioned briefly in \"The Big Lebowski.\""}
{"text":"My favorite place to stop by when I visit Vegas. Food is delicious and you cannot go wrong with it being super cheap."}
{"text":"We love in and out, there shakes are delicious! Their lines are always long  because of how good their burgers and fries are! This place is always hopping because of how good their food is!"}
{"text":"If I never had in n out before and this was my first time I would not be back.  I lived in California and ate this about twice a week. When I visit Cali the first thing I have to get is in n out.  This place did not satisfy my crave. The burgers did not taste like  the burgers that I crave. The fries didn't even taste fresh. Something is not right in this location.  I guess I will have to go to Cali to satisfy my in n out crave."}
{"text":"Best burgers around--and probably less expensive than McDonalds!!!  Not a huge fan of the fries, though."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite locations in all of Las Vegas, not only are they fast and super friendly for locals, but they are super super friendly to my pet pug!  this will always be my choice location"}
{"text":"First time i had this was in Dallas, TX and turns out it was one of the new places they were opening. It hurts that they don't exist on the east coast. After a night at the bar I decided to talk all the way to the place. Yes that how much i was craving it. I was singing the theme song all the way there just to keep myself motivated to keep walking. I always get the double cheese burger with the regular fries and coke."}
{"text":"I'm from the East so In and Out is a new burger experience for me. It was great tasting on a soft bun which I loved. Maybe the chain will come to Virginia some day."}
{"text":"Long line, the burgers and the animal french fries was worth the wait.  Lol simple menu with delicious food.  They need to build one in Washington state. Thanks."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong at in n out..   I grew up eating these burgers & fries )I'm from So Cal).. Anytime I'm watching my carbs I know I can swing into any location and pick up a double double protein style .. Fresh ingredients .. Done right ..  I didn't get fries today .. But I get them crispy or animal style .. Or both sometimes..   Quick place to grab lunch during the week.."}
{"text":"Burgers & fries done right.. keep it simple.. no need to complicate things .. I grew up in Cali so I know that I'm always going to get fresh & yummy food at In N Out..   If I'm low carbing then it's protein style (meat wrapped in lettuce, tomato, onion) double double .. skip the fries.. if I'm starving it's an animal style burger & fries .. some days the animal style fries are like comfort food..   Today I had a hamburger combo with fresh cut French fries & a Dr Pepper.. perfect lunch portion   I hear they have amazing shakes (dairy issues prevent me from enjoying those unfortunately) but you shouldn't go without ..   You can't go wrong at In N Out.. the long drive thru lines should tell you they have a following .. ask for a lap mat if you're eating in the car .. I love the lap mat .. keeps the secret sauce off my clothes"}
{"text":"I was told this was the place to get a burger.  I was told get it animal style and it's amazing.  I'm from Seattle so I had to compare it to Dick's Burgers seeing as there's the battle over who's better.  Once I realized Vegas had an In & Out it was on my to-do list.  I'm not even sure why people compare it to Dick's because it's not the same, other than they cut their own potatoes.  Two completely different flavors, and being a mossback (Seattle native) I have to go with the hometown's burgers on this one.  In & Out isn't bad, they just don't compare to Dick's."}
{"text":"The service is always amazing and the food is always great. I drive 40 out of the way just to come to this location. I don't eat meat so I ahwatukee ask for the vegan options and they are always more than helpful. I love this location."}
{"text":"Oh In n Out, what a guilty pleasure. Whenever we are on the west coast we make sure to stop at an in n out. The burgers are great, with the special sauce \"animal style\" it is a culinary treat. Also good is having the fries, animal style with grilled onions and cheese.  The only downside is this is off the strip with no means to walk there, requiring a cab ride."}
{"text":"Always yummy and FANTASTIC service!!! I had my hands full with my son and employees all offered to help me. Great milkshakes!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been fans of In and Out for as long as I can remember.  We can always count on consistently great food regardless of the location.  The employees are fantastic too but Ernie at the Avondale location stands out.  He is the most pleasant employee I have ever encountered ANYWHERE.  He sincerely enjoys his job and cares about his customers. What a great attitude and personality! This young man has a bright future."}
{"text":"Animal style burgers are the best.  I highly recommend it!  Go for the 3x3 or 4x4 if you are really hungry.  The service here is great and they have never gotten my order wrong.  This place is always super busy so it tends to get messy rather quickly.  The staff does the best they can to keep up though.  Definitely the best fast food place in terms of quality and service."}
{"text":"Love me some In-n-Out!!  I don't get around to having my In-N-out burger as often as I'd like, but when I do come, I like to make sure I can go at opening and to a location that isn't known for being packed.   I passed this location a few times while in the area before trying it. I finally came around opening and decided to stop by. Since I got here early, there were only two other couples ahead of me so I was able to order quickly. The guy at the register was super friendly with a high beat personality.   I ordered my usual the Double Double and made the fries Animal style and a medium drink. Even though I don't like tomatoes I always keep them as I give them to my girl as they are her favorite. Food came out quickly and was super fresh, hot, and looked amazing.   The inside was clean and everything was filled from the drink station to the ketchup.   Glad I came when I did as within minutes there was a line almost going out the front door. The employees were quick and were able to keep up with all the demand. Would definitely come back to this location."}
{"text":"Amazing food, nice staff, and good location.   Don't eat a lot of burgers, but when I do and I'm in the area, I always stop into In-N-Out. The burgers are amazing, the burger patty is just the right amount of meat and cooked to perfection. I always get the double-double and animal style fries. If you don't know what animal style is, it's pretty much melted cheese on your fries, topped with caramelized onions and their special sauce. A must try for any lover of fries.   This location has always been clean whenever I've been there. They come around constantly and pick up trays, clean off tables and sweep floors. The staff here are very friendly and make an effort to make some kind of conversation with their customers.   Will definitely be back to this locations!"}
{"text":"They are the best of the best when it comes to fast food. You just can't beat the quality, fresh ingredients. The staff was incredibly attentive to keeping things clean throughout, too."}
{"text":"A delightful break from \"casino food\". A fancy as the \"all you can eat\" meals can taste.. it was good to have a short trip to In & Out.   I try to come before the lunch crowd and \"In & Out\" in under 30 minutes. Burgers and Fries are fresh as ever -all you can drink, soft drink bar and I'm ready to get back to the Casinos!"}
{"text":"OK, I usually like to stop at local restaurants to enjoy their local approach to food, and there is an In-N-Out just a half mile from my home in California. But the rest of the people in the car wanted In-N-Out, and I wasn't driving.  But, the taste and quality was just like home. I got the cheeseburger, animal-style. (And if you don't know what that means, ask somebody who works there. Or eats there often.) And a shake. In-N-Out still makes the best burger anywhere, whether it is in Nevada, Arizona or California.  This location has a merchandise store next door where you can buy all kinds of In-N-Out T-shirts, hats, etc., etc.    Maybe next time I'll order a vanilla shake and a small drink, get some root beer and make my own root beer float. Mmmmm. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.  Animal-style fries, too."}
{"text":"I always enjoy a good In and Out burger.  What sets this place apart for me from other fast food is the quality of the ingredients - specifically the produce.  They always have nice fresh lettuce and tomato.  Also, it isn't a really greasy burger, which I always appreciate.  On this visit I had a cheeseburger protein style and it was quite good!"}
{"text":"Good quick burger. Get it protein style and lose the bub and they wrap in lettuce. I love raw and sauteed onions. Their fries are okay, not the best and not the worst, I find the animal fries gross but people love them. Ask for a few packets of fry sauce and dip them"}
{"text":"This is a simple but very Good Burger place. Hands down the best burgers. The fries are not good though. Very soggy. Avoid!"}
{"text":"Uhh YES. I've been here a milli times but today's lunch was really spectacular. Girlfriend working the dining area was on point with literally everything. She opened the door for me on my way in, brought my friends burger from the counter before she even realized her number was called, and even took care of our trays when we were done... and the food was obviously wonderful. Best guilty pleasure lunch spot EVER."}
{"text":"Just ordered food for staff of 15 and they were awesome!! The cashier Kaitlin took my order and got everything down and even triple checked my order. Then Alicia from back got my paper I had and offered to write each order separately (which anyone who order food for staff know this is awesome) saves so much time and hassle from people saying they didn't get something.   Food came out fast and everything was perfect!! Thanks guys for making this easy.   Food is always awesome here and they always make my life easy."}
{"text":"The smell gets me every time!! Just came for the shakes late night but the food is always good! They are always on top of it! Bomb food... Just a tip: not good if you take it home, must eat in the car right away or inside"}
{"text":"I have been going here since day one, the burgers are great and the french fries are just ok they need to use another cooking oil, there is no flavor. Also they need to sell pie's like what- a- burger my next best burger place . enjoy"}
{"text":"My non yelp daughter (who I still need to get on board with becoming an avid yelper) and I go here all the time. We really love their fries. The burgers are probably my favorite for fast food. The service is always really fast and the food is hot and fresh. I hear there are \"off menu\" items that I am just starting to learn about which is fun. Prices are great. Only complaint is the parking lot was very poorly designed. Going through the drive through is a nightmare at times. I will say though, I was impressed that one time when there was a really long line then had someone outsite taking additional orders to get them going faster. That is really great service especially in this AZ heat!"}
{"text":"Solid products just like the California stores.  Clean with the typically great customer service."}
{"text":"Just when I think that we have enough burger joints and we need to axe 'em all, I go back and visit In-N-Out Burger! They are still tough to beat. Their fresh, never frozen burgers still keep me coming back. While all the new burger places claim some gimmick or another, In-N-Out just has good friendly service, great burgers, good fries (not my favorite, but still pretty decent) and a simple menu. They always keep the place nice and clean. The crowds speak for themselves!"}
{"text":"When it comes to fast food cheeseburgers, In-N-Out is as good as it gets!  I've eaten at this particular one twice now while in Vegas and have never been disappointed.  The first time I wasn't familiar with \"animal style\" but this second visit I was in the know and loaded our burgers up!  Four of us shared 3 burgers and I don't think there was a crumb left after we were done.  As for the fries, those did not travel back to the hotel very well, but were still edible.  Just not crispy and pipping hot as they were the last time I ate at the restaurant.    So whenever traveling out West and you come across an In-N-Out, stop and eat.  You'll be so glad you did.  :)"}
{"text":"I've been to InO a million times and they've NEVER messed up my order.  Super good. I was gonna knock a star for cleanliness but as I opened this app, someone started cleaning."}
{"text":"Always my favorite burger! Cheese fries are bomb and you can mix milkshake flavors. Strawberry and vanilla mix is so good! This location has the best customer service and they never mess up the order! Lol"}
{"text":"This In-n-Out gets really busy but their food never disappoints. I've been here a few times, and I find myself here almost every time I go to Vegas. The burgers are great, the place is clean, and it is filling.  I always get the Grilled Cheese animal style with animal fries. Most In-n-Outs are only in California, but I am so grateful they opened a few up in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"I'm no longer an In-N-Out virgin! I waited all day in my only day in Vegas to make the trek walking from the Strip over to eat the burger I had heard so much about: double-double animal style. Was this likely the best decision before attempting to run my first ever half marathon? Likely not, but we'll look past this for now.  The trek, while a touch long, especially if you're trying to conserve your energy and legs for a run, is not impossible. There are a few tricks to the walk, including making sure you're walking along the same side of the street as the Excalibur and non New York, New York on your way across the freeway. When the sidewalk splits, make sure you take the right path, not the left, as this will lead to the bridge over the freeway.  Anyway, enough about walking there and on to the food. At 2 pm in the afternoon, the place was packed, but the cashiers moved through the line efficiently. Within 5 minutes, I was up at the front and placed my order for a double-double animal style with fries and a vanilla shake.   I then proceeded to wait about 10 minutes for my order to be made. The burger definitely didn't disappoint. Nice and juicy with good flavors. Best burger ever? Not even close, but for a fast food burger, it definitely ranks up near the top.  The fries, however, were disappointing. Little flavor. For a fast food fry, I have to give the edge to Five Guys on this one.  The shake was nice and thick and vanilla-y.  Overall, if you haven't ever been to an In-N-Out and are looking for a cheap Vegas meal option, it's worth the trip over the freeway."}
{"text":"Please, please, please In-N-Out Burger...PLEASE open a restaurant in the Chicago area!  How far would I drive for an In-N-Out Burger? To be honest, if time allowed, I would go as far as 100 miles, one way, for one of your delicious, fresh, hot, \"Double Doubles\"!  I'm crazy huh? Yeah, crazy for their FANTASTIC burgers!  And shakes too!  I know that locally sourcing their food products is the key to this chain's high quality standards and popularity.  Whenever I head out west, I make In-N-Out a DEFINITE stop. I've been to several of their locations in Arizona and California. This location in Peoria is one of my favorites!   I think the closest one to me here in the Chicago area would be in Texas. It's outside my \"100 mile limit\".  If money were no object, I would fly frequently to Los Angeles (LAX) and visit their location nearby. It's a great spot to watch planes land while enjoying one of the best burgers you'll ever eat from a fast food chain.  The staff is always friendly, the food is top-notch. They don't have a big menu, but that's okay. You come here for the burger, the fries, and the shake. Those are their specialties.   I only have TWO wishes for the corporate honchos at In-N-Out:  1. PLEASE open a location in Chicago 2. PLEASE stay open 24/7.  I sometimes CRAVE one of your burgers at 6:00am."}
{"text":"The burgers were nice and fresh and the fries were salty but not too salty and you can taste the potato. Overall it is a great place to sit down with some friends and eat a burger."}
{"text":"Okay In-N-Out, can you just stop being so perfect? I can't take it!  If it's not good enough that your burgers and fries are delicious, but you cater to us vegetarians too!? Come on!   As I sat there being a sad vegetarian eating my fries, my vegetarian friend comes with her animal style \"burger.\" I took a bite and of course it tasted like heaven...to my surprise..THERE WAS A NO MEAT!! It was buns and all the animal style stuff they put on it! And it still tasted incredibly delicious!   I love you, In-N- Out. That is all."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this In-N-Out burger since it opened 10 years ago and have never had a meal that wasn't excellent! The burgers are cooked to perfection, the fresh cut fries are not too soft and not too crispy with just the right amount of salt. The shakes are excellent as is the service! You get good value for what you pay. They are more expensive than McDonald's but more affordable than Five Guys or Smashburger. I brought my in-laws here yesterday and this was their first time eating at In-N-Out. They really liked it!"}
{"text":"I don't think I need to do any convincing to get you to go to In N Out...get a cheeseburger, get it animal style, get some animal style fries, get a shake and you're good to go."}
{"text":"It's In-N-Out, so yea, it's awesome. This is the location closest to The Strip so it can get very crowded at times. Make sure to order your burgers and fries \"animal style\", it's the only way to go. Gluten free? Order your burger \"protein style\" and it'll come out nicely wrapped in crisp iceberg lettuce. Save room for a shake."}
{"text":"Good food, generally need to ask for burger to be well done or it comes pink. Wish they had gluten-free buns then they would be perfect!"}
{"text":"I really do want to like In n Out more, but the food product produced by this organization wrecks my stomach. It gives me straight up liquid stool which is upsetting because it tastes so good. But this makes me suspect to their ingredients because even mcdonalds doesn't perform such horrid magic upon my soul. The meat is always cooked fresh and the banana peppers they leave out are always hot. There's definitely a standard to the overall business model, which makes them successful, but I do believe corners are being cut in their cheese and meat categories.   Maybe one day these burgers will agree simultaneously with my pallet and inards. Until then, I can't consciously make the decision to visit this place again. 3 stars"}
{"text":"Flavor Flav said it best: don't....don't, don't, don't believe the hype.  Ordering from the Super Secret Menu makes for a decent burger (whole grilled onion slice is key), but they never read that it's impossible to cook good fries by frying the potato once. Lame, limp, and tasteless. Even ordering well done fries just makes sure they're not cold when you're done with the burger.  At a place where they hype the freshness of the ingredients, the milkshakes are on tap from a machine.  If you're from California, chances are that you OMG TOTALLY LOVE THIS PLACE. Put an In and Out Burger in the Midwest and you'll see it die a quick death because they're just NOT that good.  The place is quite obviously a stripped down Steak 'n Shake since they opened 15 years later.  In a prefect world, Fatburger would control every In and Out location since they are superior in every way.  If you know what real food should be, then eating here will just make you doubt mankind's superiority as the dominant species on the planet.   If you, like the majority of Las Vegas, think that Taco Bell makes the best tacos, you'll love this place.   Mediocrity rules!"}
{"text":"The best fast food joint ever. I'm so sad that there isn't one in my hometown but whenever I'm in Vegas, I make sure to make a stop here! The service is always good. Fresh burgers, delicious fries and yummy shakes! Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Best fast food. I'm from the east coast originally and when I moved out west this place instantly became my favorite place to get fast food. I don't usually get fast food often but when I do it is at in-n-out. Animal style is amazing and if you want to be healthier you can get it protein style (lettuce instead of buns). If you are visiting from the east coast or mid-west you have to try in-n-out at least once! This location is great for me because its close to my house.   The service here was also good. There was a young man there who made sure we were enjoying our meal and took our garbage away when we were done. I thought this was really nice because I usually take the trash out myself and it was nice of him to do it for us."}
{"text":"Fast food done right. Three choices , keep it simple and do it the best. DOUBLE double , cheeseburger or hamburger cooked fresh to order. Hand cut fries , soda or a shake. 5 stars because they are awesome even though so simple. A favorite I have to have anytime I am on the  west coast."}
{"text":"Everything was good, but if IN N OUT knows how busy they're ALL the time, why did they choose the smallest location?!"}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place as there are none on the East Coast. Read up on the secret menu and had fun ordering. Went with a double animal style and cheese fries. The burger was very good! Added a bit more In and Out sauce (thousand island) and was quite happy with it. The fries were ok. Not bad but just ok. Next time I'd skip the  cheese and add plenty of salt and ketchup."}
{"text":"Even tho it's always super busy their customers service is always Awesome and the food is worth the wait they always try and get your food out as fast as they can and still give u awesome service :)"}
{"text":"Was on a business trip this past month in Arizona and was so happy I came across an In-n-Out!   Thought it was a only a Cali thing, but luckily I found one in Arizona!   My girlfriend recommended to get a double double animal style with fries animal style  and a vanilla milkshake. Omg. So freaking bomb. Everything taste so good! The hype is real!   Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"While this location isn't on Las Vegas Boulevard, it's the closest and the busiest.  With lines stretching out to the \"Strip\", this place is packed at all hours of the day!  Ok, it really doesn't extend out that far... but it sure does seem like it.  For a chain that arguably serves up one of the best, if not THE BEST, burgers in the nation... In-N-Out Burger has also become known for their non-\"fast\" food service.  That's ironic considering their menu options are the fewest of all quick service joints...single or double patty, with or w/o cheese, fries, shake and/or beverage.    You would think it be easy and quick right?!  Well, not exactly... not when you have a gazillion ways to serve up your burger and fries (Animal style, 2x4, 2xmeat, etc.).  Serving it fresh, made-to-order, and the way you like it is a great reason for their slug-paced movement.    Their double cheeseburger is one of the greatest things California has ever given to America.  Get it animal style, their most famous secret menu item, and you'll have pure awesomeness on a bun!  One other note, this location is also home to one of just two company stores.  The other one is in Baldwin Park, CA, where the restaurant was founded."}
{"text":"Awesome fast food joint!  Awesome food, awesome service, & very friendly people work here.  If you want good food fast at a reasonable price you've come to the right place.  This is also one of In-n-Out's best locations conveniently located at Loop 101 & Loop 202 across the 101 from the Chandler Fashion Center on Chandler Blvd. =)"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this classic! This location is on point! Food is always fresh and the service is super friendly!"}
{"text":"Never been disappointed here at this location. Always on point. :). Drive thru can get pretty long just like any other In n Out, so if you are in a rush make sure you give yourself plenty of time depending on what time you go."}
{"text":"In and out burger is probably the best burger for the money!  Burgers are my fourth favorite food considering I am  Italian and love pasta, pizza and meatballs!!"}
{"text":"Fast, consistently fresh and correct, and delicious (at least my taste buds think so)   It is fast food! Don't come here expecting a gourmet world-class burger or you will be disappointed. That's what happened to me the first time I tried it. I tried it again years later without the expectations, and was genuinely surprised at how much I liked it. For less than three dollars I can't imagine going to any other fast food establishment for a burger.  It as world-class gourmet as you're going to find in a fast food establishment LOL.   Also I like that they are privately owned that they pay their employees well. It makes me feel better about supporting them then some of the bigger  chains.  The way they treat their employees is evident in the service they deliver, the employees always seem happy and they work very efficiently because no matter how long the drive-through line is I am always in and out very quickly.   Try it for yourself.  You will either like it or you won't."}
{"text":"WOW!  I walked 2.5 miles in 100 degree heat to eat here!  FResh burger and fries not like other chains.  This was the best thing about my trip and I wish we had In n Out here in Florida.  The only drawback?  It's hard to walk to and busy."}
{"text":"I mean, how bad do I feel giving In N Out only 4 stars when it's always 5 stars in my heart?! This location is just always packed with 'vomit & blood on their shirts, still drunk from the night before' tourists. Which isn't really In N Out's fault...but is super unappetizing. Fries were undercooked when I ordered them \"lightly well\"."}
{"text":"Fast & friendly service, consistently delicious, always a favorite!  Parking is convenient and the single fries portion seems bigger than other In N Outs."}
{"text":"I used to think y'all West Coast folks were lying about this spot, but it's ALL TRUE! Hadn't had In-N-Out since I visited LA in 2008 and Omigosh...it's 1000000 better than I remembered! I literally went five times during Memorial Day weekend lol.  Burgers are A1. So good that I was willing to smuggle 50 of them on my flight...but TSA wasn't having it bahaha. ;)   I will say that I wasn't a big fan of the fries. Both the animal style and regular style tasted like NOTHING to me...like empty potatoes if that makes sense.   Additionally, this location is pricer than others in Vegas, but I guess it's all about location.   Yum yum yum for dem burgers thoooo. Yes lawd."}
{"text":"What's with the undercooked French fries , handcut is great , fresh potatoes  are wonderful but please finish the cooking process !   Another pet peeve is the burger wrapper that leaves me wearing half my lunch ! Deb K"}
{"text":"Poor east coast people! They'll never know the sheer greatness of In N Out! Probably the best burgers you can get on the west coast! It's so simple, yet soooo good! The menu is not complex, but you CAN get some special orders if you're not a newbie!   I always get the same thing and it never disappoints. I get the double double combo which includes a fries and a drink. If you're a true Cali local, you get half lemonade, half sprite. For some reason, it's the best drink to go with your burger and fries in my opinion! The milkshakes are actually not that great there mostly because I always feel like they're room temperature when you drink them, and they're so thick that you can't actually drink it through a straw. Then again that's just my opinion!   Here's some tips that you didn't know about 1) ask for grilled onions instead of normal onions. They're a lot better 2) ask for grilled peppercinis. If you like a little kick of spice, these are worth it. Not a lot of people know about this for some reason  3) animal style is awesome, but ask for more \"thousand island\" dressing once your Oder is done. What happens with my fries is that I always eat the top with all the melted cheese and stuff, then I end up just having regular fries"}
{"text":"The best burger place ever they have fast service and I love the animal style fries. The cheesy fries are great too  !! The kids love the milkshakes as well!!"}
{"text":"I guess I had my hopes up after reading so much about it but... didn't find it was anything special.  It's cheap so that's good but the burger tasted to me like so many other chain burgers I've had.  Maybe I hit it on an off day but... I didn't get the hype.  Location was clean and service was fast!"}
{"text":"I can't even consider in and out to be fast food, more like an awesome burger place that just so happens to have a drive thru and speedy turn out time. The staff is always friendly, I love that I can watch them make my food = no secrets or fallen patties ending up on my burger. My family visits in and out on average once a week and we have never had a rude employee, wrong order or any other occurrence that would be normal at any other fast food place."}
{"text":"Bottom Line Up Front:  Checked the block Tasted better than McDonald's  We were in need of serious 'comfort food' after Pittsburgh trounced the Jets, so we headed over to In-N-Out on Tropicana. The food -- small cheeseburgers, fries, vanilla shakes -- was average.The lightly salted fries were dry and lacked that savory, greasy (i.e., transfat) flavor I was craving after the NY Jets collapsed like an old beach chair after Labor Day. The menu is small, the restaurant was clean, and the staff is friendly, but In-N-Out doesn't really blow my dress so we'll press on in search of better burgers."}
{"text":"I guess I am not a burger person because I just don't get this place. Not many choices, the clerk wasn't too bright, and the fries tasted like those nasty frozen ones you'd get at a school cafeteria.  The burger itself was pretty good - was advised to get it animal and protein style. So, lots of sauces, lots of lettuce, no bun. It tasted fabulous, but was a holy hell mess. Needed a fork and knife, but not an option.   The line was very long. Service was fast, but maybe they were trying to go too fast because half our order was wrong.   Overall, not a place I would return, but my husband will make me."}
{"text":"My wife loves In & Out.  I've still yet to figure out what the hype is all about.  I've been to at least four different locations in four different states and the quality of the meal is the same.  So, you know exactly what to expect when you go to an In & Out.  I'm sure that's what attracts people to them but I need a lot more 'wow' factor when it comes to a good American burger and fries."}
{"text":"In-N-Out burgers are always the best fast food option. I am yet to stop at a franchise that did not meet my quality standards. This location does not disappoint. On my last visit, the counter seemed a little chaotic and orders were not coming out in order. Food tasted great, best option in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"Friendly service and one of the very best In-N-Outs I've ever been to!"}
{"text":"For me the best inn n out around!! Love this place... only downside.. its always packed!!!! Especially during lunch and dinner time..."}
{"text":"if i could live here i would. i love in n out. it's my go to. the staff and food is amazingggg. if you want to be happy, come here."}
{"text":"I just found out the cops were in the parking lot arresting a drug dealer the other day.  I would never expose my kids and family to what goes on in this restaurant again.  Then I read this article today, and it only confirms why we'll never visit this restaurant again.  Also, I found a human hair in the food, went to see the manager and the employees refused to give out her name....  What are they trying to hide?  http://www.opposingviews.com/i/society/man-sues-burger-chain-after-allegedly-finding-meth-his-drink"}
{"text":"Easily one of the most overrated burgers I've had in my life. I can't handle more than a slice of American 'cheese', so that seems to knock off a good portion of the menu (I'm looking at you, \"double double\"). Their beef is pretty darn good, but good luck savoring that, as it's overwhelmed by what is practically a salad between the buns. At least they're toasted to perfection.  Also, the fries blow. Yeah yeah, there's no trans fat! They're freshly cut potatoes! DGAF, it's not like anyone has health or freshness on the mind at a fast food joint. The novelty of the great ingredients wears off when you realize every item is the same. Ooh, animal style...who can actually finish off that monstrosity? Who would *want* to?  I stick with something simple. A nice hamburger with grilled onions. It leaves me content, but not anywhere near the foodgasm I hear California transplants raving about.  The pros: -Clean -Open lobby 'til 1AM -Quality ingredients  The bad: -15 minutes for one damned hamburger -No variety (unless you feel like adding more fat) -Fries are lackluster -Thousand Island or GTFO   They WOULD get two stars, but their business practices are too groovy for that. I *suppose* I can tolerate this place."}
{"text":"Time for my annual \"this chain is overrated\" rant. Finally tried animal style, and was underwhelmed. I mean, where's the thousand island? Totally negligible here,on the burger at least. Fries become a congealed mess. I should stick to my usual hamburger w/ grilled onions, which for the price is totes legit.   It was Monday at 10pm, but there was still a large crowd of mostly teenagers for who knows what reason. It took 20 minutes to get my order. Why did I drop by again?"}
{"text":"Conveniently located near my work location.  Food and service is consistently very good.  I like the option of grilled onions.  The menu hasn't changed and that's okay because they have perfected their recipes for what is offered.  They work as fast as they can, but that doesn't stop the long drive through lines that occur regularly at certain times of the day.  I've learned some of the patterns and know as long as I make it before a certain time of day [after work] I'm good.  Otherwise, the drive through starts getting longer and longer and...  Las Vegas needs more locations!"}
{"text":"Why am I writing a review for a chain? - Because this was my first In-N-Out experience and it was absolutely a hot mess.   We arrived at the same time as literally everyone else in the area and the line/ wait was so terrible- I was wavering on being hangry. I was so overwhelmed by how many people were in the restaurant that I hardly got to enjoy anything.  It was an actual battle (I'm not joking... I had to fight some arrogant baseball dad) for a table. People were actually standing next to us as we ate our food so they could claim our table next.  What I'm getting to is- if you don't have to eat in the restaurant, get this to go.  Food is mediocre and so not worth a super long wait. As we were visiting the area, I can't say that losing my business will make a difference, but my first In-N-Out experience will absolutely be my last."}
{"text":"FIX YOUR FRIES!  I've loved In-N-Out's burgers since I was a kid, and they're as good today as they were then. In my opinion, these are the best burgers in this price range.  But your fries suck. You guys brag about how fresh the ingredients are, but these are consistently the worst fries of any drivethru. They're dried out. Every single time. McD is better. BK is better. Cane's is better. Wendy's too.  Also, the shakes are like 50% foam. What's up with that?  In-N-Out...I love you. I'm a lifelong fan. But your fries are consistently lousy. Please be open to making improvements and change up those fries so my family doesn't have to make an extra stop at McD for fries every time.  Thanks"}
{"text":"The best fast food burger restaurant there is!! Staff is always friendly, always smiling, happy to help you in any way, the cleanest restaurant you'll enter!!! If you have never to been I highly recommend it, it will change your life!!"}
{"text":"I wanted animal style fries without the spread.  The cashier looked at me with judgmental eyes.  I am a grown ass man.  I order what I want.  That is all.  P.S. The fries were good!"}
{"text":"I'm honestly hit or miss on In-N-Out. I've had several good experiences and, more recently, some bad experiences at locations around San Diego and LA. That being said, for whatever reason, my experiences in Arizona have always been good. So I decided to try a new location (for me) near my hotel.   Like all locations I've been to, this one was clean and bright with friendly staff. It seemed to take a bit longer than usual for my food considering I was there at an off time, and my fries were a bit cold. However, the double-double animal style was probably the best burger I've had at In-N-Out. So...I like this location, and my good experiences in Arizona continue!"}
{"text":"Definitely the cheap eat of Las Vegas.  Taxi and Uber's everywhere in the lot   Liked the cheeseburger and the coke. Loved the behind the counter secret sauce."}
{"text":"It has been 13 years since I've had in n out. That's how long it's been since I last lived out west. Boy have I missed it. Service was very friendly and speedy. Burgers were as I remembered them. Very good. I imagine becoming a duke at this place. All the other fast food places are now off my list of burger joints. I'm so excited I think I'm gonna have a heart attack."}
{"text":"I REALLY do not get what all the raving is about with In N Out, to me they're very mediocre and uninspired burgers and fries, not especially skilfully cooked, certainly nothing to get in a lather about."}
{"text":"This In-N-Out location is probably one of the top on my list of personal favorites. The employees here, like most In-N-Out Burger locations, are truly awesome. They are all hard workers, respectful to the customers, and really make you feel welcome to be eating there.  The food is outstanding, as come to be expected from the burger craze this place has created around the American Southwest. It always arrives fresh off the grill, hot and juicy, cooked to perfection. The frys can be hit or miss, but if you're a fan of crispy, just ask them to be made \"well done.\"   If you're passing through on US60, headed back from a long day at the lake, definitely stop by and pay this place a visit. Caution: it will be busy on Sat/Sun around lunchtime!"}
{"text":"Showed up here at 12:57 AM a few nights ago -- we were driving from Tucson to Los Angeles, and pulled off on a whim, hoping this location had hours to 1:30 or 2 AM.  The place looked open, but empty -- we pulled into the drive through, asked if they were still open, and received a very enthusiastic \"For three more minutes!\"    I felt bad about it, but the cashier was nice, and the fellow who handed us our burgers jokingly said that they were made with love.  It seems odd to say it, but he sounded genuinely sincere.    Ordered two cheeseburgers with extra everything, a double-double, and two fries.  Fries were piping hot / crispy, single burgers were heavily laden with at least 2.5 times the normal veggies -- unusually large for 'extra everything.'    I wouldn't normally leave a review for an In N Out, but everyone we spoke to was very nice, and they served us so close to closing.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Madeline Ra was so nice, she was doing drive thru and the front counter at the same time and was very well at multi tasking it. She was so nice and timely about everything. Definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"Great burgers with an even better in and out burger sauce and crisp pickles!  Also the employees are always friendly and knowledgable!   Fries are also freshly cut and have a unique taste to them."}
{"text":"Great visiting and wishing we had one closer to home. The food was awesome and look forward to future vists"}
{"text":"The first time I ate at an In-N-Out was in Texas while visiting friends. The cheeseburger is tasty when you get it with lettuce and tomato, though the fries aren't my favorite. They'll do, just not my favorite. A cheeseburger, fries and large drink are about $6--a great deal compared to other fast food options. The shakes are really good. This one in suburban Phoenix has a good drive through, and they move the line pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Foods good as always. Wanted to buy an empty medium-size cup. Instead of charging me the price for a cup they wanted to charge me a dollar 68 like I was getting a full soda. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"This is probably the worse fast food I have ever ate, I literally ordered just some French fries, and then literally went I went to sit down, they called my number and handed me stale warm fries, never again will I go here"}
{"text":"Well! After many years I was finally able to take the advice of the esteemed Anthony Bourdain and try In-N-Out Burger! Yes it was an excellent (although busy) fast food experience. One of the very best fast food burgers. Was it the best? No! My vote still goes to Shake Shack.  P.S. One noted deficiency; although there is a very nice and simple menu, all the options for the fries were not listed. I had to ask if it was possible if to get cheese on my fires. After I ordered I learned that there is also the \"Animal\" option for the fries, which appeared to be cheese, chili, and some kind of special sauce. It would have been nice to try, but unfortunatley I'm not a mind-reader..."}
{"text":"De manière très simple :  Aller au In-N-Out est toujours une excellente idée !  N'oubliez pas de tester les \"animal fries\" avec votre double-double !"}
{"text":"Ya can't beat this place for great burgers at great prices.  You know, I always stay clear away from all fast food places whenever possible.  My kids and wife like burgers and we have tried all the latest places. From 20.00 burger places down to 1.00 dollar specials.  In the end, ya cannot beat Inn N Out on a regular \"gotta have it\" basis.  1.  The experience - Sure the other places are good to try out and have a completely different ambiance. I agree. Yet dollar for dollar the food here is comparable to most I have tried in all the places here in Vegas.  2.  The price - You cannot beat the prices. For a family of three, you can easily spend under 20.00.    3.  Parking and Access- Okay, this particular Inn N Out is on Serene and Eastern near the 215 in a strip mall. It's entrance is just before a huge freeway onramp. This makes turning in with raging drivers behind you a challenge at best. Now I am not sure why we see so many strip malls empty and with parking spots that look brand new after 5 years or more, but this place is always very busy. Parking can always be found, but perhaps not directly in front of the restaurant.   4.Take Out - They seem to focus on getting the take out customers and the car line moving, so even though it may seem very long, it moves fast.  They do a great job of having a server walk out with a remote ordering system and getting to each car faster than the car getting to the ordering kiosk.  The only issue is that the lines can wind around the parking lot and can be a bit confusing.  5.  The FOOD - There is some great stuff on the menu and many not on the menu...  Shakes - Great, tasty, perfect texture and thickness!  Burgers - This is the best.   Onions - Be sure to tell them grilled, raw or none Cheese - You can specify how many, the default is one Lettuce - FRESH and CRISPY! Tomato- Big hunking slice.  Meat - The perfect size. You can have a single, double double which is 2 patties and 2 cheese. Protein Style - Wrapped in lettuce, without the bun  Not on the official menu - Here is a small sampling, I am sure there is more! Animal Style - A Cheeseburger with mustard, extra sauce, pickle and grilled onion. 3 x 3- Three patties and three cheese 4 x 4 - You know the drill Flying Dutchman- I haven't tried this one, but it is two patties and a cheese, that is IT. Fries Animal Style - Yep you got it.  GK says why didn't I review this place before as it is the best deal for a great burger.  Check it out!   PS, they can be very busy during the normal lunch and dinner time so try varying your time to not be frustrated!"}
{"text":"Coming rare in here. But I love the place. Simple, tasty, affordable. That's why they are always busy!!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite fast food place. I won't eat a hamburger anywhere else! Everything from the bun, to the burger to the fries are always fresh. The bun is always toasted. The burger is perfectly cooked and juicy. I love the sauce and always ask for extra packets. I always order animal burger and animal fries. In my opinion, that's the only and best way to get in n out. And for the past 10+ years of eating here, it's always consistent."}
{"text":"This In N Out is definitely the best fast food restaurant out there. It isn't over priced and you feel as If you're eating a real meal. All the ingredients including the beef tastes fresh and made to order which sadly is a rare thing these days. My personal favorite is the double double protein style. There's just something about the combination of meat wrapped in lettuce that makes it irresistible. Whenever I am hungry and see an In N Out in sight, I will definitely stop buy for a meal."}
{"text":"Got into Vegas at about 1030 today!  I was bagged. I had to get up at 4am and be down at Bellingham Airport by7 am for an 8 am flight!  Yikes!    Anyways the first stop after checking into the hotel was to grab some lunch. What better staple food than the good old American Burger, fries, and a fountain soda pop?    In N Out Burger was stacked with people. I bet there were a good 50 people either ordering food or waiting for their order to show up!  My friend turned to me and said this place is a gold mine!  Thanks for the heads up Captain Obvious!  Haha  The food was hot and arrived in a timely manner. It was good wholesome food!  Nothing super duper great but not crappy either. Guess I would categorize a meal here as 'common'. Nothing to write home about but if you're around here you've got to try it out!"}
{"text":"There are no words for how good In-N-Out burgers are. I've been comparing burgers I eat to In-N-Out and I don't think I've found a competitor. It's delicious and cheap at the same time, who can beat that? Cheese burger with L/T and onions and extra pickle with animal fries with lots of spread please!!The spread is oh my... the nectar of gods!"}
{"text":"Old fashion hamburgers were great just hamburgers w ketchup and mustard. The fries are great. We have to have whenever we fly to Vegas for our annual trip. Can't eat till next year!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Husband and I went here for a post-flight snack while in Vegas. He was intrigued by this place given all the hype and the fact that there are no In-N-Outs on the east coast.   He ordered the double double and the burger met his expectations. I got the classic hamburger. Overall, the bun was very soft & slightly toasted and patties were fresh. Would eat again if ever on the west coast."}
{"text":"Okay I had to included In-N-out burger on one of my reviews even though I eaten at the one in La Palma, Barstow, Las Vegas, San Diego, Valencia, Camarillo, Vacaville, Farfield, and Gilroy. I probably eaten at more, but when I go outlet shopping, there is usually and In-N-out there.  Anyways the quality is still the same through.  I did the Las Vegas one because of all of the lights and stuff =)  I should buy a shirt one day to show my support.  I like getting the 4x4 when I am starving and the animal style fries even though they charge you double the rate now for them. The milk shakes are a little too thick and hard to sip however, but other than that Inn-N-out that is what a hamburger is all about."}
{"text":"First time I ever got it to go and NEVER AGAIN!! my burger was all falling apart we got shorted a fry and the worst part... The LONGEST BLACK HAIR IN MY HUSBANDS BURGER . I will stick to dining in as I always have since I moved here 9 years ago. I won't say never eating there but am saying never gonna go thru the drive Thru for take out !! EVER . I was gonna give it one star but this is the first time this has happened so I gave it middle stars"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing. My standard order is a double-double with fries and a chocolate shake- sometimes I'll splurge with an order of cheesy fries instead (I know there's a secret menu, but I don't like anything but cheese on my burger). While the food is great, the place is always packed (because, let's face it, everyone loves In 'N Out). If you plan on dining in, you have to play a game of stalking tables. You know, place your order and then prowl around the dining area waiting for some unsuspecting customers to finish eating and then snatch up their table (preferably after they get up- you don't want to be too over zealous). Crowded dining area aside, this place is great and I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"It was very good, I would totally go back again and again. The Double Double was good, Animal Style Fries are Amazing."}
{"text":"I gotta say this is my favorite in N out location. I come here often maybe once a week. Great customer service,  this place tends to get busy but their still very nice and fast.  My fries are always perfect never overdone like at other locations, it's very clean. And They always acknowledge my daughter and bring her stickers which she loves."}
{"text":"First time ever as we don't have this in my home town and am visiting Phoenix. Stopped by after last night's 1975 concert. It was worth the wait. The hype is true it was delish and very friendly service.The staff was smiling and attentive. Thanks guys really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I was told to get a burger from here. No regrets! Glad they don't have these in Halifax or I'd be in trouble.  5 STARS! We went through the drive thru and this location was on point! (I don't know if they are all like this as this is my only experience with this chain.)  Excellent customer service! You can see the workers enjoying their night? their job?  They looked like they loved their work.  I messed up and said I was eating in my car (as opposed to taking it home to eat) because I've never been asked that question in a drive thru before. The guy was so understanding as he was handing me a placemat and he ran to tell them to pack it up for take home and all with that friendly 'I'm here to serve you' demeanor. THANK YOU!  YUMMY! This is good fast food!  No next day hangover LOL - amazing since this was eaten at midnight - no nightmares nor next day complications.  And I got the burger, fries and chocolate shake.  AFFORDABLE! GOOD VALUE! TASTY! SMILES!  I'm a happy camper :) You wanna go to here ;)"}
{"text":"Crazy busy. Consistent with all California In-n-Out burgers I have been to (which is a lot of them - may 20+ different locations)"}
{"text":"It had been a while since I had been to an In N Out, and I figured I would give it another chance.  I've lived in California twice, and everyone there is obsessed with the place.  I can remember my first time visiting and thinking, meh, it's just ok.  So, I walked in to the Dysart location and stood in line for fifteen minutes and then waited ten more minutes for my food.  My opinion: meh.  Their fries are good, but their burger is nothing special.  Five Guys and Whataburger beat it hands down, every day of the week.  So next time I was hungry, that's exactly what I did....go across I10 and get something that I enjoy."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is probably one of the best fast food chains out there!  This location has great service and great food!  My \"go to burger\" is the number 2 combo (cheeseburger) with whole grilled onion (whole onion as opposed to the little squares), mustard fried (pickles always okay I don't discriminate), and chopped chilis (banana peppers)!  Try it and you can thank me later!  Most of my friends order this now too!  Do it!"}
{"text":"Every single time I eat at this location my order comes out either wrong or not cooked right. I've never had a problem with any other In-N-Out like I do this one. My fries were burnt to a crisp on my last visit. SO burnt that the inside was dehydrated and had a wood like texture. It felt more like a weapon than a damn French fry. I only received half my order on the visit before that and the visit before that was so badly butchered it left my mouth hanging open!. My requested #3 double protein wrap, no spread was just the opposite! They made it with triple spread and bun. I just don't get it! The only reason WHY I keep going to this one is because of proximity. So now I'm forced to eat inside because I can't trust them enough to go thru the drive-thru! What gives?! WAKE UP!!"}
{"text":"FINALLY.  It has arrived on the strip. Before when I'd come to Vegas, I would hop a cab over to the In-n-out to satisfy my craving for the fatty juicy burgers that would be adding greatness to my handles of love. And then, when there was Lyft/Uber, I started ridesharing it to this fine fast food establishment.    Now I can just cross the friggin street to get a double double or two. Yes, I'll have fries with that.    Definitely one of my favorite fast food burgers. So the fries are fresh and crispy, the burger is tender and juicy and the service is top notch. Nice fresh tomato slices and pieces of lettuce to boot.  The employees were so friggin nice I almost felt like I was on the set of Pleasantville. Food came out reasonably fast despite how busy it was. Who am I kidding? Even if it wasn't fast I would've waited to satiate my craving for this old west coast great."}
{"text":"Second time having burgers from this chain fast food place and awesome again! You can't go wrong haha Also- kudos to the drive thru service line at this location! There were about 15 cars waiting when we pulled up and we had our food in our hands within 5 minutes! Awesome! I'm back in NYC and craving a burger from here again! Ugh!! LoL"}
{"text":"Oh In-N-Out, how I love thee!! Right off the 515 Sunset exit in Henderson, NV - this legendary burger joint is easy to get to.  Double double with grilled onions, strawberry shake and animal fries = happiness!!"}
{"text":"The best burger joint in the world, no competition. No other fast food chain comes close. I don't care if they serve a side of Jesus with it, for these babies, I'll eat him too! Love love love this place. Wherever we plan on visiting the west coast, we make sure we look up how far we are from this place so we can go. It's that good."}
{"text":"ANIMAL STYLE SINGLE PATTI @12am hit the spot. Great 1st newbie experience :) I had to fight myself not to go for another round.  No other words needed to describe that it was awesome. I savored that first and last bite."}
{"text":"Clean, fresh and delicious. The staff was extremely friendly. The restaurant was very clean for 2pm in the afternoon."}
{"text":"4 stars simply because I AM A FAN!  I love love love the In-n-Out double-doubles and the animal-styled fries!  This location near the Strip was busy.  I had waited 15-20 minutes in the drive-thru past midnight; the line was long but the foods were totally worth the wait!  Juicy meat patties, melted cheese, and the \"Animal\" sauce, OMG!! Just delicious!  I wish the burger chain would come down to Houston, TX just like Carl's, Jr.  I keep my fingers crossed."}
{"text":"Went right before closing time , everyone was still upbeat unlike alot of places where the person would be In a rush and ready to leave. The food wasn't sloppily made , and it actually tasted better then any of the times I have had in n out before .the wait was a little long for it to be 1 car in line , but that's quality"}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with an in n out burger.  Pro tips: add chopped chiles inside your burger for a kick.  Don't like the fries soft? Ask for well done !"}
{"text":"Right next to campus and a great place to get away when you are tired of the Dining Commons."}
{"text":"Outstanding fast food restaurant that serves a great burger for a reasonable price. I highly recommend the Protein Burger with onions of course. What's a hamburger without onions?  Staff is great and friendly with the right attitude aimed at making sure the customer is satisfied. Only complaint, is I wish there was one in the Happy Valley area."}
{"text":"Double Double Animal Style!   The highlight of my trips Cali and Vegas!  The lines are always long, the food is always good, the service is friendly and you'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"I didn't always like this. For the longest time I had a huge distaste for In N Out..but recently my taste's have changed. When I want a great cheeseburger I have been coming here the last few times and I really like it.  There are a few things that I really like, it's extremely clean which I love. You can see the kitchen sparkle!!! It's cheap..we got 4 cheeseburgers, 2 fries and 2 drinks for $15!   I don't like the fries too much...they get kind of hard and crunchy once they get cold. Their milkshakes are awesome!!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out prides itself on being one of the first hamburger stands and having stayed the same over the course of half a century. I can definitely admire a business that lasts that long, but it seriously is time this place made a few updates.  One of the things this place is proud of is that it makes all its own food. No store-bought buns or anything like that here - there are windows all up and down the drive-thru, so that you can see your food being made. The end result is buns on your burger that best the competition, and some of the most delicious fast food fries around.   The food is excellent, but it all goes downhill from there. First and foremost, there is almost no variety on their menu. They pride themselves on not changing it, and this is as much a weakness as a strength. As a result, the place has NO CHICKEN PRODUCTS. Don't like burgers? Sucks to be you if someone drags you here (unless you like making a meal out of bread and fries.) Also, the service is hit and miss - I have ordered a plain cheese sandwich, and ended up with a burger patty in there many times (even though I said I wanted a damn cheese sandwich - NOT a burger.) And why is this place's line always so damn long? Come on, people, it's not THAT great!  In-N-Out has been around for years and still stands fairly strong. But against other fast food giants that aren't afraid to try new things and add items to their menu, they are the metaphorical dinosaur on the way to extinction. Their food is good, but not worth going out of your way for - especially considering the wealth of other fast food choices in the area."}
{"text":"I came here to have my first In N Out Burger, and I was not disappointed!  I had a double double, animal style fries, and a milkshake.  When I'm on vacation, I don't like going to the same place more than once... we went back to In N Out."}
{"text":"Was in on May 18th. Place was super duper busy at 12:30 PM.  Parking lot was \"packed with traffic\" and I had a hard time getting through the parking lot! There are several Fast Food places tucked in here and not enough room to flow In & Out ( pun intended) to any of these locations. Cluster!!  Anyway, I was mailed a coupon for a FREE burger  so opt'ed to use it before it expired.Got the standard cheeseburger & homemade hand cut French Fries for $1.89.ALL meals are made fresh to order! They will ask ; if you want onion either raw or grilled.  Service was quick and well organized. Clean kitchen and friendly employees. Enjoyed my meal & will plan to go back again during the \"off hours\" as this roadway is just to jammed up during the lunch rush!"}
{"text":"Fresh baked bun + tasty beef + fries made from whole potatoes = BLISS  I salivated when I watched the dude toss the enormous potatoes into the cutter.  Insanely delicious fries and not greasy.   The double cheeseburger puts mcdonalds, and almost every other burger joint, to shame. I'm a lover of this place.  No half pounders here so order the DOUBLE fo shizzle!"}
{"text":"Always come to this location, staff are usually friendly but I do not appreciate when this one particular girl (looked Asian, possibly Filipino) gave me the most disgusting look ever, looked at me up and down and rolled her eyes, when I was just simply waiting for my order. I did not even speak to her or anything. Probably miserable about her life and where she works at but she does not have to take out her attitude on other people."}
{"text":"Burgers regret staff was friendly courteous cleanliness of the inside was not the best and the fries sucked"}
{"text":"As an East Coast girl, I have to say that I prefer Five Guys, where not only are the burgers good, but the fries are decent. In-N-Out Burger's fries are pale and pasty, not golden and crispy. But yes, the burgers are good, plus \"animal style\" is fun, etc etc.  The key here is that (to reiterate previous reviews) you CAN walk from the Strip, but it takes about 30 minutes and is difficult to figure out, because Vegas off-strip isn't designed for pedestrians. You're literally crossing a highway, and only one side of the street has sidewalk. And it's not the side that has the In-N-Out Burger.  And yes it was very busy, but we didn't have wait too too long."}
{"text":"The only burger joint I would eat more, why.. It's fresh and natural.. You don't feel bloated because it being fresh, which means it healthier then McDonald's. I always go here once a week. And I suggest everyone should as well."}
{"text":"Great double cheeseburger! The French fries was okay.   The bad: Longggg wait time (super busy) My French fries was stale"}
{"text":"I don't get out to In-N-Out country too often, but when I do, I always make a stop.   This as my first visit to this location and it did not disappoint.   The servers were awesome, professional and super quick.   I used to work in fast food, and there is no better attitude in fast food service than In-N-Out Burger.     I had a double double animal style, animal style fries and a neopolitan shake.   Not the healthiest meal out there, but it was delicious.     As always the food was great, but the service here was just top notch.  Kudos to the folks that operate the business and take pride in their service.   Thank You."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger place! There's always a wait but for good food and friendly staff I don't mind. Since moving back to AZ from CO my husband and I have eaten here almost every week!"}
{"text":"This In-N-Out location is a must visit for anyone coming to Las Vegas from the East Coast.  It's relatively close to the strip and like all In-N-Out location has the same level of service and quality that you come to expect from all their locations.  There is also a small In-N-Out gift shop next door so you can buy all the In-N-Out swag for your poor East Coast friends that have to settle for McDonald's or Burger King."}
{"text":"Simple menu. ..tasty burger. ..fresh cut fries. ..low cost.  Customer service was even great. Thanks Terrance!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! The food is always amazing in quality and i've never had an incorrect order or even the slightest attitude from a single employee here. The wait time can be a bit long, but for the quality of service and food it's worth it to me."}
{"text":"I have always ordered my burger protein style, animal style, extra pickles. The gal at the register put no onions on my order which eliminates animal style since it contains onions.  I told her how it works and she said I was wrong.  She completely ignored my protein style request.  I ended up with no dinner."}
{"text":"I ate at this location once at 1am while in Vegas.  I ordered a single animal style, and well done fries (plain on this visit). The burger was good and fresh.  The well done fries, upon first taste, we good.  It dawned on me that even though I had ordered well-done fries on my last visit, that clearly they were not well done.  These were extremely crispy and oily, and it was a little too much for me.   The food came out in about 10 minutes and it was all piping hot.   If someone were to try to compare both Five Guys and In-N-Out, I think that by far this locations close proximity to Five Guys would make for an excellent head-to-head comparison.  Unfortunately, I lack the stomach and the time to do that."}
{"text":"I'm not a converted, but it is A-Ok.  I get why people like these burgers, to quote Jules Winnfield from Pulp Fiction: \"That is a tasty burger!\"  Well aware even after only one other In-N-Out experience, I went in with the secret menu in mind.  I ordered a double-double, animal style; an order of well done animal style fries, and a fountain drink.  When my order first came out, I had just plain fries.  The order was sent back and when it all came back out, the animal-style fries were correct, but the fries were not \"well done\".  Annoyed, but instead of sending it back again, I took the order as-is.  It cost me $11 and some change, a little more expensive than most locations, but we are also talking Vegas.   Fresh ingredients, fast food, and all-in-all a food eating decision made worse with the feelings of gluttony after consuming so much fatty goodness.    I wish I could do an eat off with a hot Five Guys and a Hot In-N-Out at the same time, but I wash unable to do so with this visit."}
{"text":"The service at this In and Out was absolutely took notch. You would swear you were actually in a restaurant with a server. Kevin one of the attendants or servers so was pleasant and nice but also went around to ask each table how their meal was and throw finished items away. Super impressed! Great recruiting In and Out the service was great."}
{"text":"I love IN N Out Burger Always friendly Always clean Always great prices (except the price has gone up 2 times in a year)   I still think that it is a great value.  I  have been eating here for two years and I have only experienced one drive through cashier that was not friendly.   The worker are always clean and very helpful. Yes... I will be back  Looking forward to a location opening up in Surprise, AZ"}
{"text":"Great burgers, great attitude in the store.  I'm a little overenthusiastic about In-N-Out being an east coaster, but whatever.  Not a big fan of the fries, though."}
{"text":"One of my favorite in n out locations. I also like the location next to fiesta mall. When I'm dieting I get the cyzzburger.  How to order: Double meat, with or without onions, no spread ketchup and mustard only, extra tomatoes, and add pickles.  Macros: 412 calories   16F / 41C / 26P  Should be around $3.99"}
{"text":"As far as a fast food burger goes, this is one of the best.  I live on the east coast so the first time I ate at In N Out I didn't know about the not so secret menu,  but thanks to Yelpers next time it was animal style !"}
{"text":"I love this chain. I always get a double with cheese and my wife and i split a fry. The burger is great! Fresh tomatoes and lettuce, very good! Wish they had one in Vancouver, Wa!"}
{"text":"What can I say? It's In-N-Out Burger! Small menu, but big on taste! Being from Hawaii, I look forward to In-N-Out Burger whenever I am on the mainland continental U.S.  They have yet to open an In-N-Out Burger in Hawaii!  The burgers, simple, but juicy and mouthwatering, will tickle your taste buds!  The French fries are always fried to perfection! I always order the Double-Double and animal fries whenever I am here! Don't forget to order the milkshake while you're at it too, they are to die for! :D  There's only so much I can describe a fast food chain burger, but I think juicy, delicious, mouthwatering will speak for itself! These are really, really good!  Parking: although most In-N-Out Burgers in Las Vegas have ample parking, they tend to always be full! And yes, that includes the line inside!  On a recent visit, I befriended a trucker from Boise, Idaho who had made a pit stop at In-N-Out Burger! He had told me he was on the road for hours and said he couldn't wait for this particular pitstop! I was a bit surprised, but he said there aren't any In-N-Out Burgers where he lives! And there aren't any on his usual truck routes! Wow, and I had thought In-N-Out was everywhere! I had also noticed a lot of the cars in the parking lot were out of state license plates ranging as far as the east coast, south, Midwest and the west coast! They come from all over just to experience these mouthwatering burgers, French fries and milkshakes!  On this visit while waiting for my order I conversed with people from Maryland, New York and Tennessee and they, too, look forward to In-N-Out Burger as they do not have locations in the south or east coast that they are aware of.  So the next time you are in Las Vegas, make a stop at one of the In-N-Out chains! You have to taste the experience!"}
{"text":"This is a review for the In-N-Out Burger on W. Sahara Ave (just down the street of Palace Station). For those staying downtown this is the closest location (from Main Street head towards Las Vegas Blvd South and make a right on Sahara Ave).  This location may out of the way of the Las Vegas Strip, however, it is also not as crowded and frequented by visitors as much as the one off Tropicana Ave. One reason being this location does not have the souvenir shop. But if you're going just to satisfy your craving, be sure to check this location out the next time your in Vegas! Don't get me wrong, this location can still fill up too, however, the locations closest to the Las Vegas strip are frequented by a lot of tourists from all over too. :)  Being from Hawaii, I always look forward to In-N-Out Burger! Still crossing my fingers for a location to open up in Honolulu, Hawaii.  People who have never been here always tell me, \"small menu?\". Yeah, small menu, but big on taste! If you're doing it right, you don't need a big menu! The burgers are always juicy and mouthwatering!  The French fries are always  crisp and fried to perfection! I have since learned there are items you can order that ARE NOT on the menu board! Whaaaat? You gotta find out or ask someone who knows! Yummy!!! As always, I always order the Double-Double Meal A, with a side order Double-Double whenever I am here! (Haha). The milkshake is also to die for!   There's only so much I can describe a fast food chain burger, but you gotta try it to believe it! Juicy, delicious and mouthwatering!  Most In-N-Out Burgers in Las Vegas have ample parking, however, they can fill up pretty quickly especially during lunch and dinner/late night hours. The line inside to order may appear long as you walk in but I've noticed they tend to move fairly quickly.  The next time you are in Las Vegas, make a stop at In-N-Out for the experience! :p"}
{"text":"This place makes other burger places look like a joke.  I grew up near one of the original In-N-Out's in California so I have grown up in a sense eating these great little burgers. Whats really not to like about here? The menu is small so its not gonna take you 30 minutes to pick from the menu.  The fries are cut right in front of you so you know its not from the freezer, the burgers have a great season to them. Only thing I wish is that the chocolate milkshake at this location didn't suck so hard.  Go for the secret menu. If you dont know what it is, google it and just go insane."}
{"text":"First time and I loved it.  It's true what they say, you don't go there for the fries.  But the burger and shake was amazing!"}
{"text":"Sorry In-N-Out fans, I don't understand the hype!!!  This was my first visit to this place and I have to say that I am not impressed? First off the customer service could use some work, but it's what I expect from the people under 21, these days. No enthusiasm or interest in what they are doing at all. The second thing was the burger patty itself, it was small and bland, the bun and toppings were just too much for such a small piece of meat.  Lastly the fries, in. Y opinion were not even done property, they could've used an extra minute in the fryer.  I understand growing up eating at certain place can sometimes skew the reviews that people may have about certain places. I know, I have a places like that, that are near and dear to my heart, but your average person just doesn't understand.  So I have to wonder if In-N-Out is a place like this.   I will give it another shot the next time I am in a city that has one and is near by, but I will not go out of my way to find one. The burger is pretty simple, so I don't see how much can change, and fries are timed."}
{"text":"I like this place for a cheap meal but the food is always fresh. The burgers are always juicy and fresh but thin. That's okay cause they are so good. The fries are so good and freshly cut.  Service is always fast and friendly. Good burger place that we will always come visit."}
{"text":"I did manage to come back to this In-n-Out Burger a few weeks later when in Vegas for a work conference.  The food was just as good as usual, so nothing new to report there.    Some information for those who may be staying in a hotel on the Strip without a car, as I was this time, and are wondering about walking to In-n-Out, as I did. It is doable as long as you take the right approach.    If you are coming from Las Vegas Boulevard (the Strip) and want to walk down Tropicana Avenue over top of the I-5 freeway, you must stay on the south side of Tropicana Avenue. That is the side with the Excalibar Hotel as opposed to the north side with the New York New York Hotel (and Casino, but that is superfluous in any Vegas hotel name).  When you get to the street across from In-n-Out, you cannot cross Tropicana immediately but must cross Dean Martin Boulevard, then Tropicana, then Dean Martin again.  The direct route has no crossing signal.  Why did you have to stay on the south side of Tropicana when In-N-Out is on the north side?  You will come to a spot without sidewalks, and in that traffic you do not wish to take your life into your hands.  The good news about the walk?  The food is worth the trip,and you can feel virtuous enough from exercising - hey, you burn calories in the 100 degree heat - that you can add a milkshake without guilt."}
{"text":"This was the only place that I had flagged that was a MUST for my trip to Vegas. After drinking all day, we got a cab over the bridge to In-n-Out burger. We got there at an ideal time as right after we arrived, about 9 people walked in.   I ended up going with a two-by-two animal style with fries and a drink. Service was quick and the main guy at the cash was super nice, chatting about menu items with me. The restaurant itself wasn't too busy when we arrived but was very clean and well lit, if a tad sterile.   Yes, this burger lives up to all the hype. No, the fries don't (perhaps if I'd gotten them animal style, they would have, but they were just ok), but the burger is really the gem here. I'm really sad we don't have these in Canada and I'm hoping they either bring them up or that I head to the states again soon to try another one! BOMB burger! Yum!  We were worried we would have trouble getting a cab back but we happened up on a cab driver coming back out of In-n-Out so we got a ride with him. Not sure if that'd be possible all the time though, this location is slightly out of the way so you may either have to walk back or try and find a cab stand somewhere...."}
{"text":"Burgers and fries, simple menu but they do it well. Shakes are made with real ice cream so they are tasty. My favorite is the half chocolate and half vanilla shake.   Get grilled onions on the burger, they grill them up right to make them taste sweet. And ask for a side of chili peppers to ice your burger a little spice."}
{"text":"My favorite and only \"fast food\" I'll go to! Always polite, and get my order correct. Food is hot and fresh. You can taste the quality, no comparison to any other burger joint! Five stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Best fast food burgers...not even close. Super fresh ingredients and the best burger buns. The fries are best fresh so I recommend dining in but still good if you're a short drive away.   If you haven't had the Animal style fries then wake up and go immediately. They're amazing. Not everyone knows about them but you get their amazing spread, melted cheese and grilled onions on them. To die for!"}
{"text":"Clean, fast, inexpensive and omg tasty! Friendly service, friendly employee's. This is the only one I have eaten at here in AZ but it is by far a wonderful taste bud teaser! Fresh everything and not one messed up order in 8 visits."}
{"text":"This place is soooooo busy, but its right by the strip so it doesn't surprise me. I love in and out so no complaints! They have a cool little gift shop here and lots of outside seating so you dont have to beat anyone down for a table."}
{"text":"Our boys love this place, and so do I. The drive-through line is always so busy so we always go inside to eat. I know it's just a burger but something about their burgers have me hooked. Great customer service, restaurant is always clean and food is always delivered fast, unless the restaurant is busy, then it takes a little time but that o.k.  I get the double, fries and a diet coke. My wife loves the animal fries, it's not on the menu so ask for it if your taste buds happy.  Good prices, good go to food on busy days."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for a fast fresh prepared as you order burger this is the place to go.  I recomend doing a google seach and looking at their 'secret' menu that list multiple different options and variations ontheir food.  I am a huge fan of the mustard grilled cheeseburger.  Fries are delish.  This isn't gourmet but they dont pretend to be.  The decor is 50-60'2 style throwback drive in."}
{"text":"I'm so glad it wasn't as packed as it usually is. Two double double protein style and one double double burger. Also had to get animal style fries with extra sauce and some peppers as well."}
{"text":"This location has the hardest workers. I watched them the entire meal and whether they had their own station or not they were always helping out somewhere else. Very nice work ethic for a fast food place!"}
{"text":"Starving so thought we should stop by I ordered animal style burger w/ no tomato and pickles! Then other cheese burger with no tomato and onion opened the bag this Burger has tomato and fries looks like it's not fresh and looks like it's leftover from what they made before  I'm so disappointed smh"}
{"text":"I don't understand why so many people fuss about this fast food chain. It's just a plain burger, VERY thin patty and lots of vegetables. I live in the East coast and tried their burger two separate times but still same reaction. It's just a plain burger."}
{"text":"I guess I missed out on the hype of this regional gem. Coming from Florida, we didn't have an In-n-Out but man was social media packed with pictures of this place. I just don't eat fast food burgers anymore but if I did, I guess I'd choose this over Mickey D's. The burgers taste REAL and the toppings are sweet. But the fries taste like cardboard... Even with them being animal style.   I just don't find myself returning to this place but the staff is nice, store is clean, and the burgers are decent."}
{"text":"We had great service, surprisingly no long line but the service was a bit slow, but that's typical. Our burgers were great, drowned in spread. The only thing wrong was not enough grilled onion."}
{"text":"Best Hamburgers on the west coast.  Usually a long line, but its well worth the wait.  This family owed restaurant is opening new locations throughout the southwest.  From Baldwin Park CA, they are now in Nevada, Arizona, and Texas.  If you live west of the Mississippi they might be opening or opened one in your neck of the woods. Hamburgers are made with the freshest ingredients and are made to order.  Beware of the hidden menu it becomes addicting.  I like the fries extra crispy.  The Milk shakes bring a happy ending to a wonderful meal.  If you are heading through the drive thru and they have a double order lane, pay extra attention who is ahead of you.  Usually the business guy is ordering for more than one.  The same with the pick up truck guy, he might be getting the entire work crew an order.  This is not the lane you want to pick.  Instead opt for the guy in the sedan all bye himself usually single or with a friend type cars are the best option because they know what they want and will get through a lot quicker.  Good luck and the best part is you can write a review while you wait for your meal like I am right now! Cheers!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to find out there was In-N-Out near by when I moved to Arizona. Being a California girl this is a major plus. Another major plus is that this location is amazing. My boyfriend and I tend to have very complicated orders and they have yet to mess them up. I also receive fast and friendly service from all of their staff members wether I'm going through the drive through or dining in.   Sometimes it looks very busy from the outside of the store, but they are still able to get your food to you fairly quickly. It gives you time to go to the bathroom, get your drink and find a seat, anyways."}
{"text":"I don't like fast food!  I can't eat at McDonald's, Jack's or Burger King... However In N Out Burger makes a good burger, it doesn't have that nasty fast food smell when you walk in the door.  If your in Henderson and need a quick bite, this the the place for a quick burger and fries!"}
{"text":"While I was visiting Arizona I decided to try in and out burger for the first time and wasn't particularly excited with the results. Did not care for the french fries at all they were incredibly dry and Styrofoam consistency with no flavor. The burger however was all right. Always curious about why everybody loved in and out burger so much I had to try. You know what they say when in Rome. However it was very anti-climactic and I'm not sure that I would ever get an in and out burger again."}
{"text":"so a friend was in town from LA, and she wanted to go here and have me order a grilled cheese (burger without a burger) 'cause \"they are soooo good\".  And being a vegetarian, I decided that her \"sooooo good\" statement was true.  OK, so we arrive -- the place is PACKED.  I mean, it's more packed than a line outside Tiger's MGM hotel room.  So seriously, an HOUR wait for the food.  And people were hovering over tables -- waiting for someone to leave.  NO JOKE.  Then the food arrived.  The \"grilled cheeses\" were awful.  The fries were on the cold side, and nothing special.  Are people NUTS?  Why is this place so popular?!?!?!  I swear sometimes."}
{"text":"For drive thru fast food, quality was above ave but food takes long to come out  for fast food. But can't complain if the food is fresher."}
{"text":"I have been a customer for about 8 years. I had always loved it. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE & 4EVER LASTING QUALITY HAD ME. but the last 2 time I ate in with my 2 children & husband have been poor. :( Tge 1ST time....The cashier was extremely rude & unresponsive- like an annoyed robot who hated her job and whose job was to find every flaw in my ordering choice of words....only to find a hair in my 1st bite of fries....and 50 seconds later my husband to find a hard piece of plastic ( that could have been confused with a piece of one of their tables in his burger....2nd time was today...the cashier stared @ me...and As I order did not respond to let me know i could continue, so I said, \"Do you have that?, may I continue?\" -Rudeness and so uninviting...unresponsive....unkind.....When they called my #, I asked for spread...the employees tossed 3 of them on my tray....I said \"Thank u\" as i smiled...he turned around as i was saying \"thank u\". so i said \"u r welcome\" to myself.. #TOTALRUDENESS HAS INVADED A PLACE I THOUGHT SO HIGHLY OF B4."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is amazing! There is not much I can write here that hasn't been said before. just order everything animal style and you will leave full and happy. This is some of the best fast food on earth."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love In-N-Out Burger?!?! The little angel on my left shoulder telling me you will never lose those 5 lbs if you eat that burger!   This place should be one of the 7 godly sins! It's so yummy and absolutely horrible for your arteries. I would love this place way more if it could taste so good and also be calorie free!  Great for the occasional cheat meal."}
{"text":"Typically good service and great quality;however, more recently if you go there you'll notice that the food is put together sloppy and the staff is in a rush. The quality is going down but the overall taste, value and service is still much better than the competition out there."}
{"text":"I needed to do a little Christmas shopping and the ladies here were absolutely awesome!!   They had most of the stuff I needed without making it too obvious for the person I was buying the stuff for.  (Couldn't leave him at home... haha..)  I would totally come back here because the prices are reasonable and the customer service is wayyyyyyy over the top for me!!! Good job In-N-Out team!!!"}
{"text":"Good location whether getting on or off the freeway. Super quick drive thru even when busy. Always friendly."}
{"text":"Fast service! Friendly workers. Not the cleanliest location though... You would think they would have one or two people covering the whole restaurant wiping down tables and taking the trash out."}
{"text":"First time coming here and had a great experience! When we walked up there was a long line but didn't even wait in line for 5 minutes and we were already at the front ordering ... they have 5-6 registers open and were quickly taking everyone's order... the staff was all very friendly from the front where you ordered to the back. Found seating quick and our food for the four of us came out in just 7 minutes .... any staff walking by us would ask if we needed anything or even at the end came and took our trash... also I have to add everyone working seemed to work together as a team and would help each other out ... the floor was a little dirty in one spot and I saw a worker walk by and say \"oh we gotta clean this!\" And then came back with a mop and someone to dry it up as she cleaned the floor ... great experience and will be coming back."}
{"text":"Food at In n Out is always great. So this review won't be on the food.   The restaurant is pretty dirty out of all the In n Outs I've been too. It's hard to find a table let alone a clean table."}
{"text":"My last visit would have been a Two Star but I've been often enough to know they are a Four Star. I'm pretty sure Abraham is the guy who took my order, and he was a Five! So happy to be there, offered me a water cup when I said no soda, just emanating joy. The burger though, it was sad, I asked it if it had had a death in the family, it didn't even crack a smile.   Maybe because I always get the Double, but this poor thing could have been vegetarian! Paper thin meat, I always get extra onions, and even that wasn't a lot! It was just sad. The fries weren't hot! i have NEVER bumped into that before at an In-n-Out, however I didn't ask them to fix it, and I know they would have. They happiness of the server made up for the sadness of the burger.  It was clean, and twice someone came out to clean again, even though they were slammed!  Always try to go when it isn't Lunch or Dinner rush! They run out of tables very quickly. Not a rush time and it's golden.  I asked the family next to me and they said the shakes are really good, I have never tried one, but will next time.  Parking, again, not during a rush is plenty, during those times though it can be awful.   If you go through the drive through they will ask if you're eating in your car and wrap your burger so that you can control it one handed! Awesomeness!"}
{"text":"In -n-out is crack in a bun. No not those kinda buns and not that kinda crack. Like the crack I have never smoked really.. The kind all the bad people in tv go out to find..  This place is always busy no matter what time of day. Crack burgers are good business. Number 1(double double) is my go to when I am extra hungry. Number 2(regular cheeseburger) will do the trick though. Always ask for grilled onions and ketchup. They have great shakes too, vanilla, strawberry or chocolate. I'm not too down for the animal style.. Don't judge..   I am just so glad they have In-N-Out in NV and i don't have to drive to CA to eat it. I may have just not moved here! It's that good!"}
{"text":"One of the best In-N-Out Burgers I've been to (let's not talk about the one near Embarcadero in San Francisco--meh). You know how burgers look in ads? Well ours looked camera ready and tasted even better than they looked. Extremely happy and helpful staff (almost thought we were in Stepford). Insanely fast drive thru service."}
{"text":"Why are you not in Hawaii??  The \"no store further than a 2 day's drive from a distribution center\" is so wrong!  Bitching aside, we were on vacay and staying at Encore.  My spouse still cannot fathom me spending $20 on a cab ride just to eat lunch here.  ATMOSPHERE: This location is super busy and it was the closest one to the strip, and nearby some schools as there were a ton of kids walking in.  And the amount of taxis dropping off tourists from the strip (including us) was outrageous.  FOOD: Double Double - My all-time fave.  The simple cheeseburger with spread tastes divine.  I have yet to try this animal style.  Fries -  I finally tried it animal style but meh, not a fan.  I'm more of a purist when it comes to fries.  FEEDBACK: PUT MAYBE 2 or 3 LOCATIONS ON LV BLVD PLZ.  It's so out-of-the-way if you are anywhere on the strip."}
{"text":"Probably the dirtiest in n out I've been to,maybe because it's super crowded.  The tables and bathroom was dirty.  When we were there the line wrapped around all the tables and almost out the doorway.   Otherwise it was as good as any other In-n-out.  Just expect it to be slow, dirty and busy."}
{"text":"This location should be called \"sit-n-wait\" at least 15 minutes for your order....   Even when they open at 10:30am, there is a line and there is a LONG wait no matter when you go.   I see burgers cookin', I see people working, but why the heck aren't the orders coming out? Are we so spoiled on how FAST McD's is?   OK, I don't mind waiting a few minutes, but NOT 10-15! What if you have to go to the restroom? You're stuck in that drive-thru burger line that doesn't move!  If I didn't crave the toasted buns, secret sauce, and juicy patty  I wouldn't bother coming back. Damn them for being so friendly too!  **Plus, it's NOT easy to get \"in\" and \"out\" here...the ONLY way to get to this location is by heading north on 83rd Ave and turn into the parking lot BEFORE you get to the light on Bell Rd....and this is the ONLY way out too. There is NO access from the JoAnn's/Penny's Home Store shopping center parking lot."}
{"text":"I loooooove this location since it's nearby but the customer service is always excellent here. Food is so fresh!! Yumm!!! I would recommend this location but so does everyone else so it is always crowded when I go."}
{"text":"You cannot get a better burger anywhere in the world. Period.  Shake Shack ain't got nothing on IN N Out. Period. Get it Animal Style or go home and get out of here. You should know better. Unless you're a vegetarian, in which case, you're probably not going to a burger joint, but they do have a Grilled Cheese so there is hope for you too."}
{"text":"Whover decided to put an In-N-Out Burger in Vegas is a god damn genius!  Are you hungover?  Do you want to shoot yourself?  Having an FML moment?  Well make your way to In-N-Out Burger!  After a night of drinking it will save your life.  Lost all your money gambling?  It's cheap!  Burger, fries, shake - simple and satisfying.  This place is ALWAYS packed so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"I've had In-N-Out in Vegas and LA and this location does not disappoint. This place is guaranteed to actually get your order right unlike most fast food places in the area... and imagine, YOU CAN ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PERSON WHO WORKS THE DRIVE THROUGH IS SAYING because English is their first language!"}
{"text":"This place must be used to the crowds, because it really seems like their staff has their service down to a science. Both times I've been in it's been very busy and the place is always clean and the food is always the same. As much as I like In & Out, I've had burgers I enjoy a bit more elsewhere. Something has to be said for the noticeably fresh ingredients. I love that this place is right off the freeway; it's a very convenient stop off. The In & Out company store is right across the parking lot for those looking to load up on In & Out merchandise."}
{"text":"Burgers are fantastic as always. Love that you can get a burger with lettuce instead of a bun.   Giving 5 stars because of the amazing customer service we received. I will be back again just because of how friendly all the staff was toward us."}
{"text":"Good, reliable, budget friendly burgers you can always rely on. The prices are unbelievably cheap, service is always friendly and even if there is a long line, it always moves quick. What's not to like?   Animal style fries are always good, and the shakes are very delicious too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Hi. I think IN-N-OUT BURGER should open one in boulder high way and palo verde Dr there's is more burgers places but IN-N-OUT BURGERS are way different from the competition. Thank you."}
{"text":"Ten Guys flavor for Three Guys pricing!  I think In-N-Out is a great value for the product you get, although if you get a single hamburger or cheeseburger the meat is too skinny to really taste. The fries are hit or miss, and I've had good ones but usually they are a little soggy, and sometimes over done. So for food, I probably give it 3.5 or 4 stars. But In-N-Out prides themselves on customer service, and it shows in their actions, which raises their rating. I have two stories to share about that.   This particular location is always clean, and the employees are always helpful and smiling. The manager here goes above and beyond even what I expect from an In-N-Out chain though, and on one occasion, when our car battery died, he tossed his keys to the cashier, who came out and gave me a jumpstart. It was an act I was very grateful for.  One time I had a bad food experience, when the fries were so overdone on a takeout order, I actually called the phone number on the receipt expecting the local manager. Instead I got a customer service rep (at 8pm Arizona time) who was very apologetic and sent me some coupons. More impressive, they followed up with me after I redeemed them to make sure that everything was to my satisfaction the second time, and then sent me a hand signed Christmas card that year.  They treat you right, especially at this location!"}
{"text":"If you have eaten here, you don't need a review.  But, everytime I eat at In-N-Out I think of this quote from Tucker Max's I Hope they Beer in Hell  \"I have only fallen in love three times in my life, and the first bite of that Double-Double was one of those times. The crispy bun complimenting the cool lettuce, the special sauce accentuating the fresh tomato, the sweet meat mixing with the salty cheese, all of it coming together in a harmonious medley of flavor thus far unseen on the American fast food landscape - I was smitten. It was the single greatest fast food meal in the history of civilization. Even though I was full, I immediately ate another Double-Double. I was nearly in tears at this meal, it was so transcendently excellent. Those fuckers should hire me as a spokesman. \""}
{"text":"We love in and out, we usually all get the Double/ Double with grilled onions and fries. I love it that they make their fries fresh and not frozen and the hambugers are not sitting under a heat lamp like some places. This location always keeps the place clean and you get in and out pretty quickly either thru the drive thru or going in. Prices are good as well."}
{"text":"I dont know why people give under 5 star on this place. With little money this is best food u could possibly get. Fresh vegies, meat is not greasy at all even bun was sweet and moisten. French fries all the way crunch until the last one. I know bathroom wasn't really clean and garbage can was consistency full but still total worth of every penny that I spend! In n out, God bless ur buisness!!!"}
{"text":"Uhhhh can i get a double double with extra toasted buns, grilled onions, extra spread, and no lettuce and tomato. Yo and lemme get a side of fries and a choclate shake. Fuck yes im tryna eat some ass"}
{"text":"This in and out is really close to me so sometimes if I'm lazy I'll just pick up a burger for dinner. Sometimes this location is busy, otherwise the drive through is not too bad. Customer service is always good as usual. And the burgers are good too!   No complaints!   The only thing is their buns are not as crispy as I would like. But the end of the burger the bun is a little soggy from the veggies and sauce. A crispier bun from being longer on the grill would be nice."}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out. Being from WA there isn't one close by so it's always nice being able to go whenever I'm in Cali. I've been to a few in Cali that were sadly disappointing. When I found out there was one in Vegas I knew I had to stop by when I was on my trip. The lines late at night can get long, yes, but they work quickly to get through it. I didn't feel like I was waiting forever in line or for my food for how busy it gets. And as far as seating goes the 3 times I was there on my trip (all at various hours in the evening) I had no problem finding a seat (both inside and out.) If you love In-N-Out and want some good cheap food check it out. Grab your food and head out to see the fountains and high roller."}
{"text":"\"IN-N-OUT, IN-N-OUT, IN-N-OUT.\" I heard wifey rave about every time i mentioned any burger joint. Unfortunately she could only rave about it and I couldn't try it because we live in the east cost and according to common knowledge the healthy fast food chain is only on the west coast and very popular there (as many of us have seen on Californication.)   On our trip (my first time) to Phoenix, Arizona to visit her family, I was bound to make a pitstop at the infamous IN-N-OUT. Of course my mother-in-law cooked a plenty to keep the both of us satisfied and so we could only venture on our last day there (a total of four days) which was unfortunate because I wanted to go for doubles and pack some to go on the airplane(didn't think of that before I left the establishment). Yes that is how good that place is.   I ordered a double burger and that sauce they use, my wife says it's pickles, ketchup and mayo all mixed in one little packet, is just amazing. Along side my amazing burger I had animal fries, they consisted of cheese and ground beef & more dressing.   The best part was that the food was inexpensive and there was a small menu so I didn't have to break my head choosing what I wanted and there is a drive thru.   The food was so good didn't get a chance to take pictures. Sorry Yelpers."}
{"text":"Born in Cali. Raised in Cali. Hands down - THE BEST Cheeseburger on this planet!! Glad there are a handful of In-N-Out's in Las Vegas. I wish they had a location in Hawaii. Until then, I'm more than happy to get my #2 Cheeseburger Combo fix on when visiting CA/NV.  This location is conveniently located in North Las Vegas off of Craig (Exit 48). I prefer this location, away from the Strip, for faster service and a table. An all beef patty, salt n peppered to perfection. Not greasy. Fresh veggies. Special sauce. Fresh cut fries. High five for a great meal that will only cost ya $6.10. Throw in an In-N-Out Las Vegas t-shirt for $12.00. Score!! You'll definitely find me wearing that thing on the island. If you can't eat it, wear it!  Plenty of parking available. Customer service on point. Drive thru convenient. Outdoor seating. Spacious indoor seating. Clean. Love it!  Well done, In-N-Out! No bun intended. ;-)"}
{"text":"What is there to say about In&Out that hasn't already been said? The Double Double animal style (an option on their \"Not so Secret Menu\") is out of this world. It's also $3.80 at this establishment. Say what?!? At a time when Shake Shake is selling burgers for twice the price, I'm amazed that In&Out is able to keep prices so low. The burger is juicy, delicious, just the right amount of everything put together into one taste explosion in your mouth. And the fries that go along with that? Freshly cut, and extremely tasty. I like throwing a bunch of salt over it but it's good on its own too.  For this particular location, I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that it wasn't as crowded as I expected. But I guess compared to the one in Barstow, any other location probably looks empty.  If you're in Vegas and want a burger, you can try a bunch of the fancy restaurants out there. But there's one place where you'll always get the best dependable burger on the west coast while also being light on your wallet (so you can spend it on other stuff in Vegas) - that's at In&Out."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, great quality food. I'm from the east coast and never understood the in n out hype but now I can say I am officially a convert. I think my boyfriend saying \"this tastes like a burger I would take off the grill at home\" sums the food up perfectly. It's not your typical frozen, preservative laden piece of meat. On top of that, the fries are fresh cut daily and are delicious. Would eat this over the other big name fast food joints any day of the week."}
{"text":"Great experience. Fast turn around singles need more meat.  Get fries \"animal style \" and it has processed cheese and grilled onions.  But over all A good experience."}
{"text":"This place is great! I have been going here for so many years and I've never had a bad experience! It's always clean and the food is always great, whether they're busy or not! Definitely a great choice for a good burger!"}
{"text":"I've seen the in-n-out burger sign for years. I found myself there after not listening to my GPS. I needed a quick bite after a looooooooooooong flight. How can one beat a double-double for $4? The double-double is made fresh, to order. The service is quick and the staff is friendly. Did I mention a double-double for $4?"}
{"text":"\"east coast till the day I die\"...but In-N-Out Burger was EVERYTHING.  During my stay in Las Vegas I had to go visit the famous fast food restaurant In-N-Out Burger. Wow!   Menu - Simple and easy to pick!  Service - Great!   Food - Delicious. Good juicy burger!  ( less salt on the fries - please.)   A must eat in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late night snack last night, the food is always great, but the employees had no rush to take care of us and walked past us several times before even reassuring us it would be a minute, they were just talking and laughing with each other. Even though when walking past the girl made eye contact with us several times. Disappointing service, food is always a 5 star."}
{"text":"Anyone from the east coast that does not visit an In and Out Burger when visiting the west coast is a fool.  Fries and burgers... that's it and they do them fresh and they do them right.  I rent a car just to insure I get to visit one."}
{"text":"SUPER CHEAP!!  This is located in Vegas and it was a wallet saver for sure! They have very small menu so it's really easy to decide what you want.  Their food was not bad for the price. Their staff are nice and friendly as well. I like how everything was simple.  It's extremely busy so you gotta wait a bit and I guess that's the downside of it.  Their milkshake was excellent too! I gotta have more of those next time I go!"}
{"text":"We come here often and I was rather surprised as to how bad their fries were this time.  I guess I better mention it next time I go. There were a lot of what looked like burnt pieces and they were not golden brown and crunchy. Maybe it was what was left over from the lunch rush? I hope not."}
{"text":"I've always heard it's the best. Maybe I caught them on a bad day. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't as great as we had always been told. There are much better places to go that don't have the hype surrounding them. Not a bad burger joint, just not the best."}
{"text":"burgers are great just like any other IN-N-Out but this location is very crowded"}
{"text":"I go to this location due to it's convenient location off of the 17 and when I'm missing home.   I've always done drive-thru here, so this is a review based on that.  Ordered my hamburgers with mustard and grilled onions, protein style and a side of fries. In-N- Out is pretty good about getting people through the drive-thru as quickly as possible and are very friendly in service. The only downside is in terms of portion/quality. The fries were overdone - crisp. The burgers were well wrapped in lettuce, had tomato and mustard. However, both burgers were sprinkled with grilled onions and had tiny burger patties smaller than the size of my palm, it was half that if any! I mean, it's called protein-style for a reason right? Kinda let down and talked myself into thinking I had a salad instead with a garnish of burger patty.  This location needs work or more QC. I love you In-N-Out, but not entirely thrilled with this one."}
{"text":"Missing California, it was almost instantaneous that In N Out would curb the homesickness.   Came here for a late dinner and got a hamburger, grilled onions, protein style and a drink. This is a my go-to order, upon eating I noticed that the burger had animal sauce which I think is weird because typically if you get a burger protein style you would leave out the animal sauce as a given. The sauce pretty much defeats the purpose of getting it protein style, so that kind of bugged me. I guess I'll just ask them specifically for no sauce next time. I like that they keep the spicy peppers for self-serving next to the ketchup dispensers.  Other than that, food came out quickly, service was quick, though it was pretty packed in the place for a late afternoon on a weekday."}
{"text":"in and out burger is an outstanding burger restaurant in US. they provide the fresh and delicious burgers with the lowest price. only $3.50 for a double double burger, it is unbelievable for a burger. the france fries are quite good. I love the animal fries that is really delicious with a special sauce on the top with smell cheese. definitely in and out is the best fast food restaurant ever. One thing needs to concern is that it's always been busy so be aware that you will need to wait a bit of time."}
{"text":"One of the top 5 things I miss about Las Vegas after having moved to the east coast is In-N-Out burger.  The drive through is incredibly efficient.  I have been there when it is 10-15 cars deep but I have never had to wait more than 10 min.  The employees are always very friendly and upbeat.  Then there is the actual food...I'm not a fast food fan AT ALL but this takes fast food to a whole new level!  Everything is very fresh and incredibly tasty.  I think In-N-Out is a particularly great choice to cure a hangover after a long night of partying in Vegas and you can't beat the prices, even in comparison to lower quality fast food joints."}
{"text":"Friendly worker here Sharon assisted me with various questions.   Got a bunch of stuff here.   Hats beanies backpack, shirts. sweats, Vegas In N Out branded gear, etc.  The store in Baldwin Park is 3 times bigger I was told, so I will heading over there sometime in the future to check it out.   She hooked us up with a free duffel bag and a  free pair of women's sweats because of purchases over $50-$60.   The beanie I bought here years ago was discontinued which I was disappointed but I bought 2 beanies that are the same colors but a different style.    I love wearing beanies by the way.   Nuff said."}
{"text":"Outstanding In N Out.  Staff was super friendly.   Burgers were delicious as were the fries and shakes.   Very helpful allergen menu online and staff was super helpful when he had a few questions and special requests.   A little challenging to get in and out of location so allow an extra couple minutes to find your way into the parking lot, it is worth it."}
{"text":"Animal style fries, no spread, with extra extra grilled onions is my favorite. We often remark how fresh everything is - and how wonderful the staff members are!   This location is in a slightly sketchy area...a lot of drive thru business but always enough seats for everyone inside. Less wait time for me to get my order!"}
{"text":"I've been introduced to In-N-Out Burger 5 years ago and have always been a fan ever since.  It's a fast food joint with a lot of freshly made ingredients.    You can see them actually cutting their potatoes into fries, as well as frying their burgers on the grill.  I always get the same thing:  Number 1, which is a double double meal.  Basically a double cheeseburger for really cheap.  It's packed with a couple of beef patties, thick onion slices, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles and their own spread.    Keep in mind, they also have a few items on their not-so-secret menu:  3x3, 4x4 (which means the amount of the hamburger patties and cheese slices.  They also have the protein style, no bun, and the grilled cheese sandwich.  Don't EVER forget the animal style option.  It's grilled onions with their special sauce!  This joint is only available in California, Nevada, Utah and Texas.  If you're in those states and those specific cities, definitely check them out.  You will be hooked!  Trust me :)"}
{"text":"WOW - In-N-Out finally opened on the strip!!!!  I'm from NYC, so I don't get to enjoy their wonderful experience very often. It was always a hassle in the past to get to one in Vegas but now it's as easy as walking down the strip.  I dinned here 3 times during my long weekend and it was packed each time. The good news is that the ordering line moves fast and waiting for your food is easy as you can watch the food from other orders pass you by and anticipate the greatness about to come your way.  Of course their food was wonderful as usual. A Double Double with fries and a vanilla shake. Why order anything else?? There is the usual seating and some outdoor seating as well. It is a bit limited during peak times but there are plenty of bench style seats just outside within the LINQ area.   During each of my visits, I was approached by an employee asking me how \"everything was\" as least once. On my third visit, I was approached 3 times and asked how my meal was and if I needed anything. This is unheard of in the fast food industry and I am very impressed. Did I also mention everything is reasonably priced? Especially for Vegas.  If you are on the strip and in the market for great fast food, do yourself a favor and experience In-N-Out Burger. I can only dream of them opening in NYC!!!!"}
{"text":"What can anyone say? This is the best burger I've ever had. When 25 of the worlds top chefs indulge in this this fast food mouth seduction and applaud it's exquisite taste, who are we to argue? The corporate culture is awesome and the love for this American icon runs deep. This location, like every other location I've ever visited is top notch. The employees are friendly, the prices are extremely reasonable and the food is excellent. Anthony Bourdain can be found professing his love for this true King of Burgers on the internet. Bourdain states \"This is the best meal in LA and it's the first and last place I eat at when I'm here!\""}
{"text":"Very clean and friendly staff. Try the animal style burger, it had pickles, sauté onions and extra spread. But stay away from the animal fries, for some reason all those toppings work in the burger but not so much on the fried, they were pretty gross."}
{"text":"Great location near the target as well which is a great place to stock up on supplies when you are visiting Vegas. Prices were cheaper than CA prices which was nice as well."}
{"text":"Definitely my fave innout.  It's always clean, and the staff are always welcoming, attentive, and helpful! They have never gotten my order wrong and I've been a customer since 2008  Their interior is like a cute diner that's red and white. They have a nice soda selection and they also offer milkshakes and pink lemonade (which is freaking awesome and not too too sweet) they also carry Dr Pepper instead of dr pibb yay!!!  My favorite is their double double protein style with grilled onions. This is my go to late night go to since they're usually opened until 1am! The prices here are also freaking awesome, under 10$ for a combo, leaving my wallet happy and my tummy full. I will definitely be back since I live down the street"}
{"text":"In-N-Out is a bitter sweet experience for me.  It's not quite as perfect (or guilt free) when I am not covered in salt water and worn out from surfing, but it still gets pretty close. We would make it here more than once every Vegas trip if they had a better location.  It is still quite a hike from Excalibur (which we also have to hike to because who would want to stay at Excalibur?) but worth every step.  Every burger chain that pops up and gets compared to In-N-Out tastes like white castle in a head to head."}
{"text":"This is the essence of growing up in Southern California and heading to the original Baldwin Park, Ca location was something we did often. It's nice to get a little bit of something from home. It's just good old Americana and I think a bit of that is part of it's appeal.   Definitely when it comes to a big chain, these are great burgers. I love that when there are a bunch of fast food that sold out to prepped preserve laden foods that In-N-Out is still keeping it real. Fresh, simple, hot food can go a long way.   I love a animal style double double but I sometimes also get it animal protein style (wrapped in lettuce) when I'm feeling something crisp. Can't beat some animal style fries and a shake too.   One random thing that I like is that In-N-Out pays their employees fairly and most people look content working there. I had a friend in highschool who loved his job there that he stayed all through college.   A big company that cares about their customers and their employees is always a place that I can get behind."}
{"text":"This is my favorite In-N-Out in Vegas.  All the others feel new and like any other fast food place, but this one feels like a good old fashion In-N-Out.  The burgers aren't any better or worst, but I just like the feel of this place."}
{"text":"ALWAYS A MUST IN VEGAS!!!!!! Get yourself a double double and some animal fries and your set!!!! Make sure you get the yellow peppers. They are a little spicy and fresh after every bite of the burger."}
{"text":"They gave me little yellow picked peppers in a packet with my order.  Mindblown.  Growing up in California and going to the original In-N-Out branch- you'd think I would know everything the \"secrets\".   Apparently not as this is my first pepper packet after 17 years.   This place was crazy packed when we went, but I had some friends from Seattle in town that really wanted to have some and this is the closest one to take them. I wish we took them to the Sahara branch because it was a bit of a clusterfuck. I'm sure for first timers though, seeing the famous burger with so many people gathering is a impressive thing. I got one a few blocks from home and had so many of these that the group excitement doesn't hit me.   Major kudos to the crew here as they churn out so many orders that these folks must be always tired after a shift."}
{"text":"Always a great burger.  They are hot, juicy and delicious.    They lost a star for having someone yelling order numbers over the intercom all lunch hour.  I've been here several times and never seen them do that.  It was annoyingly loud and distracting.  Oh well, the food is still fabulous."}
{"text":"easy to get to because it's a quick stop on the highway. it's a good, cheap meal on your way to Utah or elsewhere! The burgers are really awesome and so are the shakes! I used to go here to eat after high school to relax and it was always a fun spot to chill at. However, I do suggest that everyone pass on the cheese fries because they are just so-so and they should use a different cheese!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the big deal is about this place. I hear so many raved reviews from other people. On another note, I'm not gig on meat so I did not get it loaded as I've watched others order. The fries are terrible and I didn't see much of any other options on the menu. I probably would recommend to someone whose a burger lover, just not my thing. Nonetheless, I can say now I've had an, \"In and out burger.\""}
{"text":"Great meal!!  Loved my animal fries with my cheeseburger!!  Delicious chocolate milkshake!!  Just could of eat a bit if the fried as I ate all the cheeseburger!!  Super sweet girl who took order via the tablet in the drive thru!!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant for a burger. Very simple menu. Hard workers that are always smiling. Very clean  and organized. Always busy. They get you through the line quick and order to you promptly. Best shakes! Only con is where it's located has heavy traffic. It's hard to get in and out (no pun intended)."}
{"text":"I have not had a chance to eat a burger at In- Out since I lived in California! The burger is good, but as far as flavor goes I would take 5Guys or Shake Shack. The fries are excellent but you need to hurry and eat them before they cool down. Shake are also excellent."}
{"text":"Has to be one of the best burger joints I have been too.  The burgers are cooked fresh and if you are in the drive thru, you can actually watch the whole process.  It's hard to drive past, smell the aroma coming out of here and not stop to grab a double double lol"}
{"text":"Hard to drive past without smelling those grilled onions filling the air ..door is great prices are reasonable and the drive thru is always on it ..but tonight its all about not cooking  and watching some football"}
{"text":"In N Out really needs no reviews, the food says it all,  but this location out did itself,  opening weekend! We weren't there more then 15 mins and no mistakes! Service was amazing and food was amazing as always! So happy Surprise has an In N Out!"}
{"text":"What can be said about In and Out Burger?!! Its awesome and I wish they had them in Florida! This was the first place we went after landing and waiting what seemed like forever for our rental car. It is very crowded and it can be tough to find a table. Every table was full inside, so as my husband waited in line I stalked the tables. I finally got one, it was very dirty, which I had to clean myself but like I said its busy.   The service is great, they really work like a machine, everyone knows their job and knows what to do and does it efficiently and quick. We waited maybe 10 minutes for our food after ordering.   The burger was hot and delicious. They have this \"special\" sauce, I don't know what it is, but it was amazing! I don't like it on my burger, but I asked for it on the side, which they had no issues. It is great on fries. The fries were thin, perfect for me. They were hot and crispy. They didn't seem to have any salt on them, but I think that's good since some people need to watch the salt.   The prices are not bad at all. It was less than 20 for two burgers, two fries, a shake and large drink. I think its the west coast's version of McDonalds and boy it is a thousand times better! We will go every single time we are on that side of the US."}
{"text":"Even though this is the busiest In N Out location in Vegas, I have to say their service is pretty fast. We came here on a Friday to order through the drive thru. Our order was taken immediately and we waited about 7 minutes or so for over 9 cars who were in front of us! If that's not considered fast service idk what is!! The burgers and fries were delicious and when we asked for a nutrition facts sheet we were promptly handed one.   The food is a wonderful price, we ordered 5 burgers and 5 fries with 3 drinks and the total was somewhere around $24. It doesn't get better than that!   Of course, no complaints about In N Out. Not now...not ever. 10/10 would come back and recommend."}
{"text":"They don't have monkey  style... I have read about monkey style twice at this location, the first time they said they never heard of it  second time I was told that's not a real thing but I can add fries to my burger to make it. Well animal style is always good!!!! As In-N-Out is always amazing, never had a bad burger from here..."}
{"text":"Drive thru line wasn't bad tonight and they still had the attendant outside, that's a big +! So the line went by pretty fast. All the food is good as usual. Good to know they stay open later than the ones in my old bay area home. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Where can we start the burger was outstanding , I have had burgers from a lot of places and this is definitely in my top 3. This was also my first experience at this chain ,so I wanted to try it a few  more times to  get the experience."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients (you can taste it and see it) and made to order  Price is cheaper than other fast food  For less than $4.50, I got a double double + Fries (enough to be stuffed from)  Always get the Animal Style with your burger- you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I was in Las Vegas a few months ago and had to go to this location because a million and one people were at the other location on Dean Martin closer to the strip. Animal style fries are the best ever. I wish this was on the east coast.  It was during the EDC so I guess everyone woke up like 1Pm.  I enjoyed this location actually much better. Look forward to going back for the good stuff next time. This location is better, need a car though when closer to the Strip."}
{"text":"Oh man, I was looking forward to coming here again. Don't know what it is about this cow from california or whatever but shake shack had nothing on this one.  I ordered yes, from the NOT SO SECRET MENU.  Double Double Animal Style and Fries I want animal style too.  I loved every bite, I ate at alot of different places, but to me that night It was the equivalent of fine dining.  I had so much fun eating this, the fries tasted so good I could not believe it.  In a way I wish it would come to NY and east coast in general but also I look at this as something only some people should indulge in, haha.  It makes you look forward to your next trip to Arizona, Las Vegas, or California or anywhere else they have this.  Very affordable as well.  I think it was $7.05 for the combo and that is with the adjustments for the fixings.  My cousin went really buck wild and got the FOUR BY FOUR, so I got to witness him eating the four patties of beef right there on the bun and he actually tore through that burger.  Finished before I finished my fries or burger.  Kinda wish I had time to go back again to this location which is known as the most popular in Vegas (the wait time was actually not that long, maybe 20 mins at 8:15 at night on a monday) but nope ran out of time.  Was a total fat ass and had to take a cab back to civilization after walking the almost mile to get here then eating all that food, a walk back did not look pleasant, so a cab back to Tropicana for some walking around was in order."}
{"text":"Service with a smile. Double Double with onions and  animal style fries. What more can I say!?"}
{"text":"Honestly not everyone is an In-N-Out fan and that seriously makes me question their issue in life . Whats not to love about toasty buns topped with juicy beef and grilled onions . Every time I drive by you can smell the onions cooking and i always get my burger with extra ! If youre a vegetarian i heard they make good grilled cheese . Not me i come for the burgers and lemonade. Pink to be exact . Why do you ask ? It just tastes better and im a girl thats why . Im partial to the fries because honestly their not my favoite fries even tho they cut them right in the back and if you go though the drive thru you can see them making them most of the time . Speaking of drive thru I've never not seen a line because theyre always packed and im talking all locations because theyre obviously doing something right ! If youre feeling like you havent eaten in a few days you can order a 3x3 or 4x4 . thats way too much for me to handle but I've seen people do it . Its not pretty but hey go for it . Also dont forget to ask for spread on the side to dip your fries in . Its better then ketchup ;) . In-N-Out i love you and always will ."}
{"text":"If you're in your lunch break do not come here they will take up all your time leaving you not only no time to eat, but late back to work. Not only is it impossible to get in this parking lot the service is the slowest of all the locations I've been to. After waiting about 25 minutes for my order my order, it was still wrong but I had no time to let them remake it. I definitely will not be coming to this location again."}
{"text":"An excellent location that's not as busy as the others in Las Vegas but still fills up quickly at lunchtime.  They open at 10:30am so take advantage of an early lunch and beat the crowd.  The location offers plenty of parking and both inside/outside dining.  The employees were exceptional for a fast food restaurant but the food came out a little on the slow side considering there weren't many people here yet.  The dining room was clean as was the visible portion of the kitchen.  The bathroom was also very clean and sterile similar to any McDonald's restaurant you visit.  No paper towels for drying hands.  Hand blowers.  The food is good but we're not a fan of the fries.  Five Guys fries are better in our opinion.  The burgers are half the price of Five Guys and almost as good.  Our family of four ate lunch here for half the price of Five Guys.... $15."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this upon my trip to Vegas. It was on my to-do list and it was the last thing we ate before heading back to Chicago. Apparently, you're supposed to order a burger & fries in 'animal style' which isn't even on the menu. I mean, how dumb is that? You have a menu for a reason: so your customers can order something really good off of it and that 'really good' option isn't even offered on the menu? I was not impressed. The only reason I enjoyed it was because I was drunk for 3 days straight. Portillo's ALL DAY."}
{"text":"I was here for two visits. The first visit I did not know of the \"secret menu\" so I just had an order of fries which was super disappointing while I watched my husband eat the tastiest looking fast food burger. Thankfully I saw reviews for these secret menu items before coming back to the East Coast! We made a second visit on our way to the plane home and OH MY GOODNESS THIS WAS THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER TASTED!   I had a grilled cheese (which comes with lettuce, onions, tomato as well as their secret sauce) and we shared fries, animal style. Oh my goodness it was so delicious and lived up to the hype! My husband had a double-double, animal style and a black and white milkshake. Everything was amazing and neither of us had any complaints except the fact that we wished we had known about the secret menu on our first visit there! If we ever come back to the west coast we will be sure to stop again!"}
{"text":"I have never really been here before even though it's close to my house.  But I decided to go and ordered a regular cheeseburger and animal style fries.  Over all it was very yummy. I love the onions. The place was packed.   To me it's not a great cheeseburger, but yes it's fresh, yummy and I love the grilled onions.  The price is right and I'd definitely go back from time to time."}
{"text":"I love in n out and would give any place that serves their food 4 stars automatically! This in n out earns that extra star because of how easy it is to get through their line quickly. Maybe it's the location, maybe they're just fast, but I've only had one incident where I felt like I'd been in line too long. (Someone ahead of me spent 5 1/2 minutes ordering from staff who had walked to his car and at that point they should've just told him to fix himself.) can get crowded but nowhere near as crowded as in n outs I have been to in LA."}
{"text":"In N Out is AWESOME! But this location is insane. The temperature was incredibly humid and miserable. The speed of service is so slow compared to the other one over by UNLV. But the food is good. If you want a in n out fix, go to the one by UNLV!."}
{"text":"YES! I love this place! This is the best in n out in vegas for sure! The service is fast and the food is blissful! Every time I come to vegas I go to this In N Out and it is perfect!   Even with the high volumes they keep the speed of service at a good pace."}
{"text":"As an LA transplant I have a soft spot in my cold heart for In-N-Out.  The other chains (I'm especially looking at you, Five Guys) can suck In-N-Out's beef juices.  In-N-Out reigns supreme for best burger for your bucks.  It's no surprise Five Guys copied their restaurant decor & color-scheme, the \"our beef is never frozen\" tagline, our \"potatoes are cut in to fries in-house\" and so on."}
{"text":"Fries were gross (hard and tasteless), burger was just ok. Service was excellent or would have been a 1 star review. We will not be going back again."}
{"text":"I had never visited an In & Out Burger restaurant and wanted to know what all the hype was about.  So last night, my husband and I decided to try it.  My impression was it is a very clean restaurant with a whole lot of employees who seem to be incapable of performing their job easily or well.  There were so many people behind that counter, most of them just walking around or partnering with another employee.  It was almost overwhelming to see so many workers crammed into that kitchen.    The burger itself was okay, nothing special IMO.  I thought the bun was nice.  I asked for the burger itself to be cooked well, no pink.  Well, it wasn't.  It arrived medium well.  The special requests I made were followed except for the cooking temperature.  No fast food burger should be served pink unless requested.  Blech.  The fries that I have heard folks rave about were just awful for me.  Mine were served room temperature, barely warm.  Greasy, flavorless, and soggy.  Yuk and double yuk.    My granddaughter ordered a strawberry shake.  Something happened to the shake machine and they had a terrible time making that little cup of ice cream and milk for her.  When it was finally served, there was way too much strawberry sauce in the drink.  It was horrid.    I won't go back again because the food was not impressive and neither was the service, despite the many many people working.  The prices were very fair."}
{"text":"Burgers are always good, but the fries, while extremely fresh (you can watch them being cut from the potatoes), are not the best around. On today's visit, there was a misunderstanding between the cashier and myself as to the number of drinks ordered, which led to confusion regarding the how many we should get. We ordered four, two with our numbered meals and two extra, but only got two cups. It took a few minutes to sort it out, with the help of a manager, but we finally got all of our drinks. The rest of the dinner went well, with our food being delivered to our table rather than us going to pick it up at the counter, which is the norm."}
{"text":"Seriously? What can you say about In n Out? This location is consistently good and always has fast, friendly service. The restaurant is clean and the drive thru is easy to get in n out of.."}
{"text":"Jim the host is amazing. Such great customer service!  So friendly. A great addition to the delicious food."}
{"text":"Customer service is always good. Clean place.. Friendly staff and they are fast as they can be.. Really busy every time I go in but worth it. 4x4 animal style is the way to go. Also animal style French fries. Don't forget to ask for the special sauce on the side for the ultimate flavor ever."}
{"text":"It's all about execution, baby!  As an operations guy I really appreciate the execution I see at In & Out burger again and again.  Since moving to AZ I have made probably 15 total visits to In & Out burger spread over 5-6 locations.    Not once has there been the slightest mistake on my order.  Not once has an employee been anything less than polite and efficient.  While In & Out is not the greatest burger on earth it is pretty good and has been 100% consistent across locations and visits.  That's execution, baby.  Stark contrast to a local McDonald's where it has actually become an amusing stat for us to follow.  They have not gotten an order right for us.  Ever."}
{"text":"Best fast food burger so far.  Period.  Good shakes, better than the chalky things I haven't had for years from McKingBurgerDonald's.  Fresh cut fries that I thought were a bit odd in texture, sort of starchy-styrofoamy.  I find myself liking this place despite my resistance to chains."}
{"text":"This was my first In-N-Out Burger experience and I loved it. Their menu is simple and their prices are cheap. Their menu is so simplified that there's no small, medium, or large. It's just one size. There was a long line and the restaurant was almost packed. This was around 1pm on a Thursday.  We ordered a cheeseburger, fries, and a vanilla/chocolate mixed shake. The burgers are huge. I could barely fit it in my mouth. It comes with lettuce and tomato for only $2.45. It was delicious with their house sauce that they put on it, kind of like Thousand Island. They gave a generous portion of fries for $1.65. Their fries are crispy and not greasy at all. I seen them fry it in the fryer, but it's as if it was air fried. It's one of the best tasting fries out there. Their shakes are thick and creamy, not overly sweet for $2.20. The hubby and I were fighting over the fries and the shake the whole time we were in the rental car. We should have just gotten our own but I didn't know how good it was going to be. I thought that it was going to be your average fast food.  I saw people ordering fries topped with their house dressing, cheese, and grilled onions. I didn't see it on their menu. I asked around and come to find out that it's called Animal Fries. In-N-Out Burger has this secret menu where you get extra stuff on your food because their menu is so basic.  I wish they'd open a location in Hawaii. The prices would be more, I'm certain. I'd pay it though, because their food is really good."}
{"text":"Its In-N-Out..what else needs to be said.  When someone from a state that does not have In-N-Out comes into a town that has an In-N-Out-you stop and get a burger :)  Not much can be said.  Same great food and quality as the other in-n-outs that I am sure you are used to.  The only reason a 4 and not a 5 star is due to this location being usually very crowded due to location.  The location closer to the college is usually my go to spot!"}
{"text":"This is a very busy place.  Easy menu. I ordered the double and my wife the cheeseburger. Fries are average but the burgers are very good. Price is very reasonable and outside seating is nice to have on a sunny day to watch people."}
{"text":"Food came out fast considering it was busy. Parked near the drive through opening which was a big mistake but people let me out of the spot easily.   Sat with a friend and had lunch which was nice. Food was perfect as can be."}
{"text":"I came in for my usually #1 animal style. It was busy but my food came out as quick on a Saturday night (yes it's Thursday, forgot to do this day of).   Floors were dirty when I walked in but situation was resolved quickly after. A cashier saw the mess and jumped on it with another employee. Food was hot and fresh. Fries were ugh, so good.   Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Went here last night around 9:30pm. Wasn't that busy so it was nice to sit down with a fresh number one combo. Double double, fries and a drink. Lemonade and 7up.   Cashier and rest of the staff kept the restaurant clean. Sometimes it can be a chore getting into this location because you have to be going north on 83rd Avenue but it is what it is. Don't know why there can't be linking through to the other parking lots but that's another conversation.   Food tasted fresh, fries were hot. I forgot to order fries animal style as I always do. But even the plain fries have a deliciousness to them. It's always nice to find a place that makes them-fries-fresh as you're waiting. I waited about 4 minutes for my food which is typical.   I had a fun time sitting and playing on my phone while eating."}
{"text":"Had a great time. Ordered my usual one with cheese and fries animal style. Fast fresh and hot."}
{"text":"If you don't mind earing raw meat then this a great place... Nothing special here, unless you think a bunch of kids not paying attention is special... I was in last night and after discovering half the patty was raw, I politely asked the girl at the counter to let someone know as this could make someone sick... I proceeded to watch her for the next 15 min. and she did nothing. Plenty of other better places to go... Thank God for the ability to post this review...."}
{"text":"What a dissapointment today this had been one of the best location i had eaten at...but today they gave me a cold burger and overcooked fries...this is the second time we had the same experience and it was bad. I didnt enjoy my food at all they gave me my money back for one burger but i shoulve just returned everything. I ended up throwing up 5 min. Later...not coming back to this location...i dont know if its a change in management because looking at the employees they look confused and seem as if they dont know what theyre doing!! Oh well i guess i gotta find a better location."}
{"text":"Some things you never forget... your first kiss, your first car...  Your first In-N-Out experience...  That first time, I ordered the Double Double as-is, no substitutions or special orders.  I will always remember when I bit into that ooey-gooey burger with its melty cheese and crisp, cold lettuce.  Oddly enough, I didn't realize that it came with an onion on it...and in those days, I HATED onions... or so I thought.  When I took that first bite and realized I got a big honkin' onion chunk, I was immediately disgusted.  Then I continued to chew and - miracle of miracles! - I started to LIKE the onion!  Now my kitchen is full of 'em.  So I credit In-N-Out Burger for opening my eyes to the glory of the onion.  Onions may make your breath skunky, but they are delectable.    That was a few years ago, and I still make it a point to visit In-N-Out when I want to get my burger on.  This location has never made a mistake on my order... never.  I have evolved and now order my burger protein-style.  My fiancé does it right... animal style.  Heck yeah.    In-N-Out is good anytime, day or night.  It never fails to get my mouth watering."}
{"text":"The night I came through the drive-thru they were slammed, both inside and out. An employee came out with their mobile order system at 8:00 pm (I remembered them usually coming out during the day) the staff are always so amazing and the food....oh my god the food. I have literally dreamt of this place back in Florida where I now live. Fresh, hot, flavorful and just how I remember it tasting. They say if it ain't broke, don't fix it. This place is certainly \"ain't\" broke."}
{"text":"Love this location. Fast service. Friendly staff. Love the window they have so you can see employees making fries fresh from the actual potatoes. Great price for Freshly made food if your in a hurry"}
{"text":"As always In-N-Out does not dissapoint! This place has the best fast food burger there is. Better than McDonald's, Burger King, Carl's Jr., Jack in the box, Wendy's, etc. Animal style is the way to go for your burger! Their fries arnt any thing special, but the quality of the burger makes up for it. They also serve some tasty milky shakes made from real ice cream."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I have always heard amazing things about In-N-Out Burger, so I had very high expectations about how the food would taste. My husband had it two years ago and said it was delicious so this was definitely going to be one of our first meals when we arrived in Vegas.  The restaurant was fairly clean with the exception of the bathroom. It was pretty full when we got there, but the service was quick and efficient. We ordered our food and waited about 10 minutes for it. I ordered the single cheeseburger with animal style fries and my husband ordered the double.   The burger was good. I liked that it wasn't a super greasy burger and that the veggies tasted fresh. Their sauce is really good as well. I loved it actually. The fries are a whole other story. They were not good at all. The toppings helped a lot in making them edible, but the fries themselves were just awful. I don't know if they weren't cooked long enough or they were old or what have you, but they just weren't good. I only ate a few because I really couldn't eat them.   I might give another location a try, but I have had better burgers and definitely have had better fries."}
{"text":"Consistent with all the other in-n-out joints. Fast, efficient, and clean.  Animal style burger and well done fries. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Went here several times throughout our trip. Amazing and efficient service. Staff is friendly and food is amazing."}
{"text":"This is embarrassing to admit, but I felt like a 40 year old virgin walking into In-N-Out. I wanted to try the fries. \"There's only one size?\" I asked.  Yep. One size fits all.   So what made me do it? Was it peer pressure from friends?  Kind'a.  No, really I wanted to taste the fries. I imagined that an order of them would be better than other chain restaurants. INO's claim to fame is their fresh potatoes.  Fresh? O-kay...  To me, the fries tasted like cardboard. They did not chew like a freshly fried potato. Flat. Tasteless. Lacking all kinds of substance.    I was forced to doll them up. Throw some D's on 'em. But how? Haven't you heard of Animal Style? Ooooooh.  So I had a DIY breakthrough. Topped the fries with avocado, tossed some green onions in the mix   and   that burger spread though! Yes yes yes! https://youtu.be/B0mwKnE3qgU"}
{"text":"Woohoo....finally an In-N-Out Burger in our hood!  Burgers are what you would expect. Service is great and everyone smiles. Convenient location. Thanks for moving in guys."}
{"text":"Sitting in the drive-through waiting on my animal fries and vanilla shake. Service is fast and the food is very hot! I love in and out!! Sometimes the lines for the drive-through are exceptionally long although I would prefer to get out and go in at those times of the day.  Today I was in and out of the line within six minutes!!!"}
{"text":"I came into this place excited to try it out, I get my food but before that, the lady at the register was so rude with bad costumer service. Anyways the fries taste like wax they suck and the burger had absolutely no flavor, in all I was disappointed but the prices are good,"}
{"text":"4 stars for quality of the burger and service. Burger meat was fresh,tasty and light. Good place to grab a fast bite. Prices are good. I can say that this burger was  the one of the best fast food burgers out there."}
{"text":"Still best burger, get the fries animal style"}
{"text":"I mean it's in n out burger howwwwwwjxjsndba could you give it a bad review. Even if it's one of the busiest in n out's out there it's so worth it who even cares if you gotta wait that extra 10 min for your double double with fries and a lemonade with extra spread on the side. Okay I'm craving in n out now. Bye."}
{"text":"Came here before and got a burger that was s little to red for my liking, they fixed it so I was okay with that. Came here another time and told them to make the burger well done because of my previous issue, I get home and the burger is super pink in some spots so we go all the way back to tell them we ordered well done and it wasn't! They replaced it was super annoying to have to do all that when i asked for well done. Other then the burgers being red I havnt had any other issues"}
{"text":"Sooooo dam slow!!!! Seriously!!!! 30 min wait for a veggi burger n animal fries -_-    But it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Super packed and still pretty quick. Do I really need to do a review of this? Try a normal double double and if you dont like it... go somewhere else. You don't need to be waisting my time by standing in line in front of me."}
{"text":"The best thing about In & Out other than their burgers which I look forward to when I come to this establishment is their fries......what the hell happened here.   This In & Out in this location had the baddest tasting fries I've ever tasted.  It didn't at all taste how an In & Out fries is suppose to taste like. The burgers are still good though.  Things not on the menu that you can order is protein style burgers (lettuce substituting that buns) and animal style fries.  Very crowded location because it's across from UNLV.  Competition has opened next door, SMASH BURGER! I love that joint because I used to eat there every time I was in San Diego.  I'll give that a try next time I'm here.  For some reason though, I feel as California In & Outs have better tasting burgers and fries than the ones here in Vegas.  Maybe they need to retrain their cooks again on how to make it.  5 stars in Cali, 3 stars in Vegas."}
{"text":"Not too many choices on the menu, but because there is no in and out burger in Hawaii we always come! Food is okay, not a fan of animal fries...so that's probably why I'm not quite sure what the hype is about. All in all, not disappointed though when I'm craving fast food!"}
{"text":"They definitely get you in and out. This location is mobbed all the time. The burgers were thin but tasty with fresh lettuce and whatever that sauce is they put on it. Fresh rolls toasted to perfection. My first time.  Service is friendly. Their menu is limited but good for a quick bite! Double double cheese please!"}
{"text":"Three times in the past 5 years I've been out west on trips, and each time In N Out burger is a must for me.  When you don't get it on the east coast, you take advantage of the opportunity every time.    I came here twice on my recent trip.  Once on a lunch trip on my own, and once after my co-workers got jealous of me for going and demanded we go back as a group the following day.  OK, if you say so.    After visiting this location, I now know the joys of a 3X3.  Good God Almighty, that burger might kill you, but what a way to go!  Hell, there was so much cheese I was eating what was stuck onto the paper after finishing.    Plus, it's a minor thing, but I love fresh brewed iced tea, and the opportunity to pour it yourself when eating in will always go a long way with me.  It's the perfect combo with a burger like this for me.    I'll miss you, In N Out.  Until next time!"}
{"text":"Consistent as always In-N-Out!!! I was last here a couple of months ago. I lived there for 4 years, and this location was always well run and maintained.  Good food, In-N-Out standard of cleanliness, freshness, crispness, etc.  If I ate at this location or one of the many in CA, I couldn't tell the difference.  Great consistent experience In-N-Out Maryland Pkwy!"}
{"text":"I walked in inside it was relatively empty unlike the drive-thru which was very busy at the time. I was greeted by a friendly cashier who took my somewhat complicated order with patience and accuracy. I ordered a Cheeseburger protein style, a Neapolitan shake, and an order of fries (no salt). The order came in about 5 minutes which is pretty fast for an In-n-Out based on my previous experiences.  The shake was very good but I made the mistake of drinking it on the way home before I ate and I got pretty full by the time I got home. The protein style burger was sloppy and I've definitely had better in different locations. The fries were crisp and delicious as always. Overall great experienced and am satisfied with my order"}
{"text":"I so wish we had these out East. Every time I visit the West coast I make it a point to stop at In-N-Out, multiple times. This location seems to be just as awesome as the rest. Can't wait until our next vacation!"}
{"text":"LOVE In-N-Out and brought my boyfriend here last night for his first time. It was really busy but the employees working were really nice and so patient."}
{"text":"Getting here really sucks when you are staying on the strip and don't have a car. Walk down Tropicana on the side of the street Excalibur is on and eventually you will get there.  That being said, this is great stuff. It's pretty incredible how many people are in here at any given time. I got the double double animal style and it was very flavorful. Not your typical fast food burger when it comes to freshness and taste. Fries were really not bad at all, not sure why people complain so much about them.   Wish they would come to the east coast but ain't gonna happen."}
{"text":"My first visit to IN N OUT Burger was a success !!! Get the Double Double and Fries so good I stayed on the strip and wanted to try it, it was worth the cab ride"}
{"text":"The only thing better than a Double Double animal-style is taking that goodness home and adding crispy bacon to it. Good thing is right down the street."}
{"text":"Could quite possibly be one of the best chain burger places to exist! Everywhere I've tried these burgers the consistency of freshness of the ingredients and the flavors never fail.   I was fortunate enough to live right by the In-N-Out University in Baldwin Park, California and would constantly visit this location which I honestly think they maintained this location to the highest standard. Staff wad always fast and courteous, orders taken were always out in a timely manner and cleanliness is a must.   I've come to expect a good deal from this chain and never once have they failed me! Any location is a good one but for ne, this one is my favorite since it's so close to home."}
{"text":"This is a great chain, and this franchise is also great. The employees seem to be happy (or at least no where near miserable). The burgers are quite tasty. However, I think I like Shake Shack better. This particular franchise has quick service and clean tables. Also lots of parking."}
{"text":"Every time I go back to the West Coast, having In N Out burger is a MUST. This definitely satisfied my craving, but it wasn't as delicious as other In N Out burgers I've had. The burger could've been toasted just a tad bit longer, I think, to bring it up to 5 stars as it was a little too soft for me this time around."}
{"text":"I'm sure you know In-N-Out burger. In case you're new here, they are a fantastic limited-menu old fashioned fast food burger joint. The burgers are of a much better quality than your average fast food. The fries are made right there on location using fresh potatoes. The milk shakes are made with real ice cream. The employees are super courteous, clean and efficient. It's everything you could ask for in a fast food chain and then some. This location is right up there with the best of them."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at the Camelback location....it was dinner & a show. A variety of customers visit this location and they keep it very entertaining"}
{"text":"My first time ever at an In and Out Burger. We don't have them in the Midwest. All of my friends said I had to try it. I'm so glad I did. This was a great burger. What I miss for Chicago pizza and Italian beefs I definitely make up for in burgers here. I was delightfully surprised as to how good these little burgers and fries could be.   I'm kind of embarrassed to say I ate 2 double doubles by myself with a thing of fries and a vanilla shake. I was full to say the least and very happy. I will be heading back soon."}
{"text":"The quality control with this company is very good, the food is the same no matter where you go.  Don't let the long lines (inside and drive-thru) scare you.  The drive thru moves really quick.  If there are no tables open, drive next door to the company store where more tables and rest rooms are also available.  The company store sells all the t-shirts going back a number of years.  They also stock a number of logo items including jackets, hats, license plate frames.......you get the picture.  Exiting the parking lot can be tricky being that its located on a curve in a very busy area.  Try using the exit to the extreme north end of the lot, where your view of the traffic in both directions is a little better.  The food, if you are not familiar with their \"secret\" menu, try searching for it in Google.  Animal style with chopped chilis, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Still my hubbys favorite burger besides 5 guys. I don't eat burgers so this is a treat. Their burgers always fresh and basic but oh so good. I think hubby would go here once a week if this was out in the east coast. No joke ! Lol. So many people working and taking care of orders and drive through. Great and fast service a plus! Great fresh burger at unbeatable bargain ! $3.60 for a fresh delicious burger and $1.80 for fries are we back in the 1980s prices ?? Great bargain for delicious burger and fries!"}
{"text":"My first time experiencing In-N-Out Burger was in California.  After eating a burger, I felt like I engulfed 1lbs of pure grease.  Don't get me wrong, the burger was good but after I ate, there was a puddle of grease in my basket.  The next couple of hours I felt the grease pumping through my veins, making my stomach feel not to well.  After that experience I haven't been back.  I can admit that the fries are nice and crispy but not the best I have had.  Actually, maybe I should give them another shot.  Will I be valiant enough look at that artery clogging burger and eat it again?  Well I have to say trying it couple of more times.  They do have some really good burgers.  EVERYTHING IS FRESH!!"}
{"text":"If your from California you will be disappointed. Fries so bland burger so so. The strawberry shake was good but have nothing to compare it to . I've never had one from our local in n out."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is the bomb, fresh, never frozen burger & fries joint! Real ice cream shakes, fries that were still potatoes earlier that day, and Animal Style... Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Yes it's a fast food joint, but hot damn are their burgers fantastic. I tend to get plain cheeseburgers so you better have some juicy and good meat and this place delivers. However, I wasn't all that impressed with their fries. I mean, they aren't anywhere close to being as good as Portillo's fries, but then few places can match those fries.   Also, the place is clean. All gleaming white, the tables were spotless, and the bathrooms didn't give me crabs."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday around noon.  They were slammed (drive thru and inside)!  Well run establishment!  Approx. 15 workers in back doing an outstanding job getting orders taken and served.  Happy workers!    With the limited menu it was easy and so fast!  Good food.  Fresh.  Thin meat. Peppers were pleasant surprise.  Nice.  Fair price."}
{"text":"I like this place, great burgers but they don't have a list of options so you might miss something special. Ask at the counter for options like the monster way and see what's available. Skinny fries are not my thing BUT you can order them extra crispy any that's the way I like them."}
{"text":"IN-N-OUT IN MAH BELLY!  So freaking good it's almost criminal. Small menu here but what they do they do most excellently.  As we had a long ride up to Sedona today and needed to get some gas in the tank I noticed the sign on the highway for this In-N-Out location and made a bee-line for it after hitting the gas station. Did not want to get all bloated and sleepy by ordering off the \"secret menu\" so I went with the basic crave satisfying meal of a double double, fries, and a Neopolitan shake.  Good beejeezus this burger is like an orgasm in your mouth! Two beef patties of juicy goodness, fresh lettuce and tomato, crisp onion slices, and a soft buttery bun. Oh my! Decent enough fries and a thick delicious shake to wash it all down. Just ridiculously tasty!   This location itself is super clean with a cool retro look to it like back in the 1950's. A bunch of tables outside on a front patio that we ate on with the perfect weather out today. It just doesn't get any better then this!  That little devil on my shoulder kept taunting me to eat another burger, but I had to resist. Sedona was calling and it was a long ride. After this I already needed a nap!"}
{"text":"My inner Fattasaurous won out and dragged me to In-N-Out Burger pretty much as soon as I touched down in Vegas this past week!  After two months of hard dieting and working out I needed this indulgence. Nay, I wanted this. I had to have it. The beast within would not be denied.  So easy to get to by cab as it is close to the strip and they are pretty much running back and forth there every few minutes. Quick ride from Bally's and it was easy to grab one back as they are constantly dropping off in the parking lot. Even late at night it was bustling.  Protein style double double, animal style fries, neopolitan shake. Hellz yeah!  I sat down at a table with my feast and engorged my fat ass to my heart's delight! Yes, the guilt and dread after eating this made me hit the gym in the morning to burn off all the fatty calories.   Is it overhyped? Sure is, and it's not as good as many claim. Shake Shack in NYC is a better tasting burger. Still, you go for the freshly made food here and the ability to order off the not so secret menu which is part of the fun novelty of In-N-Out. That, and the diverse crowd that populates this place. The locals, tourists, and wackos alike make for some fun people watching."}
{"text":"Oh In N out, how I missed you so.  Your burgers are awesome, your fries not so great, and your shakes so yummy.  I had a cheeseburger with grilled onions, yum!    This location, the shake was so thick that it never melted during my entire meal, so I had to forefully suck it into my throat.  I still didn't get the whole bit of the shake :(."}
{"text":"Burger was great but fries were terrible. I had to ask for a replacement for my fries because it was like they didn't leave it in long enough and was warm at best. The replacement fries were the same. I ended up just eating the burger and throwing the fries away. First and last time at this place."}
{"text":"Just go here.....plain and simple..... if you like burgers. Anytime I can try an In & Out when I travel I usually do, and they are all great. Being from the East Coast, we didn't have I & O, so I cherish this place, and am excited to have 2 in the area. From a health standpoint, the food is fresh, but I wouldn't say this is something you should partake in everyday. The fries are made fresh for every order, and the burgers have this special sauce that is just oh so good. It is perfect for a late night binge after going out, be prepared to wait  in line, at almost anytime at both the  drive-thru or inside, both move quick, but your looking at a 5 to 10 minute wait time. I heard they have a secret menu, where you can order a veggie burger of sorts, plus other things off menu."}
{"text":"Not impressed. This is the first burger I ever ate that made me want to say \"where's the beef?\" I wasn't hungry so it's my fault for ordering what I ordered: The hamburger combo: burger, fries & drink for around $5.60. Cheap eats. Maybe that's part of the appeal.  I made a rookie mistake. Since I have never been to an In-Out before here is my advice for future newbies like me: Get the Double, Double. You might as well get it animal style too (grilled onions, spread & mustard seared into your patty.)   While I appreciated the abundance of veggies in my burger it completely lacked any flavor. My fries was also cold by the time I received my order. Like it was sitting out two minutes too long on the counter. I know because I was watching the prep action. It seems each worker is assigned to a station responsible for only one or two things. It appears whomever was responsible for getting the finished product out to the customer was sleeping on the job. SO my cold fries was not good which only made for a more disappointing experience.  Don't know if I would go back since there are other burger joints I would like to check out next time. Shake Shack & Five Guys is going on my to-do list.  Minus 1/2 star for the cold fries so my overall rating is 2 1/2 stars, generously rating up."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for drive thru right before the Bowling UYE.  I am used to waiting for In N Out, but this time it was pretty obnoxious.  And it was on a Monday night around 11pm... not prime time.  I waited at the first window to pay, but nobody was there.  Then someone finally said to pull up to the next window...when I got to that window, the guy had no idea which order was mine.  I had to tell him what I ordered, and then he gave me the bill.  Then almost forgot to give me my drink after I got all my food.  Consistency is usually great at In N Out...this time, the bread was over grilled, so it was crunchy.  Something petty to complain about, but since I have never complained at an In N Out before, I might as well do it now.  And they didn't give me a bag...only a square cardboard, so the food got cold fast.  I thought I remember getting it in bags on the way out?  Never order drive thru anymore, so maybe things have changed. :("}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with In-N-Out burger to begin with but this location was very nice. The young man who took our order was very friendly and helped us out with our purchase of four t-shirts, bearing with a little indecision on our end about which sizes we needed. Food came out hot & fresh of course. There is outdoor seating with umbrellas too. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I really don't have anything special to say about IN&OUT.   The burgers are better than any other drive through burger.   Also I like that I can get it protein style."}
{"text":"You could NEVER go wrong with In-N-Out. Whenever I am in the west coast I have to grab some tasty burgers from this joint! We stayed in Vegas for about a week and we went to this location twice and it was always packed! Even with how packed it was, the employees were GREAT with receiving and putting out orders. The pricing for this delicious burger is unbeatable. I just wish they would expand and come over to Florida!"}
{"text":"Great burger, value, and service  I'm one of those people who heard such amazing things about In-N-Out from friends who were acolytes that pretty much nothing could live up to the hype. And I heard it for YEARS.   Today, I hit In-N-Out for a great burger and an amazing price, even though it's not the religious experience some rank it as. Literally. For a few on my colleagues and friends, ordering a \"Double-Double\" is a straight-up analog for taking sacrament.  A few things I like about In-N-Out are that the chain keeps the food simply and yummers; the staff is almost always super fast and friendly (not like some chains that seem to hire anyone with a pulse); the store is kept clean;  and they get the orders right. OMFG on the latter item. It the core job of anyone in the service industry to create and accurate order, and yet, I can count the restaurants that do it well on two hands."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time... not only do I think this particular establishment is fun and hip, I think this company is one of the most amazing slices of americana...  At this place you can gaze upon the adjacent empty McDonald's parking lot. while this place is filled with hustle and bustle.  The food is classic In-n-Out... delicious and cheap!  Keep it up In-N-Out!"}
{"text":"I came from California to visit my girlfriend in Las Vegas and I decided to go here because I was craving some animal fries. I ordered 2 double-double and 2 animal fries to bring back to the hotel without checking the bag and as soon as I got into my room, then BAM! It was missing 1 animal fries. I didn't have my car with me so I didn't bother going back and they probably wouldn't give me my fries since I already stepped out of the door.  Moral of the story..  Always check your order if it's complete because you don't want any hassle. We ended up sharing just 1 of the animal fries, but overall the food was satisfying."}
{"text":"cant go wrong with a Double Double, fries, and a shake! Always good. Great service. I got some cold fries once, called the corporate office, they sent out some gift cards for our meals, then followed up with a thank you card as well. Not to mention they sent a coupon in a Xmas card that year. You"}
{"text":"The hype is real. Please come to Orlando In-N-Out burger? I got the double double cheeseburger with the animal style french fries with a vanilla milk shake. All I have to say is WOW. Everything was delicious. The only negative thing was the wait. The place was super busy, we were a party of 4 and waited nearly 20 minutes for our food. I only wish I could find In-N-Out on the East Coast. Will definitely go back whenever I fly west."}
{"text":"Ok, so far in my life and all of the burger joints I have been this was takes the cake. In and Out is a trifecta great taste, top of the line ingredients and amazing prices. When you walk in the door it is extremely clean and the staff are wearing the burger uniforms of olden days. Walking up to the counter you will find a menu with minimal choices but not bad choices. As you order you can visibly watch them fresh cut the fries and make your mouth watering burger. I lived in Arizona for two years and now the I'm back on the East Coast, I really wish we had them here!"}
{"text":"No matter how busy this place gets, they always seem to get food out at a respectable clip. Food is consistent and always tasty, and the staff is very well trained, to the point that I've talked about it later.  I've been going to this location for over a decade, and I've never had a bad experience. There have been a few times when it was so busy that I decided not to eat there, but that was because I was in a hurry. There's a reason why this location is always swamped, and nearby hamburger places are empty. Cheap+fast+tasty."}
{"text":"I love this location!  Not that I don't love every In-N-Out location!  The burger, shakes and fries never disappoint. The service is always with a smile; just going through the drive-through puts me in a better mood.  And I LOVE when there is a person standing outside to take my order instead of screaming into a microphone in a box. Yay!"}
{"text":"It's not \"In AND Out,\" it's \"In n Out.\" Try it. Rolls off the tongue a bit more pleasantly, eh?  OH MY GOD I LOVE THIS PLACE. They are always so friendly in the drive thru. They greet you with a sweet, \"Hello, how are you doing today?\" Not, \"WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY OUR NEW...\" to which I always respond, \"You know, I was thinking about it, but since you asked, no. I will never try your new....\"  So, anyway, first of all, they are so friendly. They always anticipate my needs. For example, I was asked if I wanted onion on the double-double I just ordered, and I said I was unsure because it was for a friend. He replied, \"That's okay, I'll just put it on the side for you.\"  So, friendliness ... oh, and they have never, EVER messed up my order. I always order my burgers with ketchup, mustard, pickles, and grilled onions, and that is always how I receive them. Oh, and we haven't even talked about the fries yet. In n Out fries are the bizzomb.  I very seldom get a hankerin' for a burger and fries, but when I do, this is where I go. I feel bad for all my friends in Chicago and Cinci, who have never experienced In n Out."}
{"text":"Great service, tasty burgers, fries and milkshakes.  My son and I had a great experience here."}
{"text":"My 2nd time at In-N-Out and it did not disappoint. I'm not a big \"burger\" person, but decided to get one (minus pickles, onions, and tomato). It was delish! I also got a small chocolate milkshake which was super good as well. Fortunately, it wasn't too crowded and we got our food fairly quickly. It's off the Las Vegas Strip but very close to it and easy to get to."}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 cuz the service was awful around 6:30 last night my girlfriend asked for Diet Coke 4 different times and still ended up with a regular coke, when we went to the window I told my gf to try and and she did and it was a regular coke than we asked for a diet and it looked like they didn't even switch cups and gave it back to my gf as ANOTHER regular coke sooooo"}
{"text":"This is my least favorite location within the 10 mile radius of my house. It's not bad, but it's just not my first choice and here's why:  A. It's ALWAYS busy. Always. They picked a great location right off of the 15, near The Cannery and kinda by Nellis, too. Even the drive through is poppin.  B. The quality IS lacking here. I understand they need to have a quick turnaround time, but for goodness sakes, leave the fries in that last minute. Soggy fries are gross and I almost took them back in today. This is a location where you need to request fries \"well done\" in order to have them done to an acceptable, regular fry.   C. Because of the amount of foot traffic, it is dirtier.  The only reason I stop at this one instead of the one up on North 5th is if it's more on the way to/from __________. Otherwise, I swerve on this location."}
{"text":"There are two In-N-Out's by us, this one and the one on Craig next to the new Cracker Barrel. Although we have visited both, this one is our go to, even if it is a bit of a farther drive. We have also been to the big, big location on Trop. In all honesty, we have visited an In-N-Out in every part of the valley at some point.  A typical order for our family is a No. 1 with grilled onion either with or without a shake, FOUR.... Yes, you read that correctly, 4 patties on the side, a fry well done and a small pink lemonade for the little man and for myself, a protein-style hamburger with grilled onion. I share fries with the Fry King (aka my son) if he is feeling gracious that day. Extra ketchup and spread, please!   They never skimp on the fries here. We really like that. I also like that I don't need to order my fries well done to avoid sogginess. Soggy fries are not welcome here- just ask the Fry King. In addition, this location has never messed up our strange-ish order. Their wait times, both inside and in the drive-thru are quite short, even when it does seem like there is a fairly long line. Also something we really like, as does the Fry King.  Check this location out. It's in a bit of an odd spot, but it is the best one in the area IMO."}
{"text":"This location is BUSY. Even during non-peak hours. It's very clean, the staff is courteous and attentive.   One thing that is definitely a no go with the Fry King are soggy fries. I took a chance and ordered them as is instead of well done like at other locations. I'm glad I didn't because otherwise they may have been too crispy. Add 3 meat patties on the side and a pink lemonade and we are good to go!  Our family friend ordered a cheeseburger with just spread. It came out just as ordered and was reported to be delicious- nothing unusual or unexpected from this location :) in a good way."}
{"text":"This In n Out is a busy location, but that doesn't stop them from having outstanding customer service. Nor does it change their attentiveness to orders. After coming here multiple times, different days and times of the week, it's safe to say that these guys and gals are on top of things here.  The fries have never been soggy and the burgers are cooked just right. They also offer T stickers when they see him in the back :)   No frills, just your good old, neighborhood In n Out."}
{"text":"Poor husband had to turn around and drive back for me after I realized my burger had cheese on it. We don't mix dairy and meat so there way no way I could eat this, and he asked for no cheese for sure because the other two burgers for him and no son didn't have any just move....so I gave it to the dog. :("}
{"text":"We visited In N Out on our way back into Phoenix. It was conveniently located right off the freeway. It was consistent with other In N Out experiences and was surprisingly not busy considering it was peak lunch hours. The food was good and hit the spot. 4 stars."}
{"text":"We came to In N Out during a lunch break. It wasn't overly busy. Our food came out quickly and was consistent with my other In N Out experiences. 4 stars."}
{"text":"I land in Arizona, it's dinner time, and I'm hungry - what to do? Go to In N Out, of course. Like most In N Out locations, it's conveniently visible from the freeway with the sign beckoning to come visit. It wasn't very busy which was surprising. It seemed like there are more In N Outs per square mile than I'm used to in California...so maybe that's why I felt like they were all unusually quiet. Alas, I wasn't going to complain - I was hungry and fewer people was a good thing! The food was good and for a brief time, I thought I was back home. 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"I don't have enough good things to say about In-N-Out, and maybe it's because we don't have one in Houston (for now). But I love the fresh tasting burgers and the fries. I always do my burger animal style also. If you have room, try one of their shakes with your burger, you won't be disappointed! If you want to be adventurous and you're new to In-N-Out, look up the secret menu online before you go so that you know what to order."}
{"text":"Get ready for a great burger served up juicy and fast.  Prices are very reasonable.  If there is a lineup, don't be put off, they know how to move folks through quickly."}
{"text":"By far the best fast food burger place in the  world. It's no wonder why this is the place everyone has to go when they come out west. Delicious burgers at a very fair price. And with a huge crowd at every location, they still manage to serve each persons order (made specifically for them) quickly."}
{"text":"My first time ever trying In-N-Out!   The location was minutes away from the strip and it was extremely busy! Right off the bat I was skeptical about staying and ordering but I knew I had to try it while in Vegas!   Customer service was far beyond anything I could have imagined! A little boy cried over dropping fries and the staff cleaned it up immediately and gave him some stickers! One employee held the door open for various customers and we received our order in a quick manner!   Location itself offers fast passed seating and great access to the restaurant! The restaurant itself was very clean and offered a great view with all the windows!   Burger was good but the fries... Now those were amazing!   By far an excellent experience!!"}
{"text":"I was reading in the Talk portion of Yelp about what people preferred to eat, In&Out Burger or Fat Burger.  Of course my preference has always been In&Out Burger because of the simplicity of the burger.  It's not fancy and has a whirlwind of grilled burger flavors.  Because of the topic at hand, I ended up craving for In&Out.  I chose this particular location because the line isn't ridiculously long like all the other locations.  I normally have to wait for a little more than a half hour before I get my food.  Here, it is what it's named, In and Out.  You're in to get your order, and out in no more than ten minutes.  I don't know how long this will last a people will more than likely catch on.  Service is efficient, and food is always cooked to perfection.  Fries can be sometimes too dry for my liking.  But, I prefer it over any other fries."}
{"text":"I used to like it service and food but day before I went got sick for two days, is such shame I don't think I will go again to in and out burger anymore"}
{"text":"Busy but fast service... Awesome burgers. Just wish I knew about the secret menu before I went. Fries just ok.  Thought we wouldn't get seats but everyone devours these burgers and moves on with their day. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and the burgers were really good.  While i can see the appeal i didn't quite see it as living up to all the hype i'd heard about it   Definitely the best fast food burger"}
{"text":"Great food, great service! The customer service makes the food taste better!!! The young kids they have working there are really respectful people. The service is fast, quick and always correct. I've never had a bad experience at any In-N-Out which shows you it's a company wide policy to treat the customer with respect, while offering a great product."}
{"text":"This is a great In n Out burger in Vegas.  They have the same typical burger but they have so much business that they are over staffed which bring you better, fresher and quicker food.   I've never had a bad experience here and I love the fact that it's got such a great view of the Las Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"I've been enjoying In N Out since I was a child and we could only have it when vacationing in California.  Now they are all over Las Vegas and this one in particular is one of the best.  It's clean, friendly and easy to get to for locals and tourists.    We got to enjoy this while coming down to the Linq to enjoy a ride on the High Roller.    We got regular cheeseburgers, a protein burger (wrapped in lettuce), fries, iced tea and a shake.    Yum!!!!!"}
{"text":"I remember when I was a child and couldn't have a In N Out burger and shake unless we were in California.  Now we have them all over Las Vegas.  This one is my favorite to go to.  They are quick even with the amount of people.  They are friendly and the food is always great.   Lean location with plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Gave this place on centennial and Ann a second chance. And it was still very disappointing. This location is awful cold burgers, to salty. Total quality is awful. Location in eastern is delicious go there."}
{"text":"Mmm, everyone working here acts like wound up robots. Yea sure, ask me again if I want cheese on my cheeseburger. I asked for a freakin' cheeseburger didn't I! The dining room always has crap on the floor and I hate slipping on lettuce. The Manager sets the uptight vibe here, so I'm sticking with Jack-In-The Box next door."}
{"text":"We don't have In n Out on the east coast so this place is definitely a stop while in Vegas.  Usually just get a 3x3 animal style, fries, and a strawberry shake. It's heaven.  I also like the location on Maryland near UNLV...it's a little more calmer than this one."}
{"text":"Burgers are just OK. The fries are horrible unless well salted.  Great service and atmosphere.  Kids love the place."}
{"text":"I moved here from California and am glad In-N-Out can be found in Vegas as well. Food is always delicious and staff is friendly. Oh the shakes, they're so good! And the fries are the best fries in the world, they never get old. It's a popular place though and is absolutely busy at lunch and dinner hours. Even so the wait time is usually within an acceptable range, the staff definitely runs around working hard to get us on our way. Do try to eat here since the food tends to get a little too cold for comfort if you get take out."}
{"text":"Just yes. Oh lord yes. I have friends that used to live on the west coast and they went on and on and on about In n out burger. I thought to myself that it's just fast food, and it couldn't be that good. I was horribly mistaken. It was fantastic! I had no idea about the \"secret menu\" but their regular burgers are symbols of perfection. We need one of these in Kentucky, like yesterday, you can have all my money if you make this happen."}
{"text":"It's taste better than shake shack for sure!  Even the fries is way better than shake shack! Again, wishing we had in-n-out burger in toronto :("}
{"text":"Its been a long time. And better left as a memory. Had the Double-Double Animal Style. Just another really average fast food burger. Maybe I know my food too well. One thing I know for sure. No more In-N-Out for me. This is big calories and fat grams. If I treat myself, it won't be for this stuff again. Period."}
{"text":"Best burgers of any fast food place!"}
{"text":"You never know what you got until you lose it.  I miss you In-N-Out.  If I could write you a poem and not come off crazy, I would.  I miss your cheeseburgers/Double Doubles.  I miss your Neapolitan milkshakes.  I damn miss your Animal Style fries.  Las Vegas In-N-Out, you were my last In-N-Out meal on my trek to the midwest."}
{"text":"I lived in L.A. For 21 years and for the latter half had an In & Out about three blocks away. I can count on both hands without going over how many times I actually ate there in the last 10 years (No pun intended, but the location made it very difficult to get in and out of...). It feels like I've eaten here every other week since I got here (I just recently got hip to actually using my Yelp account, so be cool). I love this place. My kids love it. My Girlfriend loves it. Even my dog Maximus loves it from time to time when he gets a treat.  This location is fast. Even when it's busy the line goes pretty quick and the food is always fresh, hot and perfect. The employees here are super friendly, and they work as a well oiled machine to keep those burgers, fries, shakes and drinks pumping out steadily. Now I mentioned perfect a sentence ago...in all the times I've been to this location, I've never had an order handed to me that was wrong, and that's saying something, considering the fact that there is protein style 3x3's, no cheese or sauce, animal style fries, and other specific craziness involved in my order. The bathrooms inside are clean, and they have a pretty decent sized dining area inside, as well as tables outside. This place is, in the words of M.C. Hammer, \"Too Legit to Quit\"!! One last thing...it's the only \"Fast Food\" burger place that I can eat a triple patty burger at where I'm not feeling like I'm gonna suffer through Montezuma's Revenge when I'm finished eating it.  Now go get some!!! :)"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love this place? Then they put one near my house! This is a fantastic new location and I look forward to it being here!"}
{"text":"The food was great as can be expected, but the service overall was unfriendly and not the usual for this chain. The dining area was wrecked, and we had to ask them to cleansome tables so that we had a clean one to sit at,."}
{"text":"The service is always friendly, and the food always good, but I find this location to have been extremely slow in the drive thru on my last 3 visits."}
{"text":"There was something off about this recent. None of the staff had a genuine smile or outgoing friendliness during the entire time we were eating in the location. I am a big fan of INNOUT and expected better service."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times and the service and meal has always been great. Even on this last visit, they undercooked my \"well done\" fries and they were promptly replaced. My only complaint with In-N-Out is that they seem to undercook and serve soggy fries unless you ask for well done.   Crispy is how fries are meant to be served, but not like potatoe chips.   This location can also be difficult to navigate in and out of. Centennial Center Blvd is difficult to cross and only one nearby drive allows for you to cross over to the south side."}
{"text":"A little slow in the drive thru... but excellent service, and friendly staff. French fries seem to be a problem at all these stores.... ts either soggy or overcooked.Wish they would focus on putting out  better golden crunchy fries. Asked for light well, and got potato chips!"}
{"text":"I have recently visited this location three times during the busy lunch rush. The service each time was impeccable. A positive management change must have occurred in recent months. The wait time is much shorter even during busy times, the service is quick and efficient, the light well fries were perfect all three times.  Great food and service."}
{"text":"Good service. Greeted upon entry by lovely young lady cleaning dining area. Quick service. Food was prepared to standard... Except fries. I hate soggy fries, I. Hate potatoe chips. I don't know what's happened at this chain in last few stores, but they cannot seem to get fries right with any consistency. I like golden brown crunchy fries."}
{"text":"Went with business associates after a meeting as the thing to do. The prices were very reasonable. The fries were freshly cut. The hamburger was all fresh. My shake was so thick I had to scoop it out with the straw!"}
{"text":"Burger was quite nummy.  Fries not so great.  Decent price.  Fast service.  Small dining area.  Great people watching."}
{"text":"I'm from North Carolina where there are no In-N-Out Burgers. People from the left side hype this place up. \"Can't wait to go home and stop by in and out\". I thought this was going to be comparable to Five Guys and I thought wrong. This was a McDonald'sesque burger quality establishment with maybe 25% more real beef in the burger than McD. Cute concept and decent service, but I was expecting so much more. Do not get suckered into thinking that this is something great. As a matter of fact, skip it. Sorry In-N-Out, you're a victim of high expectations that you didn't set."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy afternoon and the building was packed inside and outside on the patio (more than likely due to it being lunch time and spring training was near by). We probably got a number after ordering that was thirty numbers away from being called and we still got our food within 10-15 minutes. There was also a floor associate who was incredibly on top of cleaning tables the second someone left so some of the crowd could have a seat. Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"Good but not as good as I expected for the raves.  Super busy and not enough places for everyone to sit.  Decent prices.  Burger was good but they put too much \"salad\" on it for my taste, messy and falling out everywhere."}
{"text":"The food is soo!!! Good.  The double cheese burger meal with cheese fries and a vanilla shake is the absolute best! But then again I don't think I have ever had a bad experience at any in and out lol I think all in and out burgers are blessed....lol  Btw next time you dine there check out the bottom of your cup ;)"}
{"text":"Love me some in and out! Well sometimes when I get a chance to have some! This spot is the best! Great service and good food!"}
{"text":"1st time in an  In-N-Out ever. I've heard it talked up. I've heard it slandered. I went in expecting nothing more than to eat a burger -- but left happy I got to finally try this fast food institution.  Clean dining area,nice employees, and a short wait later resulted in my first ever double double and a root beer milkshake. Fries were stolen for my cheese-paper, and they were ok. My burger though?Super tasty and bursting forth with molten-lava-esque melted cheese. I love it when cheese does that on a burger, and I have to say I was very pleased with my lunch choice. My shake was good, but on the runny side. I preferred CW's neapolitan shake to mine.  It wasn't anything awesome, but In-N-Out is good grub,especially considering its fast food status and cheap as dirt price."}
{"text":"Bless this location TIMES A MILLION!! I've just had the biggest disappointment at the location off the 101 and Bell when they told me that their policy has changed and they will not put cheese in the middle of my animal fries (fries-cheese-fries-animal style spread) but YOU ALWAYS DO! Plus, you have NEVER messed up my order! Not even once. Thank you for the smiling faces, wonderful customer service, and bomb animal fries.   Can't stand in n out fries plain, sorry, but animal style is incredible"}
{"text":"I'll be sticking to basically any other location if In N Out.. I've been to this location a lot and while they have messed up my order a few times, I've looked past it..  but tonight I come through and ask for just animal fries with cheese in the middle (fries-cheese-fries-animal style spread) and they said that their policy \"has changed\"... I asked when and they said it has been a while. I was at an in n out two days ago and got it! It's not difficult? I don't want my fries to taste horrible after I eat the ones off the top! I hate their fries. Thank you downtown Phoenix in n outs for great customer service and never messing up my orders, you need to teach this one a lesson. I ended up walking out."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. I can't believe I've only just discovered In-N-Out recently on my first trip to Vegas. Now my review is only based on the burgers; the fries, to me, were just mediocre. However, the burgers are INSANELY delicious -- I mean, cooked to perfection and ridiculously flavorful for not being processed meat. We ate here 3 times on a four day stay in Nevada! This is easily the best fast food burger I have ever had the pleasure of eating. To top it off, the staff is super duper nice. Who opens early just because creepy tourists are waiting outside at the butt crack of dawn for a burger? In-N-Out employees, that's who. Ugh, if I hit the lotto, my first ticket is out west for another delicious burger."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a great in n out burger?! Love that they will accommodate allergies and fix any errors. Really it's splendid to take your non dairy non gluten kids out for a meal and know they are safe! Extra bonus for secret menu and clothes to show your in n out pride! Plus if you love secret sauce you can get extra on the side!"}
{"text":"All bun and no meat. The burgers are so bland and small. The shakes taste like all cheap fast food shakes and the fries, yes they are fresh potatoes but the texture makes them seem fake and they don't have any flavor. The menu is horrible and only has like 3 items on it. I understand that Californians love it because they grew up on it, but I can't understand the rage in other states. I keep trying to like them because they are really good to their employees, but I really dislike the food."}
{"text":"Came on a Monday.  The line was ridiculously long and out the door.  Wait time was 30-40 minutes.  So crazy how people would wait so long for this.  So glad I have one right across the street from my house, although I only eat here every 5 or so years lol  My friends and I ordered the animal style burger and fries.  I was never a fan of their fries.  To fresh and health for me.  The cheese on it sucked too.  Tasted like it was melted down rubber.  The burger was good though.  One burger was good enough for me but one of the guys ordered an extra one that nobody wanted to eat.  So I offered to help him eat it by eating half.  Oh man, I was so stuffed."}
{"text":"Even though the line was over twenty minutes of waiting in the drive-thru at about 10:00 PM, the burgers were the best ever!  Seriously, they were the best In-N-Out burgers my family has ever received at one of their restaurants.  We had to eat in our car, and that was okay!"}
{"text":"What can I say, In-N-Out Burger is delicious!   I went on Monday night pretty late and ordered the #2 animal style with a chocolate milk shake.   The burger tasted great, the vegetables seemed fresh and the animal style fried onions add a little extra kick.. My fries were also great and had just the right amount of salt. Finally, there is nothing like washing down a burger and fries with chocolate milkshake.   This is one great fast food joint."}
{"text":"Great burger but I am not sure why it is so cheap. We live in East coast so when we were visiting Las Vegas I suggested to my wife to have dinner here to understand what the whole fuss is about. Burgers are great and if I want to classify my burger ranking table it is something between Shake Shack and McDonalds. But I really couldn't figure out how they could keep the price so low. The pickled chilli is also amazing and goes well with the food. We visited In-n-Out twice and both times food was great and staff were polite so overall a great experience."}

{"text":"Love this location of in and out burger. Always fast service and yummy food. During busy hours they always have someone outside taking orders!"}
{"text":"This place SUCKS for drive thru on a Saturday it took forever... Dontt come here... The intercom was a piece of crap they could not hear the customer..."}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out Burger. I salivate over the Animal-Style double cheeseburger + fries and a diet soda. So bad for you, but so good. No, it isn't the best, meatiest, most original burger ever, and the fries are kind of soggy sometimes and forgettable, but all that is meaningless when you pull in, expecting to either stand around and cast a hawk-eye for any soon-to-be vacated seats in the crowded eatery, or resign yourself to consuming your greasy feast in your car, made that much better by In-N-Out's well-executed cardboard container trays.   I like the reputation of In-N-Out for being a good company, who treats it employees well and pays them decently. I like how this reputation seemingly trickles down to my actual experiences with the employees, who are always chipper and efficient (sans Chick-Fil-A's sometimes eerily robotic, hyper cheeriness). I like that the restaurant I frequent when I'm in Vegas always seems to be quite clean, and that the price is so reasonable for a luscious burger and fries with a drink ($7 and some change). I appreciate the nifty cardboard container trays that display your food neatly so you can consume on-the-go, in your car, or if necessary, standing up because there are no seats available. And goodness, that legendary \"Animal-style\" burger is so, so delicious: two thin, crispily-laced burger patties, cool crunchy pickles, melty hot cheese, grilled onions that manage not to reek, and richly fatty sauce, all sandwiched between two warm, soft but sturdy buttery/toasted buns. Add those little shoestring fries and an ice-cold Diet Coke and I am SO HAPPY. And, although the feast is a caloric bust, I don't feel gross and sickly like I do after eating at most other fast food chains.  SO good, I guess it is a good thing for my waistline that there isn't an In-N-Out in my residency."}
{"text":"Love you guys...got off the plane and came straight here.  Gosh, I know you are in Medford now, but you need to come to Portland, OR too.   Intel is in Hillsboro...a lot of those folks are from AZ.  Chick fil a has done amazing there.   Hurry.  We miss you protein style!!"}
{"text":"My friend who moved out to  Vegas has been RAVING about this burger joint. \"OMG you gotta try In-Out-Burger\". \"Its sooo good\".  I tell ya  the In-N-Out burgers are Really Really good. The burgers are really tasty. I like how i its loaded with leafy crispy lettuce and fresh onions. The burgers are on the small size. Their fries are crinkle cut.  During my stay in Vegas I had eaten here about 3 times. I was addicted.  There's no In-N-Out Burgers in New York or the east coast that I know of. The closet thing similar to it in my opinion would  would say is Shake Shack.  So to all my East Cost people if your on the West side- Do yourself a favor and try yourself some In-N-Out Burger and 4 get the Mickey D's and the Burger Kings."}
{"text":"Sikken en kø - der var en del ventetid, men som man siger, du kan kende de gode steder på længden af deres kø.  Havde undersøgt kædens menu på nettet og læst om den \"hemmelige menu\", havde også læst at en double double som regel ikke var nok... Check secret menu in-N-out burgers på nettet, der er mange combos.  Bestilte derfor 2 double double animal style (det er en booster) cheese fries extra chrisp og en chocolate Shake.  Normalt kan jeg godt gå til den, og der skal meget til at jeg levner mad... Men det skulle så vise sig at blive tilfældet i dag.  Måtte pakke den sidste double double og tage den med hjem - det var simpelthen for meget mad til mig på en frokost date.  Bestemt burgere som hører til i den bedste ende af skalaen, omend forekom den en smule mere salt end hvad jeg er vant til.  P.s. Opråberen (din mad er klar fyren) havde en fed attitude, briller og en nærved Ranger type stemmeføring, tomlerne op for det."}
{"text":"In my opinion, In N Out is the best fast food restaurant serving burgers, ever. Why? It's still fatty foods but has a more healthier process than McDonalds or BK. Employee's are super nice! And their food is affordable for combo meals.  Whenever I have late night cravings for burgers I hit up In N Out and get a cheeseburger combo with a coke, and a strawberry shake. I spend less than $10 including tax here for a combo + a milkshake. Whenever you go through the drive thru I love how they ask if you're eating in your car because they give you a mat and box to make it easier for you. Each time I came into an In N Out restaurant the place would always be clean and even when you watch them make food they look like they carry out proper sanitation procedures."}
{"text":"Being a Cali native and, having lived out of state for the past three-ish years I have been in serious pain due to separation anxiety. Look, a girl needs her Protein Style Double Double + Onion and Cheese Fry like she needs air, water, and shelter. I've been a worse person being without my fix.   That being said I was DELIGHTED when realizing that In-N-Out has ventured out from home base. Landing in Vegas for Thanksgiving I'll let you take one wild guess where my first meal was. Yup, this place.   Honestly, my order came out fine and in true In-N-Out style the employees were friendly and efficient but this place was packed at 2PM, and seeing all the employees working so hard when I know they should have been past lunch hour was simply impressive. Hats off to this team and the always delicious burgers I receive from the family-owned organization. Plus, bonus points for some of the most solid tomatoes I have had in a while, and to be coming from a fast food joint...  I miss you!!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday afternoon and the line was out the door. The people working behind the counter were very fast and got you through very quickly. I got the double cheeseburger and fries meal. I got it ANIMAL style, which has their special sauce, cheese and fried onions. It is not listed on the menu, but if you ask for it, they will fix it that way. My wife got the hamburger (animal) and fries. This is not just another fast food burger joint. The meat on the burger is top shelf and the lettuce, tomato,  pickle and condiments are all fresh and add to the over all satisfaction. The fries are fresh cut real potatoes, served hot and salted just right. If you have an opportunity to go to In-N-Out, don't pass it up. This place will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Shit's lit. Definitely get that double double. Why does the 7UP taste like froot loops? No complaints, just curious."}
{"text":"I don't get it. These burgers are grossly overrated. Secret menu, schmenu. Google it if you don't know what I'm talking about. The secret menu is like having their burgers your way. I do like their fries, however this location is busy and it takes time for food so there is a bit of a wait. Can that be said about all of their locations? Wasn't so in LA. ?!  All kinds of characters here, like the little 7 year old chiquita that loved ketchup so much she was willing to splat her face in it. How cute.   What is up with these burgers other than a plain thin patty, a butt load of lettuce and tomato and some salad dressing for sauce, that too it's not the tastiest sauce. Put some Big Mac sauce on it and that's tasty.   Snooze alert.  Burger boredom."}
{"text":"I'm from NY and this was my second time at an In-N-Out. The first time was in Cali about a year ago. I think it was too hyped up for me because I was expecting it to be amazing. The prices are very fair, but the food itself leaves something to be desired. It's edible, but not completely enjoyable. I got a double cheese burger with animal style fries. The burger is ooook. Both times I've had it, the patty was a bit overcooked and dry. The fries are the let down. They're always cold and a little stale almost. I was hoping the animal sauce would help, but it was also cold and overly salty. Being from NY, there's always comparison between Shake Shack and this place and I'd pay a little more for Shake Shack any day, but if you're looking for quick (if there's not a huge line/wait for seating and cheap, this does the job."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice. I don't get the devotion of folks to this chain. Yes, the burgers are delicious. However, the handmade, fresh fries have no flavor. The food takes a while to prepare. The restaurant is a bit stark."}
{"text":"Fell in love right when I saw the menu! Only 4 items to choose from; very convenient and fast! My boyfriend and I ordered #2, his with regular fries mines with ANIMAL style fries. It was to die for ;) Best burger joint I've ever been to. Definately beats Jack in the Box, Wendys, Burger King and McDonalds. If they had it in Hawaii, that'd be my number one fast food place I'd go to!"}
{"text":"What can i say about this place that you don't already know about? It's always clean, always busy because our entire neighborhood comes here everyday. And maybe the most impressive thing about this place besides the food and the customer service is that i haven't seen one person a day over 21 running the place"}
{"text":"In N Out!!    I love me some In N Out burger.  I've never had a bad experience at this location.  Drive through is pretty quick (for In N Out), cashiers are friendly.  The food is bomb.  I love the simple menu, and I love love LOVE the taste.  Give me a double double animal style protein style, and some animal fries, and I'm the happiest camper on the planet.    And the shakes?  Mmmmmm.   Good job In N Out!"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed with this particular visit. I ordered a double double animal style burger n fries. The burger was delicious as always, but my disappointment came when i found out the fries weren't fresh. For a place that's so busy and always wishing out fries w each order, i expected a fresh batch. It came out soggy. Other than that it was good.  I also got the milkshake. For $2, it was one of he best I've had. I was so glad to have tried it.   My advice.is to save some room for a milkshake or at least share one."}
{"text":"This is the closest In-N-Out to my house.. and I'm in love. It's never crowded, and the service is fast and flawless. The employees are always smiling, and the burgers are perfection. How they make such fresh delicious burgers so cheap is amazing. If I'm going for fast food, In-N-Out is always my first choice!"}
{"text":"I adore all IN-N-OUT, but I have to give a shout-out to this particular location..  My friends were drunk off their Zombies from Frankie's and requested we take them to In-n-Out for a \"snack\". Not wanting to ruin our dinner, my drunk friend requested that we have a double double, but cut into 4 pieces so make it easier for the 4 of us to share. The burger came out perfectly cut into 4 neat pieces. Fast food with great service.. I love it! The burger was incredible, obviously..."}
{"text":"Pretty fast and fresh even though this location seemed to be continuously busy. This was my 2nd time trying out In-N-Out and I liked it better this time around but it's still not number one. The fresh veggies and mustard grilled patties were good. However, the fries are terrible. In-N-Out has some of the freshest fries on the market but something's missing.   The customer service is great and they are open late so, if you need a late night snack (Flying Dutchman) or meal (quad double animal style), stop by."}
{"text":"After all the hype, especially that of Anthony Bourdain, I expected heaven between two buns. That unfortunately is not what I got. Cheeseburger was ok--nothing special. I prefer shake shack. Maybe I'm a food snob. But I didn't think there was anything extraordinary about the food. Even my fries were borderline soggy. Not crisp like McDonald's fries. Yes I compared in n out to mcdonalds!"}
{"text":"My subordinate Nick was the first to introduce me to this chain.  Since than we had came here a few more times.  Not a bad place at all, but not very great either.   This place is always packed during lunch time, but regardless service has always been decent and quick.  The place is well kept and clean, and the restroom is alright.  The parking sucks though, every time we come here we always almost get killed.   Their burger is pretty good, But nothing special.  And their fries are gross!  Even going animal can't save them.  I don't see how people can say their fries the best.  They are hard and dry! And I don't care if they cut them right there, their potatoes sucks.  McDonald's and Smash burger's fries are way better in every aspect.  Probably due to all the other stuff they do to it to make them consistent but oh wells.   Overall a decent fast food place.  Nothing really special at all.  I don't see why I wouldn't come back though!"}
{"text":"This location has never once got an order of mine wrong and it still impresses me. I just left this location and I had an amazing conversation with Janice. She came over and cleaned the table I was sitting at then we had a great 5 minute talk and it made my day. Great food and even better customer service. Thank you once again for setting the standard of quality."}
{"text":"I don't understand. It is not that fucking great. Give me White Castle.  So...I've given In-N-Out a fair shake. What is the hoopla all about?  I've never gone Animal Style. Is that what I'm missing?  Lines out the door and Midwesterners begging to have franchise rights.  On my most recent visit, the fries were kinda cold - very bland, no salt, just blah.  The burger not much better.  Thin patty in proportion to the bun.  Tasted more bread than meat.  Waited about 15 minutes on my most recent visit, and I have waited much longer in the past.  Always like....WHY??? I keep waiting for some magic that I just don't think is there.  Harold and Kumar went to White Castle for a reason.  Reason being that White Castle is like 100 times better than In-N-Out if you want to loosen your belt on the cheap.  That being said, if In-N-Out would like to grant franchise rights to someone in the Twin Cities - I am your guy.  Please, please, please. It may not be my cup of tea, but it would be like winning the lottery to own one. The cult has spoken, and they are hungry for In-N-Out.  I will delete this review and give the most glowing five star review you have ever seen in your life if you let me open up a franchise anywhere in the Midwest.  The ship is sailing....and it is gone like the wind.  P.S. Just joking Yelp...they are not coming here, anyways."}
{"text":"Exactly what you expect out of a burger joint. Greasy cheesy fries and burgers. You can get your burger \"protein style\" and they will put it in a lettuce wrap for you if you are looking for a healthier option!"}
{"text":"Dry meat. Nasty. No flavor. Did not order well done. Should have did it at home. French fries sucked. Always a line of 5 cars no less."}
{"text":"Very fast IN and Out burger.  We came right at lunch time and still did not wait more than 10 minutes for 3 meals.   We had the opportunity to enjoy the outdoor seating.  Shaded seats with the umbrellas and a nice day to be outside.   As for the food, great, fresh burgers and fries."}
{"text":"The burger was delicious. The animal style fries are the best fries in the world! I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"In and out burger is always great... This location did not let us down. Fast friendly service amazing food and is always the burgers are addictive."}
{"text":"I don't know how In-N-Out manages to consistently hire the nicest, friendliest and most attentive employees and yet somehow they manage to do so. I wish they could bottle up their greatness and pass it on to other fast food chains.... but I can't imagine how that would ever help their business model. Completely delicious and supremely fresh eats plus exceptionally friendly service!"}
{"text":"Love the double double animal style burger. Its a must when visiting. Also order there special sauce and apply extra to it. Also there animal style fries are a good side to go with them."}
{"text":"Curse me and my bad memory!!! For the life of me, I could not remember what the off-menu tasty order was! ANIMAL STYLE - it will forever burn in the back of my mind and I will have to venture back to In-N-Out Burger the next time I am on the West Coast so I can truly try the burger the right way!   I got a single and the BF got a double and we shared an order of fries.  For how cheap it was, less than $10 for our meal, it was a stand out burger, way better than McDonald's or any other similar fast food burger joint.  As a burger, it was not the greatest, albeit I know I need to update my review once I try it animal-style.    Regardless, I was so happy that we got to stop here on our way to the Hoover Dam.  Oh - the shakes are yummy! We got chocolate - Mmm mmm."}
{"text":"Always a safe bet for a quick greasy burger and fries. McDonalds and Burger King are lucky to still be in business with competition like this popping up everywhere."}
{"text":"For a fast food style burger these guys do pretty well. While I would much rather spend the time at Indulge Burger, David's, or Deluxe.. When time is of the essence I'll always pick this place over the ol' Mc-King-Taco-Box chains! What I like best is that they keep it real simple: \"You want a burger and fries, or a burger and fries?\""}
{"text":"This is probably the best drive-thru burger you can get anywhere. I usually hit IN-N-OUT when I'm in a rush and really hungry. Note: this location has a BRUTAL drive-thru line at peak mealtimes."}
{"text":"Their burgers are great but I've never been one to go out of my way for one. I get the double double with cheese protein AND animal style. YUM! Now, I normally wouldn't review a chain like this but I was so impressed the last time we went I had to share. There was 5 of us, all ordering something just SLIGHTLY different than anyone else, all different drinks and sizes, some combo meals some just the burger, some protein style others just animal or (like mine) both. It was a Thursday and the line was long. LONG. I mean like really lllllllllllooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnggggggggggg. It was almost as long as when the chain first came to AZ. But they kept it moving quickly and got our order PERFECT. I just wish they'd do something about their fries already!"}
{"text":"I FINALLY was able to try In-N-Out burger last night!!!! There is a new location in the Linq Promenade, located between the Linq and Flamingo hotels. It was exactly what I needed after about 7 hrs of traveling.  The Good: This is a popular place, but the line moved swiftly. The employee who took our order was very nice and happy!! It's a pleasant change from the sterotypical down-trodden fast food worker.  In order to get the real In-N-Out experience, you must google the secret menu. I ordered the Flying Dutchman with lettuce and tomato (a double cheeseburger minus the buns), Joe had a double double animal style (a double cheese burger with their sauce, onions, pickles), and an order of cheese fries lite well (fries cooked just a little longer so they are crisper with 2 slices of American cheese on top).  Oh my gosh, the food was so fresh and so delicious!!! Our meal costs $12.02. That is a STEAL for a meal for 2 in Vegas that isn't McDonald's!   Could improve:  Knowing you have to look up the secret menu for the full experience.... or else you are getting just a plain hamburger/cheeseburger.  Cleanliness in the dining area. It's not that the resturant was totally unclean, it's just that this resturant was hoppin' and there was a lot of foot traffic, and some people don't clean up after themselves. There were several employees running around and cleaning up, so they were definitley trying!  Also, some chili on those fries would have been tasty ;)   The bad: Nothing!!!   Overall: In-N-Out lived up to the hype for me, however I have learned to keep my expectations low when anything is hyped up.  I will most likely be getting food there again before I return to my In-N-Outless state if Wisconsin."}
{"text":"Top notch burger.  tasted like a bar burger or even better, but way cheaper."}
{"text":"Glad I still have a little piece of San Diego here in Phoenix. One of my favorite places to grab a animal style burger and well fries.   Love the simplicity of the menu and the spread is better than anything else you can put on a burger. The spread is great with fries too!"}
{"text":"Always good, always tasty, always fresh. Never have I ever appreciated In&Out more like i do now.  Use to come every blue moon to a near by In & Out, then as I moved cross country I realized how much I miss this place.  Never disappoints. Always good, fresh and so tasty.  It's almost always busy, so some wait is to be expected, however will be worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Yaaaaaas! Anytime you in Vegas/SoCal//AZ in&out is a must!  So good. Loads of yumminess in each bite. Double double, fries animal style and a coke... #HeavenOnEarth"}
{"text":"In-N-Out was everything I dreamed it would be! I like how the menu is very simple and not overwhelming. I had the #2 and devoured the whole meal. Hey, when you're on vacation, calories don't count, right? I loved the burger but the fries were meh. They don't cook them with salt so you have to salt them yourself. I wish Chicago had this chain, but I would probably have a fupa if that were the case."}
{"text":"This place was super busy when we went there, but they seemed to be getting through the line really fast.  Unfortunately, it took me 10-15 minutes to get my food even though all I ordered was a cheeseburger with no onions and animal style fries with no onions. People that ordered way after me that had huge complicated orders received their food before I did. So I was kind of put off by that right away.  Once I received my food (15 minutes after my friends had already gotten theirs), it was okay. I liked that all the ingredients were fresh, but I wasn't that impressed. It definitely did not live up to the high expectations people make this burger chain out to be."}
{"text":"I have to give this In-N-Out 1 less star than I'd like just because I've had better in Cali. Still, it IS an In-N-Out, and less than perfect is still way better than the other fast food competition. Other people in the area agree, the line out the door and the line for the drive-thru going out into the street and almost to the I-15 on ramp while the other fast food neighbors are pretty dead is telling: everyone loves In-N-Out, including famous chefs like Gordon Ramsay and Anthony Bourdain.  Except my ever hungry friend.  He wasn't impressed. He expected a large menu of every burger combination possible complete with foie gras and shittake mushrooms. Sorry, this isn't that sort of place. Here they keep it simple, honest, and fresh.  He didn't get it. It's not gourmet fanciness, it's just a good burger and freshly cut fries. If a place doesn't have dancing Asian midgets and a full appetizer menu on which he could order the whole page at a time it isn't for him. I can't blame him though, this location wasn't as good as I've had before, but it was close enough since we'll probably never see one of these on the east coast ever..  One thing to note, there's a company store that sells In-N-Out swag right next door. If you're a fan, go there."}
{"text":"Thank you In-N-Out Burgers as I will never need to go to Mcdonalds again! Best fast food burger I've ever had and I've eaten at all the fast foodies in and around Surprise. Only place I've ever been where the picture of the food actually looks like the food you get."}
{"text":"I don't know how they do it, but In-N-Out, no matter which location, stays packed. I'm a creature of habit so my order is always a #2 with extra extra raw onions. No worries, I always have mints on hand.   This location is on par with the others. Clean, quick, friendly service.   Great spot!"}
{"text":"Let's cut to the chase.  Awesome food and great customer service. Came here on vacation and was amazed at how quickly they got us served. Their special sauce was out of this world."}
{"text":"Alright, I had this for lunch instead of late night, with the same set of expectations     big mistake. I got the animal style burger and I've got to be honest, a Big Mac is much more satisfying."}
{"text":"I had their protein style burger. So happy to have found a place that offers this. Lettuces is fresh and crisp you can hear the crunch as you bite in."}
{"text":"Great, just wish they had better packaging. The food is great. Healthy and fresh I go to the gym so I need lots of protein and so I order the number 1 with fries."}
{"text":"Take a long time for the drive thru. Hopefully they improve. But food is great burger is go and fries is fresh."}
{"text":"In-N-Out's unspoken rule is that it's going to be a little bit between when you arrive and when you get your meal.  That's the sweet price of success and deliciousness.  And if you do the drive-thru service, it's going to be probably 10 minutes.    But this location is murderously slow to one's lunch break!  I had three cars in front of me and it took 27 minutes from arrival to getting my order and leaving.  It wasn't anything off the secret menu, just a Double-Double combo.  But even when it was my turn at the window, it seemed lagged.    How I love a tasty burger at these restaurants, but how slow this place is."}
{"text":"This is the place if you want a delicious fast food burger!  I pity the constantly abandoned Arby's 20 yards away.  That Arby's is all, \"Dang, why are you so delicious In 'n' Out, with your simple, yet always deliciously diverse menu?  Look at us, suffering and empty here.\"  Even the wait times are lower than in California at this location!"}
{"text":"I don't get this place. The burgers are super greasy with no flavor even if you order them animal style   the fries were horrible. And we couldn't all sit at the same table. This was my second visit needless to say I wont be going back. I just dont get the hype go to Carl's Jr much better food"}
{"text":"Reese is the man. Fast service on late addition to my order !  I had totally forgotten to add a cheeseburger to my order and had to go wait in line to make the addition to my order. With an already packed drive through line and a full house inside, Reese made the extra effort to expedite my late order so it was ready by the time the rest of my previously ordered food was.  This enabled me to get my food all together and get out of there in a timely manner !"}
{"text":"Always a favorite and usually for less than $5. In N Out is what a hamburger is all about. Definitely always fresh, friendly staff, not the best parking lot or drive thru access, but that's not important when it comes satisfying an In N Out craving."}
{"text":"Um duh! In and out. Cooked fast and prepped perfectly! Customer service was friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Service is great and fast. Food is awesome. I prefer my burgers with grilled onions. When you drive by and see a long line, don't let that deter you as the line, both inside and at the drive through move quickly."}
{"text":"Typical In-N-Out with friendly employees, fresh food and clean dining area. Double-Double with grilled onions is my favorite. Potatoes are peeled in house which make the fries fresh. Drive though here is busy a lot of the day but moves at a good pace."}
{"text":"This place is right off the I-10 and it can get extremely busy! Surprisingly, the line moves quickly. The food is fresh and delicious. The Double-Double is my favorite item. I recommend you add grilled onions to your burger."}
{"text":"This place is heaven. I usually stick to the drive thru. Always somewhat of a wait but it's made fresh and is one of the best burgers in town. All the staff are friendly and greet you with a smile. Can get pretty busy at night so be ready."}
{"text":"I guess i just dont get this place.  Sure, its a burger place, but I just dont get why people give it such high ratings... theres just not much to it.  They dont even have mayo... I mean really?   Look, the food is good, and the staff is friendly.  I would eat here again."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to go get some cheap burgers. Although you may have to wait up to 20 mins for your food, you really cant beat the freshness and the quality of the food! I love to get the hamburger animal style with lots of lettuce and banana peppers... YUMMM"}
{"text":"The undisputed leader of fast hamburger joints; they are giants of chopped meat cuisine and haute fashion (they have an impressive array of t-shirts and other garments/ accessories for sale).  Why don't they come to New York City?  I'll have a double double with cheese. Wait, make that 7 double doubles with cheese. And one of your new design t-shirts (of course you know that I wear an X-Large)."}
{"text":"I will give 5 stars if their french fries taste better than fried cardboard. Their burgers are good with fresh lettuce and tomato, better than Burger King, McDonalds and Jack in a box. I sent my comment about french fries but I suppose they are not gonna make better fries. I wish they would use russet or yukon gold."}
{"text":"Love love love In-N-Out. My Hoosier childhood was devoid of this amazing institution since they will never open one east of the Mississippi River. For many moons I have tried to make time to visit one in the Valley during my Phoenix visits, and only until recently was able to dine in. Everyone and their mother knows about the \"secret menu\" and their \"not so secret menu\". So of course, I did my homework and knew what I wanted beforehand. Had I not been dying of hunger, I would've done more damage to the wallet [like order a shake, a root beer float, another side of Animal Style fries]. The cashiers were thoroughly amused at my menu knowledge despite my Mid-western roots. One cheeseburger with everything+ whole grilled onion and cut in half with Animal Style fries to share with my mom. Although my burger did not get halved, it still was tasty. The fries were out of this world. The place is just fan-friggin-tastic."}
{"text":"I ordered a double double plain through the drive thru and confirmed with the person taking the order that it was just meat and bun. When I got back to where I was going to eat lunch, it had cheese on it. So I drove all the way back and I went inside and told them what had happened, it was no big deal. The problem was with the employee that kept making the situation my fault. I think her name was Patricia. It was supposed to be a quick exchange, but instead I was treated rudely and made to seem that I had done something wrong in front of everyone in the restaurant. Not my favorite interaction here."}
{"text":"I was feeling out of the ordinary, so I went to In-N-Out. Long drive thru line. My plain cheeseburger was on the dry side. The bun and the patty tasted dry. I've never been a fan of their fries (the oil tastes weird), but they were actually okay. Overall, not an impressive visit."}
{"text":"It's true. Whenever I try a place that's hailed as the greatest thing in its genre, I'm disappointed about 75% of the time. I'm happy to say that In-n-Out was worth the time I've spent listening to the countless tales of its ultra-juicy, delicious, \"best burgers ever\" and I can confirm that it lives up to its title.  We were staying at Mandalay Bay and ended up getting on the bus headed the wrong way. Lucky for us though, we realized it right away so we were planning to get off and hitch the bus going the other way, when we saw a giant sign that said In-n-Out burgers 1/2 mile down Maryland. Somehow our slight detour fared better for us because I've heard about how busy the Dean Martin one is and the one we went to by UNLV only had a few people there. Score!  I had been practicing what I was going to order from the Secret Menu so I didn't go in there looking like a newbie. I had it down pat. Two double doubles, animal style and an order of well done animal style fries. BOOM! It looked like I'd done this before. I'd read a lot of reviews about how the fries were nasty, but they were pretty good smothered in thousand island, onions and cheese AND cooked extra crispy. Not bad at all.   The burgers were the true winner though. I want to overnight ship about 100 of those back home so everyone I know can experience this. This may sound dumb, but the cheese they use on their burgers is not the traditional Kraft cheese. Oh no, this was some extra tasty cheese-- no offense, Kraft. The burger, well you could tell that it was fresh and not frozen. It was very melt-in-your-mouth good.   I hope I can make it back before returning home so I can experience fast food goodness one more time around."}
{"text":"My favorite In-N-Out location!  Staff is friendly and the restaurant dining area is clean.  It's does have a smaller dining area compared to the ones in California, but the food makes up for it.  Food comes out in room temperature...it's the standard In-N-Out food so expect the same.  There is plenty of parking outside.  I have never gone through the drive thru so I can't comment on that portion of the service."}
{"text":"These guys rock! We love getting our burger fix here. The staff is friendly and they all work together to get your food out fast. Wish a manager would have came out to break up this photo shoot though...the place was packed and many people were standing around looking for a place to sit."}
{"text":"No matter where you go in the World if you are wearing an in and out shirt or hat some big guy usually yells out \"In and Out Man I love that place\" I think that says it all."}
{"text":"Location & Aesthetics - Located in Peoria on the corner a somewhat large intersection though it stands apart from other stores within that area such as the JC Penny Home Store.  Therefore with that being said, be careful when you take the entrance for the JC Penny Home Store thinking you'll get to In-N-Out Burger because the restaurant has its own entrance and exit.   There's tables and chairs outside for dining purposes with misters if that's your thing or you can dine inside though when we went, inside was a bit crowded as it was a Friday night.  The restaurant was clean and there's always staff going around cleaning up the floors and tables.  Some in my party thought the place had a 50's look to it reminiscent of Freddy's Frozen Custard but I didn't get that feeling.   Parking can be a little difficult to find on a busy night like Friday as parking is somewhat limited to their parking lot which seemed small in size.  If you're doing the drive-through be prepared for a long line as we witnessed. (-1)  Menu - The menu is very simple - double double, cheeseburger, or hamburger.  Then there's fries, shakes, or beverages.  I have to say that I am really a fan of this concept of simple menus!  With that being said, we still had to step aside as there was one in my party who couldn't decide what they wanted.    Service - The staff was spectacularly nice and friendly!    Food - I ordered the double-double meal and substituted my drink for a strawberry shake. The burger was divine!  Juicy and mouthwatering with fresh lettuce, tomato, and of course American cheese which was dripping over the sides...my oh my oh my!  The french fries was fresh and lightly salted and tastes as if they just went out and picked the spuds, cut it up and put it right in the fryer!  The shake tasted like it was from real ice-cream - creamy and smooth, and most of which was consumed by someone in my party who, once they got a taste of it, couldn't put it down.  Suffice it to say, I was only left with a quarter of it to drink despite repeatedly offering to buy them one...that's how good the shake was!  Definitely will be coming back here for more!"}
{"text":"Typically I avoid fast food restaurants due to severe food allergies. Today when I was in I had a fantastic cashier who highlighted to the manager my gluten and tomato allergy to make sure that I wouldn't get sick. It is wonderful to see a fast food joint who cares about their special customers."}
{"text":"I remember vividly when I first tried In-N-Out in 2011 and how I addictively stopped more than once before, during, and after a road trip between Las Vegas, San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. The burgers (and animal fries!) were soo good that I made the West Coast staple my first food stop on a trip this January. Oh, how the mighty have fallen. The food is still decent, especially at its price point, but its not something I'm looking forward to on future trips.  The bun tasted stale. What happened to that buttery toasty yet soft carb pillow from before? The tomatoes tasted old like they were overripen ...from a few days ago. I could barely taste the burger as if there was no seasoning and the meat wasn't fresh - did my taste buds not make it through customs? The fries were soggy, stale, and lacked seasoning. The ONLY redeeming thing about the food was the animal style. If I could order a burger and fries animal-style hold the burger and fries, I would.  I crossed my fingers and hoped this was a one off (or maybe one location) experience but tried two more locations and had the exact same experience. Someone messed with In-N-Out's magic and I want answers."}
{"text":"It's In N Out, what more can I say.  We are always pleased to find these joints when heading out west since they are nowhere to be found on the East Coast.   We went in around 1115 on a weekday thinking 1. people wouldn't be awake yet, or 2. it was too early for lunch. Boy were we wrong on both accounts. It was packed, but the line moved quickly. Soon it became a \"who is quicker\" competition for trying to find a table. For the amount of customers they get, they sure need more seating when the weather isn't that nice outside. Luckily we found a table quickly and our food arrived shortly after (maybe 10 minutes or less).  The burgers were delicious with the grilled onions and special sauce. The fries were a bit cold and stale so I think we would have rather gotten bigger burgers and passed on the fries. The milkshake was super thick to drink through a straw. Walking around with it, the consistency thinned out and we were able to enjoy them.   NOTE: There are no bathrooms at this location.  (When walking by later at night it wasn't super crowded, might be better for a cheap dinner if you don't want to wait.)"}
{"text":"I am so happy that Las Vegas has In N Out Burger!! After moving here from California, Las Vegas would seem incomplete without it.   Every time I go, I have great service with fast, fresh, and delicious food! It is my all time favorite burger joint!"}
{"text":"$3.60 for a double double.   Mmmmmmmmm.  Living in NYC, how I missed you so!   Legendary burgers, still reasonable prices and service was fairly quick considering the mob scene inside.  Love this place."}
{"text":"This establishment is a perfect description of the people that come to this city.....  \"In-N-Out......  Animal Style\""}
{"text":"Hey, it's In-N-Out Burger. What more do you need to say. If you're west of the Mississippi, you should stop in and give it a try. The burgers a fine. The fries a good. The lines are LONG. I don't know why. It's not that good, but I do like it. Pretty basic menu. This location is across from the Linq hotel about 150 yards off the strip. I ate here around 5:30 pm. I'd say late night the lines are stupid long."}
{"text":"You know not all In N' Out burgers are created equal, and these guys seem to still be figuring it out.  I got stuff to go and the animal style fries should never be taken to go, but for sure not from this location. while I was standing waiting for my food I saw like 3 people come up with cold fries or incorrect orders.  The place was packed at 1am, at 10pm it is totally a zoon. There is another only 3 miles away, would be worthwhile to go there instead to avoid this crazy crowd.  The double double was as good as usual, fries were cold, greasy and bad."}
{"text":"This is my favorite of any fast food restaurants! The only bad thing is the immense drive through lines, as well as inside, but even then it surprisingly goes fast! The reason the lines are so long is is because the food is amazing! Especially an animal style burger, cheese fries and neapolitan shake. Out of the million of times I've eaten there, I've only gotten my order wrong once or twice! The workers are really nice as well and efficient."}
{"text":"I always make an effort to come here when I'm in Vegas! What's not to love about this place! This time around I got a number one, but animal styled everything! I got my usual pink lemonade as well! Don't know why, but their pink lemonade is so much better than every where else! Maybe because it's not super sweet! My burger and fries animal style was AMAZING! The only issue I had was that I wish I could've eaten more! In-N-Out never disappoints! Hope to come back soon! :)"}
{"text":"Very overrrated burger chain. Fries were mediocre. Burgers were average at best. This place is not worth the hype. Culver's and Five Guys burgers and fries blow this place out of the water."}
{"text":"Best burgers on the west coast hands down. I still can't believe it's cheaper than Starbucks coffee for such a high quality meal. In N Out is always my go-to because I know I'll feel great after eating here. Love my burger \"animal style\""}
{"text":"You might consider just getting your food to go. Unless you like to eat while homeless people stare at you and grunt like a dying walrus. Or if you enjoy listing to children test out every chair to see if it will make a high pitched screeching noise when sat on and spun back and forth - while employees walk by and say nothing."}
{"text":"I cant believe it. An In-N-Out only 3 miles from my place. This is bad... Very bad...  This place just opened... and it showed. Well, in a good way I mean. I drive by and the dining room seems empty. Its a Friday night around 10pm and I figure this place would be somewhat busy.  I roll into the drive through and there outside in the freezing weather stands a girl taking orders. I wonder if she drew the short straw that evening or just normally out there. She proceeds to take my order and I drive up to the cashier window. The cashier then proceeds to confirm my full order. Finally I pull up to pick up window and my food near ready. A brief 2 minute wait and our food is ready to go.   Here's a list of what we ordered:  - Cheeseburger, Protein style. - Cheeseburger, Animal style add a slice of raw onion.  - Fries, Animal style - Regular fries - Chocolate Shake  When we arrived back at the house, the food was perfectly prepared and everything was in order. Needless to say, the food here is great and the prices are reasonable.  On a side note: While I was waiting, I did notice they had a lot of workers standing around waiting to make food... The problem is that it was slow so there was no orders to make!  Of course, pictures included!!"}
{"text":"WAS one of my favorite drive-thru's but today picked up a Burger and could barley find the patty, what's happened??? Chick-fil-a is right next door and the cars were 20 deep and only a few a In-N-Out  wonder if others have noticed this.  The meat patty was thinnest of any burger place.   Come on!!!  In-N-Out don't mess up a good thing."}
{"text":"I really don't understand why it's so hard for them to take a correct order. I ordered a double cheeseburger animal style with extra grilled onions added green chilies protein style.   When I got to the window and the repeated the order they forgot to add the extra grilled onions so they said that they would remake it. When they repeated the order back to me this time it was correct.   However when I got home to eat my delicious cheeseburger I was very disappointed to find that there were no added green chilies / banana peppers. How is it that you fucked up my order twice.   I LOVE IN AND OUT . But it it seems that your employees lack of capability I'm making correct orders. With smash burger right across the street I guess that's going to be my new spot. They have never messed my order up there."}
{"text":"Picture speaks for itself. Being from the Midwest, I grab In-N-Out every chance I can get!"}
{"text":"First time here and I must say I am very upset that we don't have one in Michigan!! The food was very good and filling. I ordered the double double and animal style fries which was Amazing to say the least! If I ever see one again I will definitely stop!"}
{"text":"This must be my 43rd different location of in-n-out, so I consider myself an aficionado. I got double the salt on my double double. But seriously folks, I will not be doubling back to this location. In and staying Out!"}
{"text":"Who doesnt love in and out! This one is just as good as the others in regards to the quality but the only knock is the crazy long lines and the stupid hot vegas air hahah But this in and out is very good! As expected!!"}
{"text":"As someone who came out to ASU from the Midwest, I have to admit that one of my favorite things in Tempe is the In N Out by the 202.  Before I came out here, everyone I had talked to from the West Coast raved about In N Out burger and they hype is well deserved.    In N Out is fast food, but its the most fresh and flavorful burger I have ever had, and for some reason, even the bun tastes better than at most places.  And for anyone totally new to the place, order Animal Style on your burger, you'll definitely be glad you did."}
{"text":"I have been going to this In-N-Out location pretty much since opening day. Well, that's not exactly true ... I was the one in the tent across the parking lot while they were building the place, drooling and stomach growling waiting for my chance to devour an In-N-Out handful of nirvana (so, yeah, that's not true either).  But it is true that I was one of those people who used to wait in the long lines at the SoCal locations when they first started to expand from the original restaurants. You might say I am kind of addicted to In-N-Out ... not because they are the best burger (they're not) but because everything they do is consistently the highest quality and no matter how busy they are I've always been greeted by genuinely friendly and helpful employees. What other chain fast food place can you say that about?  The FLW location is the only AZ one I have been to, because it is convenient when I make my treks to Lowes or Trader Joes or other stores in the area.  They have beaucoup parking and the place is always sparkling clean (never any overflow in the trash containers like almost every other fast food place). The counter greeters are ALWAYS cheerful and upbeat, even after being barraged by 300 people during the lunchtime feeding frenzy.  The rest of the people behind the counter all look like they are waiting to be auditioned by GQ or Elle. And that brings up one reason I  like going to In-N-Out ... you can see everything they do behind the scenes, there are no mysteries about who's touching your food or what they are doing with it, you can actually watch your burger cook. Don't like it the way it's on the menu? No problem - they will fix your burger pretty much any way you want.  I don't mind the 5 minute (or so) wait for my order because I know what I get won't have sat under a heatlamp since breakfast. Thank you In-N-Out for not using a loudspeaker to announce when an order is ready, I like the personal approach of a friendly smiling face calling my name and handing me my order.  What's to be improved? Sorry In-N-Out if you're reading this but my last visit yesterday disappointed me a bit. You see, one of the trademarks I've become used to is the freshness of a crispy lettuce slice on my burger. What I got this time was a soft, wilted piece of greenery stuffed inside the sandwich that was in pieces so it fell out all over while I was eating it. That is something that simply should not have been allowed at In-N-Out and I hope it's not an indication of a slipping of their quality standards.  Wilted lettuce aside, I still give this location 5-stars for everything else."}
{"text":"6pm and the line was long like any in&out. the cashier was a beeeetch. when i told her \"I have gluten allergy so...(yup thats where she cut me off)\"  she told me \"yea so? what do u want?\"   WHAAAT rude!  anyways ordered a double double protein burger no spread grilled onions w fries  i ended up valeting my car at mandalay bay and since the idiots put the extremely WET burger on the bottom of the bag the meat patties & tomato slid on out to the ground...  MIND YOU I'm gluten free and it was going to be my first and only meal of the day...  not only did the idiots place a  completely wet burger on the bottom of the bag they topped it with 2 frenchfries order...2!!! no wonder it was so heavy it pushed it out :(   lost a burger....gained an order of fries and wrapped them in my lettuce! poo they even forgot the grilled onions...lasvegas in n out is a faaail  PS threes so many people but my fries were stale! stale! please tell me how thats possible"}
{"text":"Good burger if you need something quick. Great prices! Service is always great. Everyone that works there is always so nice. Burgers are a little on the small side compared to other places but tasty. I am from Texas so my heart will always belong to Whataburger when it comes to fast food burgers like this."}
{"text":"When can we get this great fast food hamburger spot on the east coast?  This is what McDonalds was 40 years ago. Got my burger Animal Style & those fresh cut FF are great."}
{"text":"I wish they have In-N-Out Burger in NY!! Delicious burger and fries! Their sauce is amazing!"}
{"text":"The tastiest hamburger restaurant I've ever eaten at. The burgers are completely newly made and super fresh. The fries are not intermediates, but is shared potatoes at the restaurant and then fried. Much tastier. It is usually very busy, but it's worth waiting for. A plus that they have a menu with about 3 hamburgers, making the work flow of the kitchen better."}
{"text":"Love me some In n Out...so, I live in a state devoid of this great burger establishment so I always enjoy an opportunity to stop in and blow my calorie consumption for the day.  Upside is consistency, customer service, freshness and fun...love it animal style. Onions by request but plenty which I love...  It can often be a bit sketchy to find a seat but be patient, generally by the time your food is ready someone has finished and moved on."}
{"text":"As far as fast food goes, this really is as good as it gets. The employees are friendly, the restaurant is clean, and the food is fresh. They cut the fries right in the kitchen and make each burger to order. I like mine animal style! I also love the little hot peppers they have in the fixins bar. I wish In-N-Out would venture to the East coast!"}
{"text":"The 5 star rating is in comparison to other fast food joints (i.e. Mickey D's, Burger King, J-Box ect. NOT sit-down joints... I would take a Four Peaks burger over I&O any day!)  I usually get grilled cheese with frilled onions, but I have had many a burger here. Fries are really good, but they do not age well, often becoming a little nasty on the ride home (202&Rural to Rural and Apache, not a long drive). Best staff in fast food, best food in fast food. Best burger in the world? Please, go to a real burger joint for that title, not fast food!"}
{"text":"This Particular In-N-Out is very friendly, even for In-N-Out standards.  The help are all diligent and quick, and also caring about their customer service.  If you are not familiar with In-N-Out they appear to have a simple menu of burgers, fries, drinks, and shakes.  They do have a secret menu (http://www.in-n-out.com/secretmenu.asp) which you should check out.  I get animal style on my burger AND my fries.  Delicious.  Also, make sure you pick up a shirt while you're there, at $9.50 it's almost a steal!!"}
{"text":"I have heard stories and dreamed about this day.  I have finally tired In-N-Out Burger @ Las vegas   This was like dream come true.  Let me say we went on a good time where that outside temperature was 98 degrees and this restaurant had a/c and room to dine inside!  We ordered 1 cheeseburger and 1 double with fries and drinks.  Food Pro: This place rocks. Burgers were well cooked. with fresh lettuces and tomatoes. Con: I expect more on the fries. Sort of disappointed.  I live in the south and always eating McDonald and Burger king and coming to Vegas able to hit the IN-N-OUT was one of my bucket-list.  Overall: It was a dream come true. I finally made it. I have joined the In-N-Out club. I feel proud :)"}
{"text":"Always busy, but super efficient! They really know how to handle a crowd. The food is always tasty. I especially love the Neapolitan Milkshake."}
{"text":"Sorry guys.  I have been to several In-N-Out's.  This one served old fries, and they were busy.  Dry bun and burger. Never had a dry burger at any other of their restaurants.  It could be a fluke, but my hubby's was the same. Will go back, and look forward to it, at another location."}
{"text":"In n out is the only fast food I will eat.   Consistency, 100% of the time and always delicious. I feel sorry for my east coast friends who can't experience this place.   Employees are always awesome as well."}
{"text":"I am definitely warming up to this place. Easily the best fast food burger but grilled onions are a must. Drive thru wait is so worth it."}
{"text":"My favorite In-N-Out because the lines aren't crazy here. Service is always friendly as all hell and the restaurant is super clean.   I always feel guilty eating fast food. Thankfully, In-N-Out has it's not-so-secret menu and I don't feel too bad eating my Double-Double Protein (bun becomes hand leaf lettuce) and Animal (sauce, pickles, and grilled onions) Style, which clocks in at 520 calories. It's a filling and satisfying burger. I usually skip the fries here because of guilt.  When I'm sick, I crave shakes. Again from their not-so-secret menu I get the Neapolitan shake. The shakes are so thick that you can really taste all three flavors individually. I love it when it goes from vanilla, to strawberry, to chocolatey. It's more bang for your buck!   In-N-Out is a chain and I'm rarely a fan of those establishments, but In-N-Out truly is freshness you can taste. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but I am definitely a fan."}
{"text":"How do you review a chain? This is an In-N-Out Burger. You either like it or you don't. This one is just like the myriad of others, but it is the closest one to my home and most convenient for lunch.   The building is the same design as most of the ones I've seen open in the past few years: there's limited seating inside and always people doing the \"vulture\" thing during lunchtime. The employees are efficient and helpful, and the food is exactly what you'd expect.  I like my Double Double \"Animal Style\" with chopped chilis on it, and when I have been running a lot and can afford the extra calories, I get my fries \"Animal Style\" as well -- don't forget a fork and a place to sit... they can get messy.  What's New: they now take American Express credit cards."}
{"text":"This is an In-N-Out burger, so you get the expected fresh beef burgers and hot, fresh fries. You can read all over the place why In-N-Out is excellent, and I think you can believe the hype.  I went through the drive through on this visit and was met out there, despite the 40-something degree weather, by one of the employees who took my order in person. Did I mention that it was after midnight? Yup, they are open until 1am on weeknights.  My food was hot and tasted great -- I got a double cheeseburger \"animal style\" (extra veggies and grilled onions) with \"animal style\" fries on the side (fries with melted cheese, dressing, and grilled onions). After a long day spent in a variety of airports, this was a great \"welcome home\" and a worthy detour on my way home."}
{"text":"Burger placed upside down and fries thrown in bag by rude girl at window like it was trash. Never coming back. Go somewhere else this place is terrible"}
{"text":"Man oh man, do I love a good In-N-Out burger! I may be a little biased here but coming from the east coast, the proper Burger joint is certainly any In-N-Out place! Lines were long but that was typical. Food and menu straight to the point but if you are feeling adventurous, do explore their \"Secret Menu\". If you aren't from the west coast and looking for a quick bite, visit In-N-Out especially here in Las Vegas, right after you hit the tables or the slots!"}
{"text":"GOAT. That's how good this place is. The burgers are very juicy and delicious the fries have the perfect amount of salt. Then don't even get me started on the drinks like this place is so good im glad it's a thing."}
{"text":"When I think of In-N-Out Burger I begin to drool. The animal style cheeseburger combo is what I usually order. I have been to a few other locations and decided to try this one out last weekend. I couldn't believe how large and busy this location was! I know In-N-Out is popular but I was blown away by how many people they can fit into this location. The parking lot was larger than average and full. This location is kind of a pain to get to with traffic as well. We went through the drive thru, where a woman was waiting with a clip board to take our order. We waited about seven minutes in drive thru before receiving our food which we took home to eat. As usual it hit the spot. I have not tried to shakes yet, but it is on my to do list.   *Tip: Order extra spread sauce on the side to dip your fries in."}
{"text":"I get a lot of flak from people out west for my love of In-N-Out Burger.  They're spoiled.  The last time I went, I got a 3x3, animal style, with green chiles, extra toasted buns.  It was amazing and I wish I could drive to one right now.  Alas, I'm in Illinois.  These establishments are always clean.  Staff is always fine.  Sometimes, there's a pretty good wait, but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"What can I say. I am a hamburger slut. When I lived in Seattle I pined for the mecca of In-N-Out. Definitely a plus to moving to the Phoenix area.  Here are 2 major things I like about In-N-Out in in general: protein style and the fries.   I've eaten at this location, oh, hmmm.. a \"few\" times now. I have noticed some quality differences. Sometimes the fries are a little dry. Or a little mushy (which is exactly how I like them actually.) Sometimes my burger tastes a little bit like onions (which I like) and sometimes it doesn't. I've tried ordering w/onions and w/grilled onions but it doesn't give it the same taste. Sometimes the tomatoes suck and I take 'em off.   Those inconsistencies are what is adding up to this place not getting 5 stars. But, of course, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have been in Vegas for 6 months now and am just starting out on Yelp mostly because of in and out. We don't have in and out back east but it is talked about in very high regard so I had to try it. And I did several times including the \"secret\" menu items, but I don't understand the hype, it is just a typical greasy burger and the menu is way too limited not providing any real \"lighter\" options. I only gave it 1 star (mc Donald's, Wendy's, Burger King, jack in the box, and Carl's Jr. Would not even get that) I would much rather spend a little extra for 5 guys or smashburger."}
{"text":"My other favorite place! I call it my cholesterol cheat day! It's so good and everyone is always so nice!"}
{"text":"Well what can I say about this place other then being \"bomb diggity!\" I usually order from their \"secret menu\" 3x2 protein style and animal style fries. Highly recommend this place! It's a classic! There staff is also friendly and always have a great personality."}
{"text":"The best post-marathon meal: In-N-Out Burger, Animal Style!   I hadn't had In-N-Out for 9 years, so call me deprived.  The last time I had it was in 2000 next to the UC Irvine campus.  I had no clue In-N-Out existed in Vegas, but my friends suggested it and off we went in our cab after I had run the 1st ever Rock N Roll Las Vegas Marathon.   Did that burger ever taste so good (Animal Style of course)!  The fries weren't as good as I remembered them to be.   The place was packed!  It was pretty hard to find seating for the 4 of us.  My next trip to an In-N-Out better not take another 9 years!"}
{"text":"What can I say...we love In N Out This particular location we attempted to visit the evening prior and was crazy busy, packed with people inside (standing and eating) as well as the drive through. We ended up going to sonic.   I love the concept, super simple - double cheese, cheese, or a hamburger. The choice is yours, we chose to eat the cheese and double.   Service: they had the system down and were still very friendly. May have to be louder when calling out numbers as it was loud from patrons.   Seating: it's a rat race to get a table, we usually get lucky and this time no different, scored a lovely booth -whom I offered to a lovely couple searching for a place to sit prior to our departure.   Prices: $23 for 3 cheeseburger combos and one double cheeseburger combo. Love it!!  Food: we love, love, love the French fries!!! When going to places, like McDonald's, we have to order our fries with no salt. But here they don't add it but give it to you separate The burgers have lettuce, tomato, and onions (at no charge- lol!!) free refills too.   Overall- worth it, quality and price: )"}
{"text":"Great food! Delicious burgers (double-double animal-style is my favorite), thin crispy fries and real vanilla shakes. Every time I visit a city with an In-N-Out I make it a point to go!"}
{"text":"This has to be  the absolute worst drive thru access   and street access EVER! What idiot planned this ? The protein style is okay, and my family says the cheeseburgers with a bun are good as well. The fries are always dry and tasteless. A waste of calories and money to order them, as if you're going to be bad, at least the French fries should taste good, and these do not. I do not get the \"hype\" about In and Out? The burgers are not phenomenal, and the fries are terrible. The drive thru line is very long, and access to this place is very inconvenient. I'd rather go to Freddie's Steakburgers if I'm going to eat unhealthy! Maybe it's this location ?"}
{"text":"Simple, quality products. Amazing Hamburgers. Fries are average. I'm not a burger person, but In-N-Out burgers are very good. Double Doublke Aminal style all day! Always crowded, prepare to wait in line and try to get it to go and eat else if you don't like crowded places."}
{"text":"I ordered the cheeseburger and fries.  I was really eagerly hoping that the meat on the burger would be reallly tasty but I couldn't even distinguish it from all the lettuce and tomatoe....seriously, it tasted like a lettuce sandwich which is truly disappointing after hearing all the great things about this place.  The fries were thin and crispy but somebody unfortunately went WAYYYY overboard with the salt.  They were the saltiest fries I've ever tasted and wish I'd ordered a drink because I sure needed it after all the salt.  The bun on the burger was okay, just average.  I prefer a sesame seed bun. Maybe I should try one of the \"off the menu\" variations and find my sweet spot.  But for this first visit, I was totally underwhelmed and the price was too high - $2.25 for a burger.  That's too high for fast food which isn't even \"fast\" in that you do have to wait for a few minutes while they prepare the food.  I may try again....I may not.  Wish I could have tasted the beef!!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is BUSY! They are turning out hamburgers at a spectacular rate and it's not even lunchtime or the dinner rush but about 5 pm.  There is very little you can complain about here because you get a fresh and tasty burger for a great price every time.  It's difficult to say anything new about these restaurants. You are either a fan or you've never eaten at one. If you don't live in one of six states in the west/southwest, you won't have had the opportunity to try one of their juicy hamburgers.  The menu is simple and the secret menu is yours to discover.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is the closest in n out burger near my home and the one I'm most likely to be visiting. I've been coming here for months now and I have to say I've never had a negative experience with the staff members and their customer service is good.   This particular visit was through the drive thru. It seems like the drive thru box was broken so a staff member was taking orders. Luckily it wasn't too hot so the staff member seemed fine but I do hope they were rotating members. If you go through the drive thru you can actually see the kitchen through the glass. Glass was pretty clean and everyone working had on a hair net and was wearing gloves. The staff members were organized and it seemed like they were having fun due to the laughter within their face.  I got my meal quickly and efficiently. When I want to get a fast food burger I come here and skip every other fast food chain."}
{"text":"I work in this area and when I want to eat out for lunch this is usually the place I go to. The staff is friendly and a half open window so you can see how clean the area is and the food is always excellent and I have never had my order wrong here before and I've been a pretty regular customer.  My only issue with a drive-through entrance it seems like you have to go a certain way to be able to turn fully into it and that's kind of uncomfortable if I had to circle around. I'm not sure if the drive-through box it's broken but there is a way to staff member that is taking order outside and while the weather is pretty nice today I feel bad if the weather is colder super windy. I've never had a negative interaction with any of the staff and even though it's tiring they always have a smile on their face which I appreciate!"}
{"text":"One of the best In N Outs i've ever been to! Employees are always happy and if you finish your food and having a conversation with someone, they offer to pick up your trash and throw it away! They go above and beyond!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good burger for cheap, here is your spot. I've been here multiple times but thought I should finally give a review.  I came here with my 11 month old son last night while my wife was at a meeting. The staff was super friendly and helpful. They got me a table all set up with a high chair and even brought me my order (usually you have to get it yourself).  I got a double-single, yep you can customize your burger, 2 patties and 1 cheese, with grilled onions. It was great. Fries were fresh and my usual strawberry shake was great as usual."}
{"text":"Fries and a 3x3 make for a perfect square meal. The milkshakes take some serious suction to get through a straw, but get better as they melt a bit."}
{"text":"The food definitely lived up to the great reviews!! Being from Chicago I've always heard from family and friends and wow! Animal style burger, animal style fries, and a chocolate shake you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"How can you beat a double double animal style for $3.50??? McWho? Great service at the drive through. We need these in Washington."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the burgers! This place is always packed at lunch both inside and out. The fries are a bit on the dry side so I always pass, but the milkshakes more than make up for it. The burgers always leave you wanting more. They come fully loaded with almost an entire onion on them, so if you don't want onion breath for days maybe take a pass. The staff are even better than the food - expedient and friendly. By far the best burger joint around."}
{"text":"After being in Portland for quite some time, I've been craving for the good ol' In-N-Out Burger!  I convinced my grandma to make a pit-stop here for my usual: #2 with grilled onions + fries + strawberry shake = happy tummy!  Service here was quite superb! Friendly, fast and no frills! This location is very close to the 215 freeway, so you can't miss it!   Thanks, In-N-Out for satisfying my cravings!"}
{"text":"Always hear rave reviews so thought I'd give this a shot.  Never had In 'n Out and I'm still in awe as to what all the fuss is about.  It's a typical fast food burger, like McD's with the special sauce and all.  I'm sure others will beg to differ but I can at least say I've tried it."}
{"text":"I'm a California native living in Indiana. They continue to live up to the standards of amazing food and fast serves. It was quite busy when we came in but we got or food quickly and I enjoyed food from my childhood!!   Definitely try the shake made with real ice cream!!"}
{"text":"LOVE IT. If i was to ever have an affair it would be with a IN N OUT BURGER. Fresh patties and toppings and fries. The wait can be a little long but Its a Wait thats well worth it. Try Animal Style Arrrr Giggity."}
{"text":"Ahhh ALAS MATEY. I wanted Burger King but then over the Hill I see the Rotating In N Out sign. Steer YE SHIP towards Yee Parking lot. It was busy but hey ITS right off the strip. If you havent been to IN N OUT please go. Its been years since i had the tasty morsel of a In N out burger. And it was just how i remembered it. Sure your going to wait for your food because its busy as hell but its a worth it kind of wait. Fresh Fries. Fresh burgers so fresh im sure the cow was grazing earlier today. Get the fries Animal style. Its not on the menu. YOUR WELCOME. And the shakes are made to with real ice cream. Does it get any better MAYBE Maybe not. I leave full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Great Food, excellent customer service. I was admittedly apprehensive about eating fast food in Henderson because I've been let down so much, but these guys have hit the mark every time I've made a visit. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"Best burger ever...greasy, melting in your mouth.  My kids always miss it when we go to the east coast.  The line is long, wait time is usually 30 min.  So don't rush when you come.. But that's how you know the place is that good."}
{"text":"I love this place! Just gave such a mediocre review to the awful Sahara location when I found this one! Basically everybody knows hands-down In-N-Out are the best burgers around. This one (I call the mother ship) was the first location I ever ate at and 9 times out of 10 I will specifically drive to this location that I no longer live anywhere near just to have the good service! Personally I am not a fan of the animal-style as I hate onions but on the double-double they work. If you are going through the drive-thru always say you are eating in the car even if you aren't because the box they put it in is way stronger than the napkin-esque bag they put burgers in otherwise."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is undisputedly on everyones top 5 burger places in America, But this Sahara location is probably the worst one in the valley. They are decent, but with overly agonizing wait times, usually cold fries, and employees who seem not to care about you, I have not had a good experience here in the 4-5 times I have gone to this location. Whenever I am on this side of town, I would rather go to old mickey D's ; at least I have a better chance of getting awesome fries. Love In-N-Out, just not this one!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way out of town for a trip.  They were busy but we were helped fairly quickly.  We got our food and were able to get a seat no problem.  The food was great as always.  The staff was very friendly and they had people walking around checking on tables and clearing trays.  We will definitely be back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"I enjoy In-N-Out from time to time and recently stopped in at this one.  We were in and out (pun intended) relatively quickly.  The staff was super friendly and our food came out fast.  We both had 3x3's protein style with onions...delicious and hit the spot.  If you are in the area, stop in and check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Always come to this location over the one on Lake Mead even though no matter what time of night you come they always have a long line but they never mess up my order though so I will continue to come. I love ordering things on the \"secret\" menu."}
{"text":"Very Dissapointed!! Fries were so well done they taste like potato chips and you could snap them !! Called in to inform and got directed to a line where they are rude and don't really want to hear about it it seems! Soooo Dissatisfied,  not normal for in and out!"}
{"text":"Impressive customer service!  For the first time ever here my order was wrong.  I went through the drive thru and did not look in my bag until I was about 30 minutes away from this location.   Since I could make it back to correct the order I called.  The only number I could find to call was the 1-800 number.  The issue was resolved with compassion and concern and I applaud them for this.   On top of the employees always being friendly, they move the large volume of customers along with ease.    I went one night during a peak time and there were 15 cars in front of me in the drive through, they averaged 1 minute per car, also impressive!  Nothing like a good ol in n out meal!"}
{"text":"Like all of the In n Outs: Friendly well trained staff. Clean for how busy they always are. Consistent. good, fresh, fast food at value prices. why would anyone eat at Micky Ds or the King?   I just wish they had some healthier options like chicken/vegi, but I guess they only do a few things, and do them well. It's better than a place with dozens of things on the menu all done badly.  Tip: Google their secret menu."}
{"text":"Oh why can't there be one just a few miles away from me, why must these tasty morsels live on the other side of the country. The juicy, salty, meaty burgers of carnivore dreams, dripping with gooey cheese and grilled onions. The secret sauce part of irresistible draw. The huge portion of fries, served animal style of course. The happy customers eating the mounds of fast food in big red booths smile as the sauce drips everywhere. The delightful staff, proudly serving their delectable meals. The fountain drinks and shakes to accompany the lovely meal.  Try the Neapolitan shake, with all three flavors together. Don't forget to check out their \"secret\" menu online, with wonderful creations such as the grilled cheese and the 3x3. Please open a restaurant in maine!!!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out, the speed of service and the quality of food exist within the name itself.  Over the years the company has not allowed competitors or customers to affect its quality of food or the incredible assistance it provides constantly.  From the usual double-double with everything on it to the delicious strawberry shake waiting on the counter, In-N-Out products do not cease to please or surprise.  By using exuberant welcoming colors such as yellow, red, and white, sitting inside the restaurant proves to be both enjoyable and exciting.  Simplicity, the key to In-N-Out's success has proven to be a valuable piece in the growth and advancement of the company.  All in all In-N-Out Burger provides both an experience and quality for anyone from 10 to 100 to enjoy!"}
{"text":"The #1 and #2 is consistently perfect no matter what city you are in!! There is a in and out store here and the drive through is a little different, long single line through the back."}
{"text":"Is it me or is in-out-burger burgers not that \"amazing\" anymore?  I used to love going to in-N-out and ordering a #2, grilled onions with no tomatoes and instead of soda. I would substitute it for a strawberry shake.   Food (3) I feel like they are going down-hill and not only that but their prices are getting higher.  I was surprised when I saw how much they increased the prices.  (I mean they didn't increase it by that much, but it was enough for me to notice)  They increase their prices, but they did not increase the quality of the food.   The burger made me want to vomit, after several bites I had to but it down and cover it with napkins. However, maybe it was just this one time that the burger didn't taste as great.  Because most of the time, I really love going here .  Atmosphere (3.5) They maintain their area and place is always clean, reminds me of a modern diner.    Service (5) Everyone is very friendly, seems like a majority of them are either ln high-school or college students that work in this location.   Overall (3.5) Rounded up because though I had a bad experience once, most of my experiences were great here."}
{"text":"I try my best to avoid fast food chains, but extended amounts of time away from home always have me craving for a protein double double animal style. If I am feeling extremely gluttonous, I go all out with animal fries and a chocolate milkshake.   The \"secret menu\" enhances the already delicious burgers. Animal style consists of grilled onions, their house sauce (think thousand island), and cheese. It is artery clogging goodness. Protein style burgers come without the bun and wrapped in lettuce. I convince myself that by cutting out the bun, I am doing myself a great favor and ignore the calorie overload I am ingesting.    The burgers are the main star and surpasses all other chains in flavor and value. The fries are my least favorite because they are too starchy. That is the problem with fresh cut fries, they do not get the time to soak and draw out the excess starch. By making them animal style makes it easy overlook this problem. The milkshakes are thick and rich."}
{"text":"I know it's a chain but I can't help but love it. Went here for a quick Father's Day drive through bite with the kids.  The first big thing about In-N-Out that I've always loved is that they actually listen and speak with you when you're at the drive through.  They do their greeting and then actually respond to what you say. They're actually listening and interacting. How cool is that for a drive through? I've seen that from time to time at individual locations of other chains but it's pretty much standard here.  Love that.  Then I also love the fact that they're pretty transparent. It's quite cool that they have the big window walls all through the drive through so you can actually see what's going on. I love the fact that they want you to see what they're doing and what the kitchen looks like. It's also way better than looking at a cement wall.  I also love that the food is made to order (no tomatoes, yes onions) every time. And I love the fact that they use quality ingredients (fresh vegetables, fries being just potatoes run through the slicer, fresh ground beef, etc.).  Then I love the fact that they give you a box if you're going to eat in your car and also that they cover your fries with a napkin. Just little touches like that show that someone actually was a bit into what they were doing when they set this business up.  And then, I just love the payoff of the double double and the fresh cut fries. For a quick drive through, can't beat it."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep coming here.. Seems like almost every time I come they mess my order soo much for being In & Out. I ordered a double double protein style with onions no sauce. They always ask if I'd like ketchup and mustard and I decline. Anyways I pulled up to the window and she hands me my drink.. I wait a few minutes for my order she starts handing me a regular double double and I tell her it's wrong I asked for protein style and she says \"it doesn't say that here it says lettuce, tomato, onion only I looked at her with a blank look on my face and say well I asked for protein style.. At which she turns around with an attitude and comes back and says sorry about that we'll have that out in a bit. I wait for 5 minutes and she returns with the protein style.. I thought I checked it for sauce which I guess I didn't because now I'm home sitting with a half melted cheese burger with sauce on it. I'm debating on going back but I'm too tired  Next time I will speak to a manager if they mess up my order twice. Not happy at all. Maybe I'll try the In&Out on Tropicana"}
{"text":"For the most part, fast food is not a staple of my diet. In-N-Out was the first burger I got after a two year leave. It is still a place I crave for from time to time. Due to that reason, it is placed on the highly dangerous list.   It has been over a year since I have gone to In-N-Out and it was time to get me a #1 Double Double Combo. I was never a huge fan of their fries because they often taste cardboard like, but for some reason I really enjoyed them last night. They were fried to a crisp perfection. The burgers are always spectacular and beats out any other fast food joint. The only thing that can make my burger better is to order it protein style\". Wrap that meaty cheesy goodness in lettuce and let me fool myself into thinking it is healthier."}
{"text":"Same good burgers, but the lines are extremely long. Most of patrons are visitors from out of town who are wanting to try the west coast phenomenon. When we went it was to the door cramped inside and a full drive thru line.  I guess that is just the price you pay for a high quality burger meal at fast food prices."}
{"text":"By far my favorite fast food burger. It does not matter what location, these freshly off the grill burgers are made with premium ingredients and burst in your mouth with every bite.  Every location has a long line, but the associates are like a well oiled machine. The service is friendly. Every request is met with a smile.  Though their menu is simple, the ability to customize one's burger is exponentially unlimited. Ask for hot peppers and perfection can be improved upon."}
{"text":"My favorite burger joint and this time, with my favorite family members.  We were here on a sisters weekend retreat and ordered our original cheese burger with grilled onion.  Sister is gluten intolerant...got the protein style and LOVED it.   Be sure to get the spread to dip your yummy fries in.   This is a large In n Out to accommodate all the tourists visiting Las Vegas!  Gotta love the xtra blingy lights to remind you its Vegas-Baby!!  Tips and Hints....park next door at the corporate building.  Keep away from busy parking and shop while you are there."}
{"text":"Honestly, not sure what all the hype is.  The burger was average and so were the fries, and the line was too long.  I'm a bigger fan of Shake Shack for sure."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I last had In N Out Burger. This place is no different from any of the other ones. It's just always busy on a weekend with the drive-thru line going around the block. I tried a simple cheeseburger and fries animal style and had a fairly good experience. I still feel like their fries are not as good as they could be though but the animal style definitely helps. I'm looking forward to trying their shakes some day and I hope they don't taste like air like so many other fast-food milkshakes."}
{"text":"First time at this location. I love In n Out burgers and fries. One of the few fast food places I'll eat at. This location is just as good as the others I've had. Clean. Pleasant employees, you wait a few minutes for your food, but it's worth it. It's always hot and fresh."}
{"text":"You either love em or hate em. Well I love em. When I'm craving a burger I won't go to In-n-Out, I have a separate special craving for In-n-Out.  My air conditioner broke and didn't want to heat the house any more trying to cook, I haven't been in a while, so I headed to my closest In-n-Out. Luckily got in right before the rush, so I got my order in quick and didn't wait too long for my food.  Oh why have I been away so long? Just as I remember, nice and warm fresh burger, with crunchy vegetables and melty cheese. Yum. Fries were hot and crispy. So good.   Made my day of waiting for repair men, not so bad."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better unless you go to a gastropub and get a burger.   This place truly does cook what the customer wants. The secret menu has some creative and amazing eats. Well done fries are my latest favorite."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with a #2 animal style order for a late night stop on the strip. Came here with my friend from Ireland that was super excited to try it for the first time. Never disappoints and for the amount of people that come here, the service is pretty fast. Took off one star because the table we were sitting at outside kept rocking back and fourth."}
{"text":"This particular In-N-Out Burger has a horrible drive thru set up. It wraps around the parking lot with other businesses and makes an inconvenient for everyone.  Management should rethink that as its on private property; or the property management of that shopping center should make a decision.   When I was waiting in the centipede of cars to go through the drive thru, there was almost a brawl because of the right of way and then a Jeep was trying to take advantage and cut the line.  The establishment puts their employees outside in harms way; not cool In-N-Out Burger management.   My food was great by the way."}
{"text":"This is a great in and out. Food of course was awesome and the service here is always the best. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Can't say anything bad about In-N-Out because it's just so good! I always get a dougle-double with grilled onion and hot chili peppers in it and it's so delicious! Don't get the hot chili pepper if spicy is an issue since it's pretty spicy.. don't forget to get the animal style fries!"}
{"text":"It's what a hamburger's all about.  Ever smoke crack? I have. While eating a Double Double off the a$$ of a stripper.  Just like Doogie Howser in Harold & Kumar.  Except it was a Double Double with grilled onions , not a big fat line of coke.  I was able to kick the crack. Still working on the strippers.  I will never be able to quit In N Out.   Remember to order a chocolate shake."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of this place. Quality food, Love it!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about In N Out Burger. It doesn't matter what location you go to, their food is always the same (AMAZING)!!!"}
{"text":"I can't say anything bad about in n out... It's always been too quality food at a good price... I enjoy there animal style burgers.."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great refreshing burger with freshly cut fries, this is the place.  I highly reccomend dining in rather than taking it to go simply because the fresh cut fries are likely to get cold and soggy quick.    If you're adventurous, try getting your burger or fries \"animal-style\", while it's not on the menu the employee working the register will know what you are referring to.  Animal style consists of melted cheese, special sauce, and grilled onions, simply delicious.    Another great menu option is the protein-style burgers where the bun is replaced by crisp refreshing lettuce.    Finish off your classic American meal with one of their three thick milkshakes!"}
{"text":"Neener neener neener!  This review is simply for my East Coast friends to rub it in their faces that I had mine ANIMAL STYLE, baby!"}
{"text":"I have family in the west coast, and I specifically make a point to go to in-n-out whenever i get the opportunity.  This place beats any conglomomcfastfood place hands down.  The best part about it is the special sauce... it somewhat resembles a the big macs special sauce, but BETTER.  The animal fries are fantastically fatalicious, and worth breaking your diet for.  The food is just so simple, and so totally flippin sweet, it makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  My family may have gotten mad at me for making them wait to eat their food so I could get some good shots, but so be it."}
{"text":"Man, the restaurant prices in Las Vegas have gone through the roof!  Absolutely insane, and many of the restaurants don't even serve any memorable food.  After eating an expensive dinner at Caesar's, I went to see the Beatle's Cirque du Soleil LOVE show.  By the time the show ended, I was kind of hungry again and went for a stroll on the way back to the hotel.    I saw a massive In-N-Out neon sign on the strip and made my way over.  Here is a tip, the restaurant is actually kind of hard to find.  Just keep walking towards the ferris wheel and it will be on your right hand side, if you're coming from the strip.  Anyways, I stopped in and they were doing brisk business even though it was 11pm.  So there was a bit of a wait but the cheeseburger I ordered was excellent, the bun was crispy and fresh, the fries were tasty and the lemonade hit the spot.  The In-N-Burger was way better value than anything served at the restaurant's on Caesar's properties."}
{"text":"Living on the East coast you constantly hear people talk about how good In-N-Out Burger is.  How it's life changing.  I was skeptical but made sure to find a location nearby while I recently out West.  The menu is simple with a lot of secret items.  The burgers are inexpensive and delicious.  The staff was friendly and make you feel right at home.  I believe in the hype now and will be back to this location or another In-N-Out when I'm back out West."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love In-N-Out? Even as cram packed as it I had great service with a smile, my order was accurate and timely, and it was very clean inside"}
{"text":"Im giving you permission to laugh at me, as soon as you finish reading this.  I may be the only person to have never tasted the burger \"animal style\".   I had it today.  I'm a Jersey girl from before the fake housewives ruined it, so I know a little about roadside burgers.  The 'animal style\" burger took me back to my days at AW Root Beer and other mom and pop drive ups - not to be confused with drive thrus. Just in case you are like me and are oblivious to this burger terminology, \"animal style\" means grilled onions, pickles, and extra dressing. I had a little tamer animal with only moderate dressing.  The young lady was kind enough not to openly judge me.  Next time, I will get the animal style fries. They come with sauce, cheese, and grilled onions. Ok, one tip - ask for extra napkins.  They were a bit stingy with the napkins considering I was dealing with an animal in the car."}
{"text":"Service:  5stars The service was on point very true to their name! The employees all were very polite and had smiles on their faces! I got my order in just a few minutes even though the building was packed. My order was correct and there was plenty of outdoor seating to make up for the smaller seating area indoors.  Cleanliness: 4stars The restaurant was clean with the exception of a few areas but they had several staff members working on the messy areas.  Food quality: 4stars The quality of the food was good! The buns were toasted perfectly and the burger was fresh and not too greasy or saucy! The fries were fresh and good but could use a bit more flavor."}
{"text":"In-N-Out Burger is great!  Their simple menu and fast service make it my number one fast food destination.  I love the double-double animal style, which is where they add grilled onions, extra sauce, and a pickle.  It's great.  And the fries are a great value as well.  You get a lot of fries for under $2."}
{"text":"My favorite burger. Period. This might be in my list of last meal foods. Food is always fast, fresh and delicious. It's awesome to still be able to find an old school style burger restaurant with a simple menu. You want chicken? Go somewhere else. You want turkey burger? You're in the wrong place. You want a salad? Get the hell out of here. You want a juicy burger with fresh toppings? In N Out is the place!  Outdoor seating is nice and ample. I usually bring my dog and sit outside, weather permitting. She loves fries and watching the birds.  This place is great and will always bring me back to my childhood. We used to always go to In N Out whenever we were in California. It was always a special treat for us since it was only located in one state.  Favorite secret: Animal Fries...trust me..."}
{"text":"Asher and Jose are by far the sweetest guys that work here! They are also extremely hard workers too!   Not so much the blonde, she always seems so angry and rude."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place because now I can say I`ve tried all the big chain burger joints (5 guys, Smashburger, etc.). First, I couldn't believe the prices when I first walked in! It was like 5 bucks for cheeseburger, fries, and drink. I ordered mine ''animal style'' from the ''secret menu'' which is made with grilled onions. The burger was so simple but tasty for the price. Their lemonade is delicious. I wasn't crazy about the fries...our batch was kind of soggy. Also, the shake was a bit too heavy and creamy for my taste. I would go back for the burger if only they had locations in the Midwest but I think my favorite burger chain is still Five Guys...it is more pricier but worth it."}
{"text":"Pretty good fast food! Service was really fast despite a huge line and the staff was very friendly. I only didn't like the bread for the burger but the rest was good! The animal style fries were also really good. Overall I'd say it was satisfying and better than most fast food places"}
{"text":"Why are the employees here so nice and happy? BECAUSE THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY IN N OUT GOODNESS!! oh east coast, u know we da best coast: but I'm woman enough to say we lack the sweet yumminess of this establishment. yea yea we have shake shack and its great too... but something about In N Out is the best. Is it because its too far from me? I used to feel the same about Chik Fil A, but now that we have it in NYC, I'm over it.. who knows.. only time will tell.  Either way, I get animal style on my burger and my fries. Keep listerine in the car but the breath be stank afterwards!! My husband and i have a plan when going in.. he gets in line and I scope out tables.. as soon as tables clear up, i pounce.. this place is ALWAYS full."}
{"text":"This is a true ALL AMERICAN business success. I wish I could actually give them a 4.5. The only drawback is they get pretty busy sometimes and it feels like a cafeteria in there. Otherwise, I've recently learned a lot about In and Out burger and I'm super impressed that they have their own cattle being served and their operations a so concise an smooth. I love that everyone there seems genuinely happy to be working there."}
{"text":"Perfect burger and fries every time. Fast ordering and great prices. These kids at this place work really hard and always are friendly. They do such high volume they could use a bigger eat in area and a double line drive through. I eat here every week and they always exceed expectations with a smile on each visit."}
{"text":"Just a note... if you go to the drive thru and tell them that you're eating in your car, they'll give you an open box instead of a bag.  They even offer a placemat!  Sweet!"}
{"text":"Former Angeleno have moved back to the midwest but when I remembered Arizona has In-N-Out Burger, we went straight here right off the plane for lunch.  (Yes, seriously.) I know, there are fewer In-N-Out Burgers in Arizona, but it was as you expect every chain to be with lines and fighting the crowds to get a table to sit at. But its all totally worth it! Even waiting a little bit for your number to get called, it feels like playing burger bingo! I was thankful to get a piece of West coast and didn't have to go as far as Cali to get it! The trip here was awesome as usual. just simple #2 and made my cousin go for it and get the Double-Double! Good food as always."}
{"text":"Never had a single issue stemming from this place. You wait an average 10 minutes but that's because they always have customers. Food is always amazing!!"}
{"text":"Editing up a star as I've gotten 3 in a row - what I ordered!   Yeah!  ////  3 Strikes you're out!  I have to stick to this.  I'll check back in after a mid/late shift management change in a couple months...  I do NOT understand how this place can mess up orders 3 times in a row and my last burger (note this was a dual order that I ate with another INO regular) - was really really bad - we both agreed it was alien.  Not sure how this place is slipping through its high quality standards but somehow it has.  This was my favorite quick burger place.  I'll save my INO visits for other locations in the near future.  Totally Totally bummed out."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to an INO, Go!  This is Arizona's #1 location.  Price, service, quality and cleanliness can't be matched in the industry.   Granted its not the easiest place to get into and expect a line (understand they are great at moving it).   They have some amazing employees here.  My favorite is a double single animal style add whole raw onion.  I'm a fan of the Neopolitan shake (off menu of course).  If you haven't been - Race on in."}
{"text":"I didn't think I would fall for such a talked about burger joint the way I did for this! Ugh...simply worth all the buzz! Why is this not in Colorado exactly?!   Anyway, not only was my food simply amazing, but it was made exactly to my specifications. The staff at this location were professional and seemed to actually really enjoy their jobs; this says a lot about either the management, or the corporate culture.   I got a cheeseburger with extra cheese and my boyfriend got an animal style burger. We split the animal fries sans special sauce, and it was worth every.single.bite. Even the milkshakes were bomb! Definitely worth checking out!"}

{"text":"I don't understand all the hype.  First visit here I thought was mediocre, but figured I'd give it another shot.  It wasn't any better.    The burgers were ok.  The meat patties are paper thin (like a White Castle burger).  The taste ok, but if you're looking for a manly burger, go somewhere else.  The special sauce (thousand island) gave it a little flavor.    I saw them cutting up fries when I entered so my hopes were high that at least they would be good.  Wrong!  They cut them so then, then overcook them.  They were too hard/done.  I've had shoestring potatoes that weren't that crispy.  Price was good.  Maybe that's why people love this place."}
{"text":"They have it down. Like James Brown.  Burgers, malts, fries. It's all good and the price is exactly right for the quality. I'd say excellent for fast food, but just okay for a sit down burger.  Drive through if you're in a hurry, it's definitely not a super-fast service and they do expect you to know WTF you want when you get up to the counter so study the menu if you have to and order like a pro!"}
{"text":"This place is CROWDED but they're a machine! They somehow take your order and leave you waiting much less time than you'd expect for your food. The food is the usual fare and what seem to be close to normal prices. It was a nice night so we just got our food and ate outside, the seating area is pretty big but I'm sure it gets packed at times. Forget all those overpriced mediocre strip places, if you want the best quick cheap meal on the strip come here and you won't be disappointed. Maybe they'll eventually be open 24 hours?"}
{"text":"Same amazing food as the location closer to the strip but this one is less crowded and is located in a giant strip mall so there's plenty of parking. If you want the giant gift shop, go to the one by the strip but you'll get the same food here and a shorter wait. I don't normally eat fast food burgers PERIOD but this really is worth a try."}
{"text":"Simple menu, excellent food, great prices! If you've never been you need try it, if you've been you already know. Can be crowded but worth it and check out the gift shop next door."}
{"text":"One of the best fast food restaurants in my opinion. The service has always been excellent. The staff have great customer service. They are always smiling and quick to get your order to you. I would recommend the animal style burger and the animal style fries! Look up the secret menu if you have not! The food at this location is always fresh and tastes great every time. Also their milkshakes are the best the chocolate one in particular try one next time if you haven't already you won't regret it!! Love in n out burger it definitely lives up to its name as being one of the best places to eat!"}
{"text":"I have always loved in n out burger. This location is a bit busier than others. However the staff are impeccable amd have outstanding service. Even though it's busy they are quick and efficient. Definitely would recommend the animal style burger it is amazing! Oh an of course if you need a little sweetness to go with it their shakes are wonderful. The chocolate is amazing. If you are getting your order to go be sure to ask for some of the secret sauce to go with your order you won't regret it! :)"}
{"text":"Yum!!!! YUM!!!!! yUM!!!!  Without a doubt the best burger chain!!!! Order it \"animal style.\" We also ordered the fries the same way. Banana peppers are by the catsup....don't forget them to spice up your burger a little."}
{"text":"It has been over 2 years since I had an In-N-Out burger & this place made me so happy!!! I went inside due to the long line in the drive-thru. Parking was easy to me. There was a short line inside, but I didn't mind.   The prices are extremely reasonable and you get such large portions. I had the burger and fries. Both were very tasty!!  I would highly recommend this business because the location is great, efficient, no problems, tasty food, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I stopped in tonight on my way back up to Flagstaff, as I always do when I'm down in the valley. Food is always quality and Nick was super helpful! Always will recommend!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't LOVE in-N-Out Burger??? You!! Bye!!!!! Lol   I been to this location a couple of time and customer service is always on point and very consistent.   I've eaten inside and went through the drive thru and the staff is always friendly!   Is this your first time? Omg you have to order my favorite, it's a double double, animal style onions and tell them proteins style (no hamburger bun, it's wrapped with lettuce) its to die for! So freakin delicious. If your daring, you can also get your fries animal style. Very tasty!   If you're like me and love the sauce, be sure to ask for more. They have it in packets (no charge) and make sure to order the pink lemonade.   The other great thing about In-N-Out is their prices. It's so freakin cheap compare to other fast food restaurants and the quality of food is on point.   Enjoy!!!! It's worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Is there a lettuce shortage at this location? Everytime...every... time I order a cheeseburger I get a teeny tiny piece of lettuce. Haha. So I've started ordering extra lettuce so that I actually get, the normal portion like you would get at other locations. But anyways, the drivethru line here moves quickly which is a good thing. Oh and if you order chopped chilies on your burger like I do, ask for extra. Again, they go real light on stuff here for some reason. Maybe I'm just spoiled by generous Cali locations..... Did I seriously just write a review about lettuce?? Lol. Ah well."}
{"text":"Always get my order right and always tastes amazing!!  I always make a stop when I travel to places there is an in-n-out!!"}
{"text":"This place amazes me!  These people work incredibly hard!  The place is ALWAYS busy!  The food quality, temperature of the food, and price are always good.  The food is hot, and fresh.  I support them as my \"fast food\" because they pay their people well, and treat them well. Why would I EVER stop at ANY other \"fast food\" place that pays, and treats their people like a number?  You might something cheaper, but I am not interested in less quality in any way!  I have been there once a week for the past year!  The people there are always friendly, and do things right!"}
{"text":"Its been 12 years since the last time I ate here, and I wasn't disappointed . I had a double double \" animal  style \" and fries the sme way and it was awesome."}
{"text":"After all the hoopla died down, or so it seemed, we decided to give the place a chance. First, there's ALWAYS a line stretching into the back forty because people believe the hype. We waited in drive-thru for approximately 15 minutes BEFORE we got to the speaker. Once there, we placed our order: 1 double cheeseburger, 1 regular cheeseburger, both well done, and two orders of fries. Simple enough, right?  Burgers were not done and VERY bland; the fries were like true shoe strings inasmuch they were cold, lifeless, and had as much flavor of a pair of laces pulled from my gym shoes. And-the girl who confirmed our order had to be told three times what we wanted... Two burgers, TWO fries.   We live in Arcadia and pass this location all the time. Every time, without fail, there is a line of cars stretching back into the parking lot and often times there's someone walking the cars taking orders with a tablet. While i admire this idea and think it's a good time saver, it might explain how what is supposed to be the \"the world's best burger\" comes out cold, tasteless, and less than something we could have done at home.  Trust me when I say if you want a truly tasty burger and the BEST fries in Phoenix, you really need to skip this monstrosity and had straight for Lucky Boy over on 16th street and Osborn. The food has always been delicious and you get a mountain of the best fries EVER!  Lucky Boy isn't open all hours of the night, but it's truly worth saving your money and taste buds to go there instead of this joke of advertising.   If i could give negative stars, this In-N-Out would get a negative 3!"}
{"text":"I'm neither up or down about In-N-Out, their prices rock, their fries rock, their shakes rock, but the burgers are lacking. I'm always amazed that this place advertises no fridges or microwaves or whatever but their burgers look like straight up McDonald's patties. Don't get me wrong, it's way better than McDonald's, but I wish the burgers had more of that 'Murican juiciness...but hey, you get what you pay for right?"}
{"text":"Its the standard in n out which is always good. Only thing different are the cast of characters  walking in..haha"}
{"text":"Du ER nødt til at spise in-n-out hvis du er vestpå hvor de findes. Det er altså bare den bedste fastfood burger der findes. Bestil animal fries hvis det skal være ekstra fedtet (det er fries med ost, bacon og løg - lækkert man) De står ikke på kortet, så det skal man selv nævne.  En af grundende til, at In-n-out kun findes på vestkysten er, at man vil være så tæt på sit lager som muligt, da man ikke tror på hverken mikroovne eller frysere. Nice ik? Kigger du ud bagved, kan du se hvordan de står og skærer kartoflerne friske som ryger direkte i frituren. Nom!"}
{"text":"I love In and Out burger. This location was super convenient to where I live. I went around noon and it was fairly busy as all in and outs are. Service was good and the store was clean. Parking was good as it's in a shopping center."}
{"text":"I mean... It's In And Out. Need I say more?? I like it Animal style!"}
{"text":"A must stop for any non-west coaster so they can experience the magic of an In-N-Out burger while visiting Vegas. On this past trip I also grabbed a grilled cheese from the secret men-u which was good.   Don't be intimated if the place is packed. The line moved very quickly and we got our food in a prompt manner."}
{"text":"Burgers are fresh and always hit the spot. Best pink lemonade ever. The only thing I don't like about in n out are the fries...I have to get them animal style otherwise they are pretty lame. Shakes are good too though!!"}
{"text":"In n out is a good go-to for those of us who are eating carbs. We love the simple menu and simple ingredients.   I'm writing this Yelp because I am concerned about how they are cooking the meat  We had 3 double doubles, protien style, but they weren't cooked all the way."}
{"text":"Always fast service. Clean establishment. Friendly faces.   We love their secret menu and the staff that's always willing to serve it.  It's extremely affordable and super delicious and one of the healthiest burgers I've found in this area.   Recommend over any other food in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Found it in AZ!!!! Usually located in Cali and I think there's one in Vegas, maybe Texas...but none on the east coast.  Decent fast food for the cheap price- burgers and fries!  Get the animal fries- not on menu so you gotta specify. They melt cheese on your fries and sprinkle other fat good stuff on.   Vanilla milkshake is pretty good too!!"}
{"text":"Very good for fast food .Every thing has a lot of flavor unlike McDonalds who has none .Though it is not the best fast food burger I have ever had that would be Shake Shack  and Steak-n-Shake is better . But still wish they would come to Indiana."}
{"text":"Can't beat this place for price. We had a delicious meal for two for about $10. The service was good, The food was good, and the staff was friendly. There was a homeless guy there stopping in to buy coffee. I didn't know that at the time but when I saw him in line, I gave $10 to one of the employees to buy him dinner and to get him a change. She looked at me like I was crazy, but he did end up joining us at our table for dinner and was grateful."}
{"text":"I have relatives that talk about in and out as if it's the best burger in town.  They come off the plane and head for nearest location.   We have tried this place on more than one occasion and feel it's just a burger.  The menu is short and sweet, so no big deal there, the price of the combo's are good, the hand cut fries are crispy and fresh.  We like to get the burgers with the onions, and the fries \"animal style\".  It's always busy, clean and if you're lucky, you can find a seat."}
{"text":"I felt like I was in Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle when I went to this place. For some reason, I thought there was an In-N-Out in the Flamingo. Not true. Then I thought it was in the Tropicana. Not true. Apparently it's on Tropicana Blvd across the highway. After 20 miles of walking that day (no joke) we decided to take a taxi there to get our bearings back.  $10 for a taxi ride and $11 for the food, it was still totally worth it.  Animal fries are to die for. Especially after having walked all day. And I was SO hungry.  We came here at 3 pm and it was still PACKED! It took a while to get our food, but again, totally worth it. The burgers are very fresh and delicious. But I cannot stress how awesome the animal style fries are. I wish I lived in an In-n-Out state just so I could get them on a regular basis.   YUM!"}
{"text":"Ordered all 4 items (double double, cheeseburger, hamburger, and fries) along with milkshake. Very cheap, but then again, portions are small (patty is maybe 2oz), so I guess that makes it decent pricing. Love the mayo-based spread. Fries are thin and crispy. Also enjoyed the milkshake very much. Came 2x and tried chocolate as well as vanilla. Both are excellent. Service is on the slow side for fast food, but overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"It is In-N-Out, how can you go wrong. This location is so busy that the food is always fresh and fast. The seating area is pretty large too and was appreciated since it was so HOT in summer. It is in the LINQ promenade so it was nice to be able to eat a big burger and walk around."}
{"text":"This In-N-Out location overflows with ravenous, liquor-soaked burger fanatics who have walked or cabbed across the highway in droves, and the burden of feeding these masses is reflected in the quality of the food. Everything tastes like it should, but you may find that the cheese on the animal style fries is a bit congealed, or the burger patties may be a bit more charred than usual. And though the service is brisk, you will definitely find yourself crowd surfing to pick up your order. However, this location has a small souvenir shop in the parking lot filled with reasonably priced shirts, hats, and tchotchkes that adds a dose of silly fun to your visit. With its yellow arrow adorned with flashing lights, this In-N-Out is definitely characterized by Vegas."}
{"text":"This one didn't meet the mark of what I've grown accustomed too. It was a sad day my only bad experience at any In n Out. Food was cold and very slow service. Employees were nice"}
{"text":"It was really good, hot and fast like always, at this location. whenever we visit Vegas it's usually our first stop. It didn't disappoint. 3x3 animal style! Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Very busy as usual. Don't ever plan on coming to in n out if you don't plan on waiting ! But the customer service is always great and so is the food. Service never fails!!"}
{"text":"This in n out burger always tries to bring your food out as quick as possible and i love that. It's always busy and that's the only downfall so you should always give yourself extra time if heading in. They also have the best shakes"}
{"text":"Honestly this place gets 6 stars. Not necessarily only for the food, but for the fact that there are probably so many intoxicated people that come in and they are so nice. I was one of the the other day LOL. Came in around 3:30 or so and ordered food for a few people. They were speedy and the order was right. Food here is always consistent."}
{"text":"The yelp opening hours are wrong.  They open at 10:30am.  We went at 10:15am and saw the door saying that it opens at 10:30am, so we expected to wait a little while.  But the door was open at 10:15am, and when we walked in they were glad to serve us food!  We were customers 2, 3, 4 that day :]  I got the usual, a double-double with grilled onions protein style, fries, and neapolitan shake.  Good good!"}
{"text":"They immediately addressed the issue. They assured they will do their best to not let it happen again. That's all I ask."}
{"text":"Every time I drive by this location the line is at least 20 cars long for the drive-thru. I've been here twice so far but have been inside compared to going through the drive-thru. The lines can be long inside but the wait time isn't too bad. I think the longest I've had to wait is 8ish minutes for my food. I definitely recommend going inside if you don't want to wait long for your food! Every time I've been here also there is barely any seating inside which sucks but I get that it's a new location and that's bound to happen! The employees are always nice and then one time I had a problem the manager fixed it right away and that was that :)"}
{"text":"I used to love this location and now I don't really like it. The inside is nice and clean and the employees are nice but there could be more seating since it usually is always busy. The lines inside and through the drive through are usually long so be prepared to wait. They never used to mess up orders and now all the sudden they messed up a order of mine (Which I don't know how they did since it's common sense.) I went through the drive through and ordered a protein style hamburger (hamburger wrapped in lettuce instead of on bread) and they gave me a hamburger after I had left. I was mad but I was just going to eat the hamburger and not the bread. Well, when I get home my so called \"protein style\" hamburger was only lettuce and tomatoes on a bun..... There so called \"trained\" employees obviously don't know what a protein style hamburger is! When I had clearly asked for a hamburger in lettuce! Seriously he person that made my meal was a total idiot! Really in n out? Really? I was really mad since I payed for it and it wasn't even what I wanted so I ended up throwing my whole meal away."}
{"text":"I love this location. Yes, it may be super busy every time I come here BUT the food makes up for it. They've never messed an order up of mine, the employees are always super nice and helpful when needed and definitely get the lines and orders moving fast. The store is always clean inside and you never really see trash coming out of the trash or on the floors. The food is always great and tastes super fresh as well."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly and super nice employees. Lines can always be long at In-n-Outs but on days like those at this particular location the employees definitely make the line go very quick and seem faster than it really is. Food is always amazing here. Easy location to find and of course they have very affordable prices."}
{"text":"I mean... It's in n out. It's always good. The staff at this one ate really good. We got animal style and I had the double double. Amazing. Every time I come to Vegas or cali I go to in n out sy least once."}
{"text":"Its a fast food burger joint that everybody talks about it here. So figured why not. It was clean and had friendly service. The place was packed. The food was.....ok. It isn't bad at all. I am just a Five Guy person. I like my burger juicy and greasy in a good way--if that could be good--and it is. I like my fries fresh cut or thicker. Here it's shoe string and they get cold fast. So I would recommend to try it, I am not sure of the hype, but for me I have other burger places to go back to."}
{"text":"went to order 3 number 1's tonight and the Biotch rings up 3 burgers,3fries and 3shakes separately to make the Bill over 25 Freakin Dollars,,,, and to top it off, the hamburgers were Rare and Cold. The Fries were Cold too. The shakes are so so. kinda plain for being Strawberry flavor. I will never go back. blah....................well actually went back to fight for some money back considering a number one is like 5.99 each you Rip Off's"}
{"text":"I ordered the Number #1 Meal double double animal style. Animal style is usually FREE I dont know if it is suppose to be Free here on the strip or not,but I was charged 4.50 for Animal Style Fries,and full price for the shake witch was 2.50. Instead of paying 8.xx something plus tax. I was charged $14.00 dollars total,ya thats right $14.00 dollars!!!!!. When my food was ready the double double had barely any onions or sauce on it, I asked the girl can I get extra onions. than I asked why am I being charged full price for a shake when I asked for the number #1 should just be a upgrade of a 1.xx something of small change,and she couldnt answer,or explain SHIT to me, very Stupid,Young,and Dumb. They food tasted like Crap out of a cleanser sink. So I went to in and out on Nellis and Charleston today to see what would happen if I ordered the #1 off the Strip. I got 2 numbers #1 for a little over $20.xx bucks plus tax. I was dumb founded. If at all possible I would go to the ones off the strip,or be sure to asked if they charge extra for how you want your food. I have photos of last night and today I will also be posting to show you the difference in Quality too!!!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan since I lived in L.A. It's a good thing it's in the opposite direction from work to home or it would become an addiction. I love the animal style or when I'm feeling good the protein style burgers. I like the way they make their fries and when I'm feeling really bad I order my fries animal style. I've never met a worker there that didn't look like they were enjoying their job. They all have great attitudes."}
{"text":"The best In N Out I've been to ever.  Hospitality includes getting refills for you, picking up your trays, cleaning any mess on your table that you may have made. I like coming during down times where the folks here chat with you and get to know their customers.   This is the only InO that does this so far.   Always the burgers are piping  hot off the grill!  It's worth coming here once a week.  Like now"}
{"text":"I can't say anything negative about this chain. Their food is delicious, the restaurants are always spotless, and the burgers taste unbelievably fresh. I must say that since discovering their secret menu, I am a protein burger convert. I don't order them for diet purposes or to watch what I eat...I just love how they taste.  Something else I love, the staff friendliness  from one restaurant to the next is consistently great and predictable.  A lot of burger joints and other chains could definitely learn a thing or two in terms of freshness, and the training of their staff."}
{"text":"In-N-Out you are my weakness! Delicious food, friendly and professional staff. But there is always a huge line!"}
{"text":"Like all In-N-Outs, they have great food and friendly staff, but the drive through line is always wrapping around the parking lot."}
{"text":"The service was truly awesome I was really impressed with the over the top service from the employs. Everyone is really nice and took great care of my family:)"}
{"text":"Entrance is typical fast food franchise.  Interior is plasticky but clean.  Menu is straightforward.  Hamburger and fries combination ordered.  The meal was good but nothing special.  I had a double burger and the amount of meat likely equaled 1 patty at Burger King or McDonalds.  Staff here were quick to greet.  Prices are a bargain."}
{"text":"I finally tried in-n-out and can proudly say I am a shake shack fan. I ordered the strawberry milkshake and grilled cheese sandwich. The strawberry milkshake made me want to go to McDonald for a mcflurry. It tasted so fake! As for the sandwich, this was the only thing on the menu that didn't have meat. It only comes with 2 slices of cheese so I request for double (a total of 4 slices) and ugh. People pay for this? I can make better grilled cheese sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I'm from NY so I don't have the pleasure of In-N-Out Burger as much as I would like but when I visit Las Vegas, I can't leave without a 4x4 from their \"secret menu\". It's def \"as good as it gets\"!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch while on the Promenade and each got a burger and split some fries. Per the reviews, we got the fries extra crispy which was a huge mistake, they looked normal but were completely overcooked and horrible. I got the sautéed onions on my burger and really liked the whole combo with the sauce. I mean, I'd definitely get this if I was craving a fast food burger and in the area. Still not sure why people say this is a must stop or even a first stop on their trips to Vegas, but overall, I'm still a fan."}
{"text":"I wish this was in my country!!!! The cheese burger is awesome, very delicious and not expensive. Love it"}
{"text":"This is a no-brainer for fast food.  In-N-Out sets the bar for me.  Tasty burgers, fresh fries, quick and efficient service and reasonable price.  The place gets packed with long lines and tough for finding a table but what do you expect?  Employees are working fast with a good attitude - what more can you expect when there are 30 people in line in front of you?  But the wait isn't bad and even the seating, although tight is always clean and fast turning!  Food:  My fave burgers and fries Price:  My kind of affordable Service:  Quick, courteous and positive energy."}
{"text":"Being from the east coast we don't have any in an out burger joints.  I am definitely a fan of this place the burgers are great only downfall is the lack of menu options and the lack of meat....  Fatten those patties up?"}
{"text":"No, I didn't drink a glass of haterade before I wrote this review. Don't get me wrong, if you put a double double in front of me, I'd gobble it up right away and wouldn't feed it to the dog. But they're not my first choice and I would actually drive right by this particular location to pick up a burger from a couple of other places.  Plain and simple, a burger should always be about the beef and In-N-Out doesn't have it. The patties are a minuscule 2 oz, which make it nearly impossible to cook them anything less than well done and I haven't had too many well done burgers jam packed with flavor. Well Art, why don't you order a 3 x 3 or a 4 x 4 if there's not enough beef? Why would I want 3 or 4 dry patties when I can get one 6 or 8 oz juicy patty?  Except for the ketchup/mayo/relish/thousand island sauce (which is a West Coast thing and don't think should come near anything, much less a burger), the condiments and bun are always fresh and beneficial to the burger. But in the end, they hide the beef. Thus, you have In-N-Out's genius plan: save money with less beef that cooks instantly, add fresh condiments and a sauce that people become addicted to, charge less than any other competitor, and you'll have people go ape shit and come in droves to get a hold of a burger.  The drive thru consistently is 5-10 cars deep and the dining area the majority of the time is close to capacity, but they are always efficient with the outside person in the drive thru to expedite the process. I do like the fries and shakes, but the burgers are not for everyone, including myself, and are just OK to me."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the high cholesterol or sodium that places like this offer. That's what keeps me away. This is the worse part of my review and decided to get it out of the way first. Well, this place is pretty damn good but I don't make it a habit although I could.  Very friendly staff and very good food.  Need I say more? In a pinch or in the middle of no where in SoCal, I'll go in if I'm hungry.  Although I'm a Burger King guy, I do enjoy this place.  And if the King is no where in sight, I have no problem with their product"}
{"text":"Simple good burgers fresh, easy menu. If you haven't experienced In n Out yet, just commit. The reason for my review today is that when we went to this location, the person who was on the headset was not annunciating her words and we literally asked her to repeat herself 5 times. It was a younger girl who thought it was cool to talk like that, I couldn't help but laugh about what this world is coming to. Regardless, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Still a fan but there's been a couple of \"oops!\" lately. Namely, they forgot to add grilled onions to mine and the wife's animal style burgers the other day. The shake was pretty darn runny as well... We'll give them another go and see if things are improving since typically In N' Out is top notch."}
{"text":"Great location. Very friendly and polite at the counter, as you'd expect. One of the employees came out to our table and gave the kiddos hats & stickers without any prompting, thanks!  Our food was cooked right on the money and we had a great experience! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Great burgers, fries and shakes coupled with great customer service!"}
{"text":"Popped in with the little guy for some animal style burgers, fries and a shake. Per usual, the staff was very friendly, the food was great and we had a good time on our day out together."}
{"text":"Double-Double Animal Style, with chopped chiles? Yes please!  Honestly, as a local, this location sucks due to too many tourists and the long wait. But, that's to be expected as well."}
{"text":"Busy, but worth the wait! Always!! The burgers are juicy and yummy, and fries are freshly cooked and always good!  Got a double double, hubby got the same but plain, and daughter got a plain cheeseburger with a chocolate milkshake! Yum! Can't go wrong with in and out!   (Was so hungry scarfed down the food and forgot to take pics! Waaah!) lol"}
{"text":"Finally an In N Out in central Phoenix. Been a loyal In N Out fan all my life. Love this place. Staff is friendly, place is clean even for being extremely busy. Love it."}
{"text":"Making it a tradition to go to In-N-Out every time I'm on the West Coast. We ordered a cheeseburger with fries and a double double with grilled onions and animal style fries. There is a bit of a wait for the food, but if that means it's going to be bomb I don't mind. The animal style fries were amazing! And the burger was just... heaven. I wish they would come to the East Coast!"}
{"text":"Really fresh burgers and fries. As far as fast food restaurants go, the burger ranks above the others. Too bad we don't have any near us. Good stuff, worth it for a quick bite to eat. I will say this location was packed but moved through the line quick, getting orders out quick too! Always a bonus!"}
{"text":"I don't normally eat fast food burgers but when I do I come here. You can't exactly call them healthy but they definitely try harder than other fast food chains with things like vegetable fry oil and lettuce wrap options and they know what they are doing when it comes to meeting food you can eat in a car. Pro tip: fast food can only be so fast and it's always busy here so be ready for a short wait. Also, if you don't see what you want on the menu, ask for it! You might be surprised."}
{"text":"My life was incomplete before I experienced he glory on In N Out Burger. I always wondered what the big deal was and now I know!!! It's amazing, incredible and delicious all at the same time!  I ordered the fries- animal style, which you need to try if you haven't yet. These were the best concoction of fast food fried I have ever had. I wish It were an option on the menu. I almost missed out until I saw it on the yelp page! I also got a cheeseburger and split a small chocolate shake. We were not able to finish all our food!"}
{"text":"This In N Out is HUGE compared to the ones I normally go to in California. It's not that far from the strip but I wouldn't walk out at night down Tropicana.   It can get very busy here and prepare to wait to order and wait for your food. Luckily I have my smartphone to keep me busy. The restaurant crowd is a mix of locals, tourists and CALIFORNIANS!!  IN N OUT is famous in California and what better to celebrate your long journey here from So Cal then having some good tasting fresh burgers and fresh cut hot fries.   Mmm... Yum!!"}
{"text":"Oh In-N-Out. Where do I begin?  The waits are long, almost 30 minutes sometimes. You do weird things like put bible verses on your packaging. Your sauce is ~mysterious~ And still, I always come back.  Five Guys and Smashburger both give you a run for your money. But to get a double-double with fries and a drink costs less money than a basic burger at those two places. Mind you, that's before the fries and the drink.  The milkshakes are Ixcacao-approved contraptions! The special sauce is probably the closest you'll ever see to me eating anything with a mayo-base. You season and blend it well enough with whatever else you use in it to take away that icky mayonnaise taste from it.  The long waits for your food show your dedication in making a quality product. The long lines show that it is indeed something worth waiting for. The fact that you, a California institution, sees Nevada as a worthy contender for expansion shows your generosity.   I practically grew up on you, In-N-Out. And for that, you'll always have my heart.   The Final Verdict  Pros: In-N-Out Quality. A local institution practically. Milkshakes to die for. A secret menu that goes on for days.  Retro decor.   Cons:  Not open 24 hours.  Might be run by religious nuts. Just saying.   Return Factor: 10/10. Well duh."}
{"text":"The double double lives up to the legend and the fries are HEAVENLY. I would seriously hurt myself if this franchise was back home in NJ."}
{"text":"I stop here occasionally, and it doesn't disappoint. In-n-out is extremely consistent. If I am in the mood for a greasy burger, then I definitely stop here. People come from all over to have the burgers here. Always a long line, but fast service. Would recommend to someone out of state."}
{"text":"No idea what happened to this place the past two months, but my bf went here tonight.   I asked him to get me the double-double with grilled onions, no tomato, no special sauce but ketchup and mustard instead.  He called me to tell me they didn't put lettuce on it, which I wasn't too fucked up about, it's only lettuce after all. Come to find out, they didn't put ketchup and mustard on it, I found TWO HAIRS cooked INTO the burger patty, so I know they weren't my boyfriends AND it WASN'T COOKED ALL THE WAY! I had to nuke it in the microwave for it to be edible.  For fucks sake, you guys used to be awesome, but I lost my appetite for this place after tonight. God damn."}
{"text":"Tastes just like you are in California....no disappointments.  The space is big enough and there is outdoor seating.  The staff is courteous and prompt.  Great experience and great food!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, great French fries, and great service for a fast food chain!  Everyone was polite and courteous, food was fresh and tasty.  We enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"In and Out- very west coast, very fatty, very much what you need after a night on the strip.  It's an institution.  It tastes like what all the fast food places were meant to taste.  Fatty, greasy, delicious!  This location has some fantastic employees.   First off, yes people here are drunk and are acting stupid.  For this alone, I would want hate to work at this location.  However, the employees were all taking people's attitudes in stride.  They had smiles and were respectful and helpful.  Further, I saw, at least, three people cleaning up tables, sweeping, etc. in the time I was there."}
{"text":"Animal Style? Squeeze me? I've been chowing down In N Out burgers for more than two decades. Yep. When Courtney had a Hole. And Friends was refreshing and not annoying. And Presidents received oral sex in the oval office. Yes, that long! But I didn't know about Animal Style on my double double...extra \"special sauce\", grilled onions, pickles all fried up in mustard on a flat girl. Um. I mean flat grill. Animal Style? Yep. I would seriously get down on all fours for this baby!"}
{"text":"In n Out well they definitely have speed and food is on another level at this location. Craving the double double and I was hungry... They fixed my hunger right before heading to the airport. The burger was hot the fries were hot. The staff got my order out fast and accurate. The price was just right. I was very pleased with this visit. If in the area again I WILL stop in as they definitely can fix hunger and cravings. Thank you for being in the right place at the right time! Respectfully, Bryan Oklahoma City"}
{"text":"Best fast food hamburger place in the country. I'm just saying...   Forget what you know about fast food places. In-N-Out Burger is a different breed. Yes, they still have order takers and drive thru windows, but that's where the similarities end. In-N-Out Burger distinguishes itself with high quality fresh food and outstanding service, all served in a sparkling clean environment. Rumor has it they only hire students with high grade point averages to assure competent employees. The difference shows.   The other thing is that they only serve three things: burgers, fries, and beverages. They don't do many things, but they do them well. The burger is 100% pure beef and served with real cheese, fresh juicy tomatoes, and hand-leafed lettuce. Plus, they make every burger one at a time, cooked to order. There isn't even a microwave or heat lamp in the building. The fries are cut in the store, one potato at a time. You can witness whole potatoes being cut as you stand at the order counter.   I don't understand why anyone would want to go to the McDonald's nearby. Maybe nobody has told them about this tasty treasure just down the street?"}
{"text":"You can't beat In N Out Burger when it comes to burgers. They also have a SECRET menu that you can only find on line or from a friend."}
{"text":"Be a piggie and go animal on everything :)  This place is delicious, but definitely only an occasional thing over an everyday occurrence :) unless you enjoy cardiac surgery?"}
{"text":"OH HOLY HE[double hockey stick]  Best cure for a hangover ever.    This place is right off the strip so it's kind of too far to walk to, but you can see it right over the highway.  In & Out is what some would consider Las Vegas's Chick-fil-A [since we don't have one of these fine establishments].  It's ALWAYS packed at whatever time you will get there. So be prepared to wait in line and wait a bit for your meal.  Sometimes you even have to wait for a seat so you can actually enjoy your cardiac arrest on a platter!  one pattie, fries and a drink is plenty for me...but I know some people go hog wild. If you also get the 'special sauce' on the side and/or just get ketchup/mustard it saves you like 10 grams of fat [all the nutritional info is on their website]  I just wish they served beer. Beer 'n Burgers it just goes together."}
{"text":"Best burgers ever. Hands down....The food, service, and quality are always consistent and amazingly great. You could eat off the floor of the restaurants if you wanted to."}
{"text":"I guess I've been hiding under a rock. I'm from the Midwest and have been living in AZ for four years and decided to give this place a try yesterday. Good customer service, good prices, and good food! I just went back today (don't judge me lol); the burgers and fries are fresh, & I don't feel \"weighed down\" after eating here. When it comes to the menu, less is definitely better. I will be back! :)"}
{"text":"I know in and out is a busy place to get food generally, but when you are told the total four times instead of being asked if that's all you will be ordering today, it gets kind of annoying and frustrating. Especially when you get interrupted multiple times during the ordering process and half way through the order someone with a tablet try's to finish your order and again just tells you the total when you are still trying to order. I know the line has to move, but I have more people in the car who also want to spend money and get food as well. As for the food, it's ok. The fries are usually soggy and aren't great compared to other fast food places. And the burgers are average. I honestly don't see the hype of this place."}
{"text":"I come to this In N Out every time I fly into Phoenix for work. It's not much different from any other In N Out, which is why I love it. The burgers are fresh, simple and delicious. If you want to add a twist, check out their secret menu online. I always go Animal Style now..."}
{"text":"I think what I liked most about this In-N-Out location was the party in the parking lot.   A constant stream of taxis disgorge all elements of the Vegas experience, pre-, during-, and post-party.  Here we are at 7pm getting a snack before our night begins, and these lovely sparkly hoochies are closing down their 36-hour night with some food before they sleep the sleep of the damned.  It's all good."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and every time I do go the food is mediocre. On three separate occasions I received a raw ass burger with my meals which is disgusting this is the only in n out who can't make me a burger that isn't raw to save their life. I only gave it 2 stars because their animal fries be on point but other then that the food is garbage."}
{"text":"First my husband asked for sauce on the fries didn't receive any . Secondly he got a hamburger and it was literally a patty with meat , nothing else . We went in but asked for it to go . The service was fast but only because they half assed everything .. Not coming back"}
{"text":"This is a great chain, we love this place. Simple menu, but all the classics are good!"}
{"text":"I didn't eat fast food for the past 10 years and I broke my streak after hearing so much good stuff about this place. It's not the most amazing burger I had in my life but it sure is the top amongst fast food burgers. I also tried bachi burger in Vegas and I have to say I would much rather prefer an In-N-Out monster burger (they add a special sauce when you request for it monster style-- it's not on menu). You probably need two to get you full though."}
{"text":"Myla took our order tonight and from the start I loved her. She is so great and personable. She definitely deserves to be manager with her attitude!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Took Parker there for lunch today and  they were so sweet to the kids and our burgers were delicous!!"}
{"text":"The hamburgers and shakes are fresh and very good and the people that work here all seem to be helpful and nice.  I'd give them 5 stars but it's the drive to get into here on a busy Saturday that is awful. Someone did not think that through...  Thank goodness they send an order taker out to take your order ahead of time."}
{"text":"As a In-N-Out fan after a big party weekend it was the perfect lunch for a long trip coming back home. It is always worth it yummy!!!!! We had to wait for a long queue and take a table before asking for the food (poor lonely me waiting for the food) but even though we had to wait a while it was super worth it! Always is! The fries are awesome and naturals! I have no words for this food and experience :P Good and quick service."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm in n out burger ^_^ soooo good. Simple menu and pricing couldn't be easier :)  The burgers are delicious everytime :) and the fries are good as well. Service is fast and speedy. And they're always busy haha, which is not a bad thing :)  Always look forward to eating here coming from hawaii :)   Just this last time we ate there was a little uncomfortable, we ate outside and there we kids running around and it was scary watching them running into the drive in lane when there were on coming cars.  I know it's not the restaurants fault, but they should atleast watch or something, cause that was really dangerous. More the parents fault though lol.  The food is good though :) just got to wash the tables and sweep a little better. Ketchup on the table still and fries on the floor and chairs is not something customers want to sit in or next to lol :)  Be back again though :)"}
{"text":"I love this place . Best burger you can get for the price. They are always really busy and the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Keeping this short because that seems to the the theme of in-n-out anyway...  I'm not sure why everyone hypes this place up. The staff is great but the entire concept and menu just... sucks.  Yes, the point is to get in, get your burger and get out, but they do nothing better or more quick than McDonalds, Burger King, Jack in the Box or Wendy's and yet they have an infinitely smaller menu.  What makes them so special? Yes the 4-item me unis intended to keep things quick, but again, it moves no faster than other fast food places so why not just go somewhere else where you have more options...?  My family and I were really disappointed by this place and hopefully at least the food was great or something, which would help to make it better than other burger joints, but that's not even the case. I'd eat a Whopper or a Big Mac before I'd eat a burger from in n out AND I don't even necessarily like those."}
{"text":"Best meal I had all weekend.  Can't stop thinking about it.  Pissed I don't have one closer than 5 hours away.  Does anyone have the secret recipe for animal fries?"}
{"text":"Oh how I love in n out burger.  I try to rarely go due to the high health content of their food and the fact that I no longer live in a state without one.  I do enjoy animal style fries and animal style burgers though.  For a fast food burger place this is one of the best."}
{"text":"Ok, so I would have orginally given them four stars. Really, I was such a fan of theirs. Lately I've noticed that even though they may have fresh burgers, a 'cool' 'secret' menu (that everyone knows about) they have quite a few problems that have been adding up to my annoyance over the years. I've lived right up the street from this place for 18 years, so I was there when it first opened up (and it was a big deal to the community, no more shall we have to drive down to Lake Mead!) and have seen them develop over the years. 1.) Service has gotten worse, the wait time is ridiculous, and to make it more of an insult they have an actual timer for you to watch while you wait. This applies to when it is busy (which I can understand to a POINT- fifteen minutes at the LAST window? Not cool) and when you  come at 11pm at night and wait 10 minutes for your fries and milkshake. I'm sorry, but it has gotten ridiculous over the years, the amount of waiting I have to do inside and outside (inside is worse by the way) so much so that when I went to one in San Francisco (one that had TWO lines by the way) I expected to wait half an hour, but it turned out it took less time to get us through there than it does here at this location when there is only one person in front of you. So it is not an overall In N Out issue, it is THIS place's issue. 2.) Prices have gone way up. End of story. 3.) It is not unresonable to ask for a grilled cheese to be grilled away from the burgers, on the other grill. Escpecially not when there is an actual option for it. So when I ask, and I find meat chunks on my grilled cheese, I know you did not, in fact, grill it on the other grill. This ties into a very important reason why I no longer come to this location: They rarely listen to what you want, if it is outside of the \"Double Double no onions\" deal. More cheese? Maybe. No salt on your fries? Perhaps. Half strawberry half chocolate milkshake? Kinda. If they can't hold up to their 'secret' menu, then they should not have it as an option. Other locations are way better."}
{"text":"This place is great, friendly staff like always! They would get higher stars but I hate waiting in lines. Clearly it's not their fault but it still takes away from the experience"}
{"text":"My husband is a huge fan of In n Out Burger and since they stick to letting us on the East coast suffer by not bringing the chain closer than Las Vegas we make a visit any time there is one in town.  In Vegas you get tired of fancy eating after a while, even more when you have Joel Robuchon on your list for the week of restaurants. So In n Out came as a welcomed relaxed, smacking good meal.  My husband had already advised me that taxis go in and out of In n Out all the time, so we let our taxi go not before having been told by about three locals, \"oh, your going to get real good food now\" of course when we came back to the hotel and they saw me with my drink cup all the valet people asked what we had brought them from In n Out.  It is no coincidence that In n Out is so famous.  They use really good clean oil for their fries which come out, without fault, light yellow and crispy.  For ladies I suggest the single burger and for guys the Double Double. The Monster Fries are not on the menu, as are about 7 other articles, that are secret knowledge of only the  real fans of the chain restaurant. We had the monsters last time, which are like a double dose of fries drenched in their special pink sauce which they also put on their burgers, I think. I'll have to ask the hubby for the real story.  Milk shakes are pretty, darn thick I should have done without those calories, but heck I won't be having one of those for a while now.  Two empty taxis came in exactly when we were about to leave. Perfect!"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with my experience after I heard great things about this place. The menu was very limited with only three burger options. My burger was pink, bread was hard and my fries were cold. The fries taste worse than McDonald's fries when they get cold."}
{"text":"I miss In-N-Out since I've moved to the east coast. This place can never do wrong in my book. The staff were friendly and accommodating. I love the french fries, cooked fresh from a fresh cut potato. Don't forget to check out the hidden menu."}
{"text":"People have been telling me for ages and eons that the holy grail of burger place is In-N-Out Burger. I've been drooling and salivating every, single, time when people describe to me the incredible taste of a Double Double. Being in Florida, I'm sh*t out of luck to have a taste, and I always finding myself ending up at a burger place, wondering how sh*tty the burger is that I'm shoving into my mouth, comparing to what I can get at In-N-Out.  FINALLY! First time to Vegas and this is THE first spot I hit!  The line for the food is literally out the door. I think the entire Las Vegas population is waiting to get a burger at this place. Frustrating? Yes, but I waited in line and let my hunger build, while wondering if I should order 5 or 20 of these legendary Double Doubles.  In the end I chickened out and just got 2 with a side of cheesy fries.  Man o man, the fries SUCKED. They are cold and soggy and everything not nice.   As for the burger, it was pretty good but not great. It's just about as good as a regular cheese burger that you can get at other similar places. (Actually it reminded me a lot of Steak N' Shake's burger)   I was really let down. I was told by many others who swears by In-N-Out that I was cheated at the Las Vegas location, and should give it another try when I'm actually in California.  We'll see...."}
{"text":"The food is always great! I just don't like how unsanitary it is in here. The tables are not wiped down and there is trash on the ground everywhere"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a 3x3 and it was well worth the wait. As an east coaster, this is always a treat."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a McDonald's alternative, I would say this place is better than McDonalds, BurgerKing etc. I would not say this place is any healthier for you. Its a fast food burger place no different than Checkers. The fries are NEVER cooked all the way, they bring them to you looking VERY oily, and you will not find them crisp or done (as this is a fast food place and they want things moving as fast as possible). The food quality isnt terrible, but this is NOTHING to get excited over. THIS IS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER FAST FOOD PLACE, WITH AVERAGE TASTING FOOD, AND FRIES THAT ARE UNCOOKED.  If you're running late and have NO other options, stop by to eat, other than that, NOTHING SPECIAL..."}
{"text":"Obviously in-n-out has definitely been a staple in my diet and im pretty sure every other american as well lol! But since I track my macros its ok! Anyways I get the same thing all the time 1. 4 x 4 animal style extra grilled onion, extra extra extra extra mustard fried, no lettuce n no tomato 2. I usually get a regular french fry but if im really hungry I get animal style 3. Depending on my hinge level I get a Neapolitan shake  Yes, the caloric value of this is extremely high but its innout I love tho place!  Estephanie, dulce, and nigel are all amazing! They already know what I want and exactly how I want it. They are so polite and awesome! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Service is GREAT!!  But I'm not a fan...not a fan at all...Wendy's is still my fav.... I'm just saying.... I don't really like or am impressed with In N Out ..."}
{"text":"Went thru drive thru around 12:15. Almost fell asleep i waited so long in my car...I wasn't hungry anymore ...just sleepy the girl at window her name was Brenna was so cool and even at almost 1am was apologizing about the wait and sitting in drive thru I was watching young kitchen staff bust their butt...to top it off I reversed a bit to get a snap chat of the menu and set off speaker and pulled right up and two seconds later with menu iPad a young male came out to be sure everyone had their order not skipped it over looked.... GREAT STAFF!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't see the hype!   I'd go to smash burger before in n out if I wanted a quick burger!  The cus service however is AMAZING, always accurate and speedy!"}
{"text":"I went in Saturday night around 9pm... My food was as always consistently perfect.  The gentleman Jesus took my order with eye contact and a smile then repeated it back to confirm and asked if I wanted to add on fries .....now I've worked in the food and beverage industry since 1998 (19 years) and this guy nailed every step for service and was so polished and kind.   I really enjoy In N Out but I'll go to this location rather than Trop just because of his guest service and the other people making the food and presenting it.   If I ever ever ran a business of my own I would follow in the founder of In N Out's foot steps because every since time I visit any location all the staff are smiling, happy, with perfectly clean and tailored uniforms and most important the food is always on point consistent ....Hands down AMAZING!   Thanks again Jesus....it's rare when ordering dinner I actually get spoken to and looked directly in the eyes with a true smile."}
{"text":"Visited the one between the linq and flamingo. Very busy, but they are very organized and the wait was minimal. I was on a burger hunt all over VEGAS to find  The best burger, and IN and OUT has always been on my bucket list. The burger itself was actually very good, not the best I've ever had, but in the top 10 for sure! The personnel were extremely nice, and the service was great considering it's a fast food joint. I was disappointed in the fries, but everywhere I go lately, the fries just don't deliver, so I can't deduct points, to be fair! Overall a great experience and the price $$$ was the best I encountered in VEGAS on the strip! Will definitely return"}
{"text":"The only thing I get from in-n-out is vanilla milk shakes. This location makes them nice and thick; which is how it should be. The only thing I was not please with was waiting for 10 minutes on an order when I was the only one inside the restaurant. I get that the drive-thru was busy but maybe I came at the wrong time."}
{"text":"I only get vanilla milk shakes at in-n-out. For some reason the one I got here was very runny and not thick. I would venture to say that it was not mixed long enough. This location is dirtier than others but it does have a nice outdoor seating patio."}
{"text":"Always amazing food and service. The kid's that work here are always so friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Just got home and started eating my burger. Almost half way through, and I thought jeez, this patty may have fallen way down. Nope. No patty!!!!! So sad. Order mess ups are expected every once in a while from McDonald's or Taco Bell, but in n out? Guess so!"}
{"text":"AMAZING. Still in awe as to how a burger is less than $4. There's a lot of people at this location so it can get quite hectic, but they take care of the line pretty well. Get the fries well done and animal style."}
{"text":"In n Out has never disappointed me (after I found out about \"fries well done\" that is...). For those who just don't understand the hype, it's very simple. Fresh, high quality ingredients. Doesn't taste frozen because it isn't (even the buns, cheese and veggies taste much better than other cheap eating options). The service is outstanding, probably because they pay more than other fast food joints. Now, I will say that the food is very good taken home or back to the office, but to truly experience it's greatness, it should be eaten immediately at the restaurant or in your car in the parking lot (so the toasted bun and everything else is crisp vs. soggy). It really makes a huge difference!"}
{"text":"Boy I gotta tell ya - what a HUGE disappointment this place was. I've been dieting for the last 5 months and have finally reached my goal - and then some, so I decided to treat myself (good behavior) and have some fast food. At first I thought Wendy's until I saw that famous In-N-Out sign and pulled right in. The service was impeccable, the food? Not so much. I ordered the single cheeseburger with fries and a root beer. The bun on my burger was greasier than the burger itself - I could barely hold on to it! The fries  -  although hot  -  we're as dry as cardboard and actually tasted like cardboard...even my root beer was weak - how the heck can you screw up a root beer?!?! Five months of hard work and my reward completely and totally sucked. Thanks...I really should have gone to Wendy's - well, next time!"}
{"text":"I only have eight more weeks before I go back to being a vegetarian again and I wanted to make sure I didn't skip this place. They stay open until 1:30 on Friday and Saturday nights and we made it here at 1:10 AM.  There was a long line in the drive-thru... there must have been at least eight cars in front of us but the line moved pretty quickly. We were out by 1:25... so not too bad considering the long line.  I had the number two which was the cheeseburger, fries, and drink combo. My boyfriend had the number one which was the double double, fries, and drink combo and he got his fries \"animal style\". I usually eat the fries first, I like it nice and fresh and hot. I waited one time to eat it after the burger and it didn't taste as good. But that's just me. By the way, I can't take a bite from my burger and then fries and then burger again. I like to eat one food at a time so I can really taste it and enjoy it without the interference of other foods coming into the mix. Get what I'm saying? LOL. The burger was good too but I admit, it was no longer hot by the time I got to it.  The young lady who was at the window spoke so fast! My boyfriend and I looked at each other like...  whoa!   The next time we come here, I will most likely be a vegetarian by then. So instead of ordering a burger, I'll just order their grilled cheese which is not on the menu, but you always can ask for it.  Oh, I almost forgot this part... I thought it was cute when the guy who took our order asked if it was to go. Ummm.. yes!  We're ordering from the drive-thru! The boyfriend and I had a good chuckle. :)"}
{"text":"All In-N-Out Burgers are amazing as far as I'm concerned but this one stood out to me for their exceptional service. I didn't catch the managers name but he was very involved with the customers and you could tell he keeps his employees positive and motivated to do a great job. The manager alone made our visit today extra special. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Always friendly and great food but the person working the last window through the drive-through messed up....he just gave me my order and didn't repeat back what it was and seemed in a hurry to do something else than take the time for the customer at the drive-through. Otherwise I would have given them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Still not in love. Tried it many times and the fries are plain and the burger is ok for fast food but doesn't keep me coming back. Sorry to the diehard fans, but I think there are better burger joints out there."}
{"text":"Easy enough to get to from the highway.  Stopped here on my way home from Vegas.  Place was packed but moved fast.  Normal great in n out food.  Attached to a merchandise store so lost of space to park and eat."}
{"text":"I don't know if tonight if the cooks were just didn't want to be here or what but all 3 burgers I received in my order were still raw. I noticed mine was a little pink but my brother's burger and his wife's burger were really pink.  I love in n out burgers but this is a first for me and I'm used to a quality of service and tonight didn't meet that quality in n out usually delivers."}
{"text":"There is no need for any of the gourmet burger joints in town so long as In-N-Out is around. For two bucks and change, an animal style burger from here beats anything Kerry Simon, Hubert Keller or anyone else in this town is doing with their meat.  I do think that INO fries taste like cardboard unless I ask for them cooked light. But that's the beauty of INO, they will undercook your fries if you want. They will overcook your fries if you want. Hell, they'll probably serve them to you in a hair net if you ask nicely.  Great staff, 100% order accuracy on every visit in 3 years. I sometimes whine about the lack of decent restaurant options in the Dead Hooker Burial Ground part of SW Vegas, but really I should just shut up and come here."}
{"text":"Okay so for those of you from California like myself In-N-Out is not something that you freak out for or feel like you have to drive all over town bypassing many other burger joints to eat.... Wait, that is exactly what most California transplants do. I have to say I just don't get it. We happened to be doing In-N-out burger for lunch at work today and I was going to pass and just grab something from the bakery next door but I decided to see just how unlike in n out I could make the burger and well.... It worked. They made my burger exactly how I asked for it, a double double, mustard grilled, with chopped hot peppers.. Yes I said chopped hot peppers and animal style.   Now that you have swallowed that In-N-Out put hot peppers on my burger I will just put it out there. In-n-Out is Ov-er-rated. The burgers are not anything that stands out as being all to spectacular and the fries even when you request well done fries so they come out crispy instead of mushy they are still lack luster. My recommendation would be to take out a personal loan from your bank and hit up the nearest fat burger.    Basically it is safe to say that if you have never been to an in-n-out you may want to try it to build your own opinion but it is nothing that really makes me say wow. But if you happen to be a straight cheeseburger enthusiast and don't like any of the extras that you can get at most other places this might be for you."}
{"text":"Burger & fries! Enjoy all the time.  We stop by every time we're visiting Arizona since we don't have one in New Mexico.  The sauce on their burgers are delicious."}
{"text":"Cheap? Check. Fast? Check Tasty? Checkity Check  In-N-Out locations in Dallas? DENIED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  To quote 90's icons Beavis and Butthead, \"That is the suckiest suck that ever sucked!\""}
{"text":"Decided to come here for lunch today...back on the low carb kick so I went with some lettuce wrapped Double Doubles.  They really do hook up the lettuce here in the lettuce wrap.  These burgers had like 6 extra lettuce leaves wrapped around them.  I just discarded them to the side and chowed down.  The burgers were great as always.  Hot, fresh, inexpensive and delicious.  Service was friendly although a little weird.  The girl at the register wouldn't really look me in the face.  She kept peering over my shoulder like she was talking with the person behind me (even though there was nobody behind me).  Can she see ghosts?  Fucking rad if she can!  It wasn't a lazy eye either.  It was just a bit odd.  At least she got my semi unorthodox order correct the first time (lettuce wrap, no tomato, no spread, both kinds of onions).  This place is 1 mile from work so I'm sure I will be back.  Can't really beat In N Out!"}
{"text":"Finally!  Surprise does not have many \"good\" restaurants, but that is slowly changing for the better.  Hence, In N Out!  Closest one previously was down Bell near Arrowhead.  Quite a drive for some In N Out.  With this one open now, it's only a 10 minute drive from my house.  Score!  Decided to have my 40th Birthday dinner here last night.  Went with my usual of a 3x3 with regular and grilled onions only, an order of fries, and a Coke.  Cashier was friendly and they had workers coming around asking if you needed anything and if everything tasted alright.  Burger was delicious as usual, and the fries were really good tonight too (not always the case with In N Out fries).  They were perfectly cooked, closer to well done, but not burnt, and tasted fantastic.    I am super happy that this is finally here.  I will be back often!  Best thing to happen to Surprise in awhile!"}
{"text":"Shit....In N Out is always good, but some are just a little bit better than others.    We came here the other day for lunch.  I went with a Double Double, both kinds of onions and we got some fries to split (mostly for my son).  It was a cheap lunch.  2 Double Doubles, an order of fries and a soda was only $11.50.  Not too bad for a lunch for 3.    The burgers here were pretty delicious as usual but something was just a tad off with them.  I think they were more skimp on the onions, and the cheese wasn't melted and molten hot as usual.  The fries were a little bit overdone and crispy too.  I still gobbled everything up, but it didn't totally satisfy my In N Out craving like it normally does.  This In N Out is also in a semi inconvenient corner location.  If you are going East on Bell, make a right on 83rd, then bust a U turn and make sure to go almost all the way back to Bell in order to get into their parking lot.  I busted a bitch and pulled in a lot thinking it was their parking lot or that I could drive around to get into their parking lot, but you can't.  I wound up parking in the next lot over and walking over to In N Out.  Just a minor inconvenience.   I'm sure I will eventually come back to this one if I am ever in the area craving some In N Out.  It's the closest one to my house in Surprise.  I would come here over the one in Avondale (Worst In N Out I have had outside of the Goleta, CA location), but I would hit up the one near my work in Deer Valley over this one any day (That one is the best In N Out I have had in Arizona, yet)!"}
{"text":"We are taking a little staycation in Chandler, and the wife wanted some In-N-Out.  This place was right down the street from our hotel, so we decided to have dinner here last night.  I went with my usual order of a 3x3 with just meat, cheese, raw AND grilled onions.  Had an order of fries, too.  My wife got a Double Double, my son had a plain cheeseburger and we got our daughter a grilled cheese (her first time at an In-N-Out).  Lady at the counter was very nice and super smiley.  Food was great.  There have only been a few times where I was disappointed with In-N-Out.  99.9% of the time, it is always bomb!  Tonight it was great!  Burgers were great (nothing better than that hot, molten, American cheese running down your chin/hands) and the fries were hooked up!  Sometimes you get your boat of fries and it's barely filled to the top.  These fries tonight were overflowing and delicious.  They even tasted great after they cooled down (rare for In-N-Out fries) a bit!    Overall, super happy we stopped here for dinner.  To feed all 4 of us, it was only $20.00!  Service and staff was friendly, and the food was delicious!  I am not down this way often, but if I am ever in the area and want a burger, I would definitely come back to this In-N-Out!"}
{"text":"Yo......  I love In N Out.  I think they are the most consistent place out there, they are inexpensive, fresh and tasty.  That applies for most of them.....this is only the 2nd time out of probably 100s of times that I have been to an In N Out and was not completely impressed.  I placed my usual order of a Double Double with no tomato, both kinds of onions, and an order of fries.  Had a water to drink.  A little over $5.50.  Service was friendly but the food was \"off\".  My burger was not piping hot....the patties were warm but not hot.  The spread was also \"off\".  I could taste a huge hint of mayo in the spread.  I know its made with mayo but they usually blend/cut that shit so well with the ketchup and relish, you never even get a hint of mayo taste.  I had more than a few bites with straight mayo taste.  It was not good at all.  The produce seemed a little off too.  The onions had a weird \"bite\" to them.  Besides the Goleta In N Out, this was the worst In N Out Burger that I have had.  The fries were pretty good as usual.  Nothing wrong there.  I'm pretty sure I will not come back to this particular one.  The only reason I came here was that it was the closest In N Out to where I was at the time.  Ill drive a few miles up the road and hit up a different one next time."}
{"text":"This was my third time trying In-N-Out and my opinion about it is still the same. Not really my preferred burger.  I got the number one, which is a double-double with fries and a drink. Got the burger animal style, of course, which means they cooks onions and mustard into the burger. Burger was fine-thinner patties, lots of lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles. I was pretty full after eating the burger.   The fries were not the greatest....imagine really thick potato sticks. They didn't taste like normal french fries. They were fine, just not for me.   I would eat In-N-Out if it were someone else's choice, but I wouldn't choose it."}
{"text":"In-N-Out Burger: Delusions of Grandeur.  If I was given the option to live off of one food for the rest of my life, it would probably be a cheeseburger. It's the one and only food I feel justified reviewing. So let me tell you this: If Shake Shack and McDonalds had a baby, it would be named In-N-Out.  There's a lot of hype surrounding this place, but not quite enough taste to back it up. Don't get me wrong, it's good...REALLY good for the price...but it's not in the same conversation as Shake Shack or Five Guys. It's just too \"fast foody\", if you will.   If you're visiting the West Coast: GET IT. Get the double-double with Animal Style fries. But don't set your expectations too high, as you will probably be disappointed.    P.S. The best burger I had in Vegas was one from Wolfgang Puck's bar and grill at the MGM Grand...if you're nearby for lunch or dinner and you're a burger aficionado, it's a must have."}
{"text":"I just can't get enough of this place - the burgers are incredibly consistent; and consistently incredible.  And all three of the restaurants that I've frequented are always clean - in and out.  It's a pure pleasure to just sit there and watch them work - every employee is smiling and they're smiling the whole time whether they're serving customers or slicing potatoes into fries.  I don't know how they do it - it's a real mystery to me how they can find so many clean, well-mannered employees that can be in such a good mood ALL THE TIME.   There are problems that sometimes arise - for instance, some customers will trash a table and it'll take them a while to notice it, but one word from a customer, or a guest as they call us, and they jump into action, smiling while they clean it up.  In other fast food joints, you can't even get employees to act like they care, but It really seems like each and every one of their employees here are really trying to do the best job they can, not just acting.  I know this is just fast food, but it's fast food at it's very best and it is appreciated."}
{"text":"In-N-Out burger. Oh its one of the go to spots when I am in Vegas. its In-n-out. Sonic & Mens Coach Factory outlet. Btw, this is the less sketchy in-n-out burger location. The other one near the strip isn't so great.  The taste has never changed since I remember the first time eating here many many years ago, which is a good thing!  I got me a 3x3 and animal style fries. Oh boy was I in calorie Heaven!  Everything was fresh as they can be. The fries was piping hot. The burger literally just came off the grill.  I have to try the milk shake since that's what everyone keeps on raving about and I'll go over the top and add grilled onions.  I will keep on coming back and visiting this location every time i'm in town!  oh btw, there was this hella cute white boy with a birth mark / mole on his face either operating the deep frier for the fries or putting the animal style condiments on the fries on Sunday, June 26, at about  4pm. Add me on Facebook! www.facebook.com/edgarmadrid"}
{"text":"We had this on our list to do for our first Vegas experience (we don't have In-N-Out on the east coast).  I have to say I was disappointed in the experience.  Given the fact that we were starving after a 5 hour flight plus hotel check in experience, I would have thought we would have enjoyed it more.  Instead, I found myself comparing it to the east coast Five Guys burgers, which are an up and coming burger chain.  The burger was OK, but not great.  It seemed a little dry and bland.  I did enjoy the fries more than the burger.  Maybe this is a coastal difference?  None of the 4 people who went thought it was anything other than a fast food burger/fries, which surprises me given the plethora of postive ratings."}
{"text":"Busy location, allow some time, food is good, same price as McD's but real beef hamburgers and better fries."}
{"text":"So many Burger Places So Little Time......We LOVED In and Out Burger So Much that we SKIPPED our visit to Paradise Bakery & Cafe! GREAT BURGER AND EVEN BETTER FRIES.........Our 1st Visit was at 10:30 PM on a Weeknight and the Place was Busy!  People eating inside and outside...and lots of Cars in the Drive Through Waiting to place Orders To Go..... Can't wait to return during our next visit to AZ:):)"}
{"text":"I am a huge In-N-Out fan and eat here regularly. All ingredients are fresh, never frozen, which comes through in the quality of the product. Often called \"fast food\", INO rises above the rest. Associates are always friendly and eager to help customers with anything they may need. I'll recommend INO to anyone, even vegetarians! INO has a delicious grilled cheese that comes with everything that comes on a burger (except the meat!). If you havent yet, give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Four of us in town after the Super Bowl popped into In-N-Out Burger for a quick dinner before a show. There were only a handful of people in line when we walked in. Based on past experience, I ordered a medium rare cheese burger, animal style with chopped chilies, well done fries and a regular soda. My burger was a flavorful, multi-napkin requiring, mess showing just a bit of pink just as specified. The fries were crisp and savory. I mixed their lemonade with iced tea to make a Pink Arnold Palmer which turned out pretty well actually.  The Twin Cities are a true hot spot for burgers. We have numerous national and local chains as well as many excellent independent establishments. Not to mention being the birthplace of the Jucy Lucy (See: Matt's Bar in Mpls.). Would an In-N-Out Burger be a welcome addition to the scene? Sure. Am I dying for one to open? Nah. I'll enjoy them when I'm out west. That works just fine for me."}
{"text":"Five Stars for a fast food burger chain?  Spring Break, 1974...I was a senior in college and my girlfriend, Susie, had more money than good sense (as evidenced by the fact that she was my girlfriend:)  The answer to her question \"what do you want to do for spring break?\" was \"let's take your new car and drive to LA and party on your credit cards!!!:)\"  That's where I had my first In-n-Out Burger after seeing bumper stickers and license plate frames everywhere around LA that said \"In-n-Out  urge \":) So hilarious, so \"in your face\"...just a little bit dirty...for 1974:)  I finally asked somebody where to get such a cool and in your face bumper sticker (that'll show the man:) and I found out about In-n-Out and fell in love...no, no...not with Susie:)  I got my license plate frame... properly defaced it and for I while, I was the guy showin' the man:)  Fast forward to San Ramon, CA in 1999 and In-n-Out opens its first NorCal store 9 miles from my house, with 3 hour drive through waits, police traffic control, news helicopters and all the rest, as tens of thousands of people flooded into San Ramon to get their \"In-N-Out  urge\" fulfilled:)...  Pizzeria Bianco like waits to pungle up your $5 for a burger, fries and coke...whiskey tango foxtrot! (at least you can get In-n-Out to make your burger the way you want it:)  What inspires this kind of mob rush?  * Is it the cool red and white packaging, with the crossed palm trees (and little inscriptions like \"John 3:16\" and \"Proverbs 3:5 printed in certain spots on the packaging)?  * Is it the special secret (or not so secret) menu?...The Beautiful Carin always gets her burger \"Animal style, Protein Style\" ...I get my burgers \"mustard grilled with extra toast\" and we always get the fries \"Well Done\":)  * Is it the simplicity of In-n-Out...they do burgers and fries...just burgers and fries...they do them pretty much any way you can think of...but they just do burgers and fries...simple and elegant:)  * Is it the quality control they exercise over their stores? They do not franchise and they do not open a store more than 1 days drive from their warehouses in LA. They make certain that the ingredients are fresh (no frozen beef) and quality standards are equally high throughout the chain.  * Is it in how they treat their employees? Everything I hear is that In-n-Out is the best fast food chain to work for, consistently paying more than MickieD's, Wendy's and the rest.  I think it's the combination of all those things...  What I do know is that they never get my order wrong, the people at In-n-Out are always happy to see me and friendly to me and the burgers and fries are always the best of any fast food chain (OK, not the best drive through burger in town...and you know who you are Lucky Boy:)   So when the \"In-n-Out urge\" strikes, swing through In-n-Out Burger and get yourself a 3x3, mustard grilled, extra toast, a side of fries well done, and an extra large shake...  That'll satisfy at least one of your In-n-Out urges...I can't help you with the other ones:)"}
{"text":"Don't. Inside and the drive thru were packed. I don't understand the hype. Hubby got a burger. Patties look the size of a McDonalds burger. No wonder it's inexpensive. He even said they weren't like they use to be decades ago. I ate some fries. Didn't like them."}
{"text":"I grew up with In-N-Out Burger and they are how I judge all other burgers.  Not a real extensive menu and that is the way I like it.  And, every single time I go to any In-N-Out, they are busy, which says a lot about their standards.  Anyhow, this review is just for my last visit.   I pull up to this location and the drive-thru was busy, so I went inside to order.  There was a small line but it was moving quickly.  Getting to the front of the line, I was greeted and my order was taken.  Within 5 minutes my order was ready.  I got in and out within 10 minutes.  Then I got home and crushed the burgers.    It is really easy to cross off the deadly sin of gluttony at In-N-Out burger."}
{"text":"My introduction to In-N-Out. On a cross-country trip, daughter, a big fan of I-N-O, said we had to stop. This was a good experience, a very good shake and a fair burger. Burger a little thin, but typical of all fast food drive-thru; ala the BIG MAC. This burger had lots of flavor and didn't have the taste cooked out. This particular location has good drive-thru access and a nice parking lot to stop, eat and walk the dog."}
{"text":"I must say I've always wanted to try this chain but being an east coaster it makes it a little complicated.   So here I find myself in the phoenix area with a flat tire at a gas station on my way to Frank Lloyd Wrigh place and I look across the street and I could surely use a burger!!!  Well hello can you be any cleaner? First impressions were pretty impressive right there.  Of course one who has never partaken doesn't have a clue what fo order it's a good thing one brings the hubs to clue her into animal style burger.   And so it was that with my lemonade ready I take my first bite and wonder why it is we don't have one of these in NJ?  Why o why?  I may need to move."}
{"text":"Every time when I'm waiting for my burger and fries they ask if I have been helped they have really good customer service and good burgers and Secret sauce"}
{"text":"People, what is the hype about  In-N-Out Burger? I don't get it. The line wound through the parking lot and practically into the street. Order takers were approaching cars. I thought I was about to get something special and was astounded at how BLAH my burger was. No real seasonings, nothing special in the condiments. The fries were fine, but I am seriously underwhelmed.  A burger from here is not worth standing in line. Sorry."}
{"text":"The burgar use to be 3 times thicker than it is now.  There is no taste to the sandwich And the meat is paper thin and crunchy. Very disapointed."}
{"text":"Solid burger enough said. If you have never been then slap yourself in the face ... Or at least get off couch and go try one."}
{"text":"am so glad that In/Out is 5mins away from where I live! its the bomb especially for late nite snack :) Love the fries/their fresh veggies and the friendly staff.."}
{"text":"Way too slow. I thought I would get a quick burger but it was way slow. Not really ready to serve food when they opened this morning. I was trying to have a fast snack but got stuck in drive thru jail.15 minutes is way too long"}
{"text":"i love everything here, the fresh fries, the burgers...yummmmmmm"}
{"text":"Is it overhyped? I've been to In-N-Out a few times since moving to the states, and I've always been satisfied with my meal.   People certainly love this place, and it really has a huge following. Students, in particular, are devotees of this chain. The prices are renowned for being affordable as well. The question then, is whether the taste meets expectations.  Food: This place doesn't make me feel sick after eating. I think that in itself makes it a winner. I'm not a huge fast-foodie, but when I do go out, I'm willing to grab a burger here. The burgers aren't massive, but they're flavourful. You don't need a ton of sauce to make one their patties appetizing. You can ask for onions, but don't. The onions here are strong and will light your intestines on fire for the rest of the day.  Fries are good, and it's fun to watch them chop the potatoes up with that massive fry-slicing machine.   Service: I've always had good service, which is impressive given that they're always incredibly busy.   You can always find a better burger joint, but for a fast-food burger place, In-N-Out is my go-to."}
{"text":"I've only had In-N-Out Burger a handful of times now since I didn't have it growing up nor do I have one close to where I live now.  I get it anytime I can as I love this place too much.  The menu is simple, yet fresh, affordable, and oh so good.  This location is particular was extremely busy when I visited, but the staff was friendly and quick to keep the line moving and customers happy.  My parents and I ordered the cheeseburger and fries combo.  Personally, I make my burger and fries animal style, so do yourself a favor and do the same. :)  Yeah, it's not the BEST burger I've ever had, but for the quality and price, you can't beat this place."}
{"text":"So about once every 2-3 months I get a craving that only In n Out can satisfy. A # 2 or # 3 Animal Style with grilled AND fresh onions, with a root beer to drink. Occasionally I'll order the fries well done but usually just let them cook them normally.   Ohhh man...while not the best burger ever, when given the choice of fast food burger joints I will choose In n Out at least  90% of the time.   This location is one of the newest in the Valley and conveniently located off I-17 on the North side of Peoria Ave.  The service is as friendly and professional as any of their other locations."}
{"text":"I'm far from a regular burger eater but every now and then in and out really hits the spot. I love my burger animal style with the grilled onions and sauce - there's a whole secret menu out there somewhere even. A great thing about in and out is that it's like Starbucks in regards to consistency. Once you have something you like, it will pretty much be the same everywhere."}
{"text":"It's good. Overrated. Just a sandwhich. Which I'll gladly eat. Not a big deal just decent. People make a too much of a fuzz over this. Lol. Still just good."}
{"text":"So I heard how this is the best Burger place ever. So I tried it. I got a hamburger an order of fries and a chocolate shake. Total was $5.85. A little expensive was my first thought. I got my food and wow there was a lot more fries than I expected. The fries were just average. The Burger was piled with a lot of fresh lettuce and tomato and onions. The Burger itself was a little smaller than I was guessing but that just means. Ill have to go double double next time. It was good and the shake was so chocolatey and a little thick. I left stuffed and pretty happy. Great service and clean store."}
{"text":"Good food and very friendly staff. My only warning is to settle in if you plan to use the drive thru. They seem to struggle to get a car through there in less than 20 minutes, sometimes more. It doesn't seem to be an issue of too many cars showing up at once, either; they just don't move the line. I think it might be faster to park, walk in, order, eat, and use the restroom.  So, you know, good, but not a good idea if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"After a night of binge drinking, nothing hits the spot like a double double, animal style. Heaven wedged between to spongy buns"}
{"text":"In and out is established as a great burger place for man reasons. They make quality food to order, with great ingredients. The menu is limited but anything your order is going to be delicious. The only downside, this place can get ultra busy, and despite the staffs best efforts, a prolonged wait is not uncommon. I guess that's a good problem for the restaurant to have, but for hungry burger seekers who happen to drive up at the wrong time, can cause a bit of a headache. Staff are not just friendly, but super friendly. Iconic for a reason."}
{"text":"I always try to make it to at least one In-N-Out whenever I come to the west coast. Out of all the burger joints I have tasted in Vegas, In-N-Out is the only one where you get a ton of food for under $10. I had the Double Double Animal Style with spread (their special sauce) on the side along with fries and a drink. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my first time at an in and out and I was mainly here to see the hoopla and it was delicious. The service was fast and the tables were clean immediately as soon as someone left. They burgers were really good and tasty but to be honest, if you gave me two different burgers I wouldn't know he difference but then again I'm not an avid burger eater. I wish there was one in Colorado but I will settle for one whenever I'm in California again"}
{"text":"In and Out Burger has never failed me.  After my less than pleasant experience at KFC 10 minutes earlier (See my previous review) I ordered 3 Double Doubles, a large Fri, one chocolate shake and one vanilla shake.  It all came out perfect and exactly as I ordered it.  This In and Out Burger has been a frequent place of mine for many years and has always been great, just as every In and Out I have gone to has been.  There must be at least dozen people working the food line whenever I come here, and they need every one of them to handle the large customer volume.   You just can't beat a great burger!!"}
{"text":"This is my daughter's favorite place to eat. The service is always awesome and the place is always very clean."}
{"text":"Really wanted to go to In-N-Out while I was visiting in Vegas. Haven't had a burger from here in several years and I remembered them to be fresh tasting and delish. When I finally got one, it was somewhat disappointing.  Now I'm not a big meat fan in that I don't need a half pound of meat in my burger. I like the interplay between the meat, lettuce, tomatoes and whatnot. Well, I can't remember if it was always this way but the patty is only 1/8 pound. Really! So the default is \"child\" size burger. You need a 2 patty default (Double Double) to get a \"regular\" size burger. The fresh cut fries were very tasty. Overall the experience wasn't as good as I remembered."}
{"text":"So true story. Went today to get lunch for myself and co-worker. The day after Xmas is busy so I wait in drive thru for 10 minutes. Get to the window to pay and realize I forgot my wallet!!  I figured that's it. All that time wasted and I'll have to come back. Well I told the cashier at the window and he promptly handed me my food and said don't worry about it!!!  How awesome is that!!  Of course I'm going  back to pay right now. But they went above and beyond and did a really cool thing today. Thanks !!"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of in-n-outs, but this one wasn't that good. It didn't taste like I remembered. I wanted to bring my hubby here for the first time but they screwed the orders up. I wanted our fries to be animal style and somehow it was rung up for the burger to be that way..... they didn't even animal style my burger! I asked the guy and he said they'd fix it for us despite the mistake... which I'm happy for.  Nothing will compare to the northern cali chains."}
{"text":"Best fast food burger. Hands down. I would sacrifice 1000 fast food restaurants for a single location of in-n-out. Definitely a west coast bias here. Get a 4x4 with the fries animal style."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and I was disgusted by this place. I don't understand what the big deal is about this place? The patty is paper thin. I shouldn't have to order 3-4 patties, it should be a real burger that's a good 1/2 inch to an inch thick and juicy inside. There was no seasoning and no flavor. Just a plain burger like I would get from Burger King. I'm happy they don't have these in Chicago. Clearly the west coast doesn't know what a real burger is supposed to be/taste like."}
{"text":"Zero complaints. Quick. Haven't had one order botched. Always tastes the same and same quality service of anywhere. A bit lengthy wait times depending on where you go but it's usually because a lot of people go there, not due to lack of trying."}
{"text":"I measure by three different things in comparison to Taco Bell:  DECOR: In-N-Out Burgers are fairly noticeable with their exterior always being white and having the roofing influenced by Spanish tile. However, I'm pretty sure Taco Bell did that whole roofing thing first... and they look way better. 0 Stars for Decor. Sorry guys.  SERVICE: Service was average. What you expected. 1 star here.    FOOD: I got the burger, \"animal style\", as they say and fries. To be honest it wasn't that good. Maybe my expectations were too high, but the burger just didn't blow my mind like I thought I would. It's decent and would be fine if you craved a burger, but really not the best burger. Not even close. Just 1 star since they do have the cool secret menu items so have to give them that.  FINAL VERDICT: Is Taco Bell better? Yes.  I highly anticipated In-N-Out. I was so excited I thought I was gong to explode from the food I was going to have. I am a long time veteran of Five Guys, so I thought alright here we go In-N-Out Burger! Yet, honestly it wasn't that stellar. I have to admit I rather have Five Guys and Taco Bell over In-N-Out any day. The burger to me just wasn't that outstanding and the fries bland. I've had Taco Bells that seemed more fresh then In-N-Out burger. Do yourself a favour and think outside the bun. Head over to Taco Bell instead!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of \"fast food,\" but I make an exception for In-N-Out every time.   The food is extremely fresh and cooked to order. The secret menu is absolutely delicious (my favorite is the animal style fries-- it's a meal on its own) and for people on diets, INO offers protein style burgers that replaces the bun with lettuce. Do a quick Google search for \"In-N-Out secret menu\" and you'll get the full rundown.   Drive-through is normally faster than getting it in the store but if you want to preserve the taste you should definitely eat it immediately after purchase. It's still amazing slightly cold, but there is a big difference when you eat it fresh off the burner.   Although the location may have something to do with it (university campus), lines are almost always present at any INO in the Vegas area. Despite that, it's plenty worth the wait.   Give In-N-Out a shot and you'll never go back to any other fast food joint for a burger again."}
{"text":"Clean Friendly Decent price Good food Fried onions. Yum yum can see why it is rated 1 amongst fast food burgers"}
{"text":"My girl friend introduced me to In n Out. I am well satisfied with the service, quality and cleanliness. Also was surprised that it was rated #1 on an internet survey. Happy girl friend,  happy me."}
{"text":"I'm originally from California and I was pleasantly surprised of the efficiency and cleanliness of the in-n-out location. We had Chris as a cashier and he was very friendly and knowledgeable. I was a little disappointed that they did offer roadkill fries which is essentially Flying Dutchman on top of Animal Style fries, but my boyfriend kindly reminded me that each store is different from another. As we waited for our food it was very busy but they were very fast!! I wanted to make a shout out to Ali who was going around and making an effort to make sure all the tables were wiped clean. I've been to over 15 in n outs in my life, I'm happy to know the one near my house is so fantastic. And of course, the food is always amazing."}
{"text":"SO EXCITED to have an In-N-Out so close to home. Friendly staff, good food, and not too long of a wait (surprisingly)! Our order was correct and tasted just as it should."}
{"text":"Soo yummy! The double double burgers never disappoint. Great milkshakes. Josh is an amazing employee and provided excellent customer service. All the staff was friendly and sociable. Had a great experience."}
{"text":"Being an East Coaster I don't usually get In-N-Out except when I travel to California to visit family. Was very happy to find out there was one in the Tempe/Phoenix area when I was flying in for an event. And cracked a smile on the way to the hotel when I saw the neon sign from my Uber. It wasn't the most convenient drive from where I was staying. And my roommate - who had the car rental - wasn't stoked about having to drive us. And she definitely wasn't impressed with the drive-thru line. But once she tried it, she understood.   Went with my standard Double Double Animal Protein style. Hit the mark as expected. The fries didn't make it too long in the car - they were gone before we got back to the hotel. Thank goodness we didn't get animal fries; now that would have been interesting!  I can understand why some think we might be crazy for getting excited about fast food. But it's sort of like that scarcity principle - because I can't have it once a day, more like only once a year - I tend to get a little silly when it comes to getting my In-N-Out fix."}
{"text":"Always a fan of In-N-Out. And being steps from my hotel (the LINQ) lobby, isn't such a bad place to be either. Like all locations, this place is cranking out the food! And being one of the more affordable options on the strip, it's definitely busy at all times of day.   Seeing I didn't know when we would be making a trip to California again, it was a must to check out the new Promenade location and get my fix while I was in town. First visit I went for my standard Double Double Animal Protein burger and Animal Fries (well done!). Instead of braving the crowd, I took it back up to my room to enjoy in peace. Second visit, I just got a simple double double animal style (no fries); the lettuce wrapping takes a little longer at this location then I've experienced at other ones so I went without this time.   In-N-Out definitely ranks up there as a must stop whenever I'm in range for a visit."}
{"text":"I don't know that it's fair for me, as a vegan, to write a review for a burger joint. All I can eat is their fries with grilled onions, but they are always fresh! They're also the only place (that I know of) where I can get a drive-thru 7-Up soda. I only drink soda when I have a sick tummy, so it's nice and convenient to be able to swing by here when I need one.   My family isn't vegan. They love the burgers and animal fries (which are on the \"secret\" menu).    Open late. The drive-thru line gets long, but it goes pretty fast. The workers are always nice, friendly, & smiling. I love how they repeat your order a second time, for accuracy, once you get to the window.   If they ever decide to offer a vegan veggie burger, I would be SO elated!"}
{"text":"Growing up in Oregon, I'd never heard of  In & Out, saw the Urge stickers & thought it was some kind of sex activity.  Cheeze booga, cheeze booga, Coke, no Pepsi, fries, no chep chep..."}
{"text":"The best fast food anywhere.  Oh wait, ok, tied with chik filet.  Location is good, but I get inconsistent fries.  Sometimes delicious and nice and crispy, other times, bland, mushy garbage.  Ugh, fix this please so I can give you the 5 stars you deserve for the best burgers anywhere!!  Oh, and I love the lettuce wrap double double. (shhhh, it's the \"secret\" menu item.. . :)."}
{"text":"I know IN-N-OUT is all the rage, but it's truly one of my least desirable destinations.  Why?  I'm not sure other than their food is uninspiring to me.  Is it fresh?  Yes.  Is that unusual for burger joints?  Yes.  Still... I'd just as soon get a burger anywhere than wait in line here for a generic burger.  Give me something smothered with BBQ sauce or bacon or pepper jack cheese.  Knowhatimean?"}
{"text":"Good as usual. We didn't think it would be as crowded as the one we went to in California since there's so many in the Las Vegas area....wrong lol. Can't blame the place for making a good burger! (:"}
{"text":"For fast food, it doesnt get much better. This buger beats Mcdonalds, Burger King, Wendys, Carls Jr, Sonic, Jack in the Box. Does it beat a good sit down restaurant burger? Prolly not, but its king of the fast food jungle. Ask for animal style you wild beast, its the way to go!"}
{"text":"This is the closest in-and-out to my apartment, so I go here every few weeks or so.  For some reason I liked the burgers they serve at the Sunset location better, but this one is mostly fine."}
{"text":"Yes - another predictable review for In and Out.  Lately I've found myself in this area a lot for work - and normally I've been eating like a rabbit and foraging raw veggies, fruits and nuts during the day and then getting the bulk of my calories for dinner on weekdays.  But sometimes I go nutso and need something heavier to get me through the day.  For counting calories - this is one of my favorite meals to get on the fly.  A lettuce wrap cheeseburger (double double has too many calories) with all the veggies on it, and ketchup and mustard is about less than 300 calories.  And satisfies my cravings for heavier food.  Together with a huge unsweetened ice tea makes a really nice meal.  I could go somewhere else for the same amount of calories but - this burger actually tastes good and satisfying as if I had a really good fatty treat.  Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers made just the way you like. Very simple menu. I always order animal style fries and an animal style cheeseburger with extra toasted bun!! Ask for more spread. Service is always ok point and the workers are friendly."}
{"text":"Came as a sad Canadian tourist determined to discover the carnal pleasures of the In-N-Out, and left A MAN. Had been tipped before hand on 'Animal Style' EVERYTHING, ordered the double cheeseburger and animal fries, and despite the place being PACKED had our food in about 3 minutes.  The food was godly, the staff was super efficient, the restaurant was surprisingly clean considering the amount of traffic they obviously saw. The fact that we don't have these in Canada is proof that Jesus hates Canadians.  If you're in Vegas, make sure you hit it up. It's right off the strip and was only about a $10 cab ride from our hotel (Luxor)."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here! They make awesome burgers and have awesome customer service!   I came in with my family and there was an e employee there by the name of Jettson or Jefferson (sorry I forgot which... But along those lines) he was super animated and walking around to make sure everyone was happy and well taken care of. He seriously made my experience there the best I've had anywhere. EVER. He even did this super adorably cheesey magic trick that my little sister loved!   The burger and animal style fries are a completely different thing. The burger is aamazing and juicy and just heaven on two buns with cheese, onions, & pickles. And the fries are to die for.   So, yeah go check them out :) I think I'll be heading back there very soon!"}
{"text":"Love In-N-Out. Always have to stop at least once when in Las Vegas or California. The location by the High Roller between the Flamingo and Linq is always busy, but super efficient. Animal style is the only way to go and well done in the fries."}
{"text":"I go there the place is always packed but they are really fast at getting the food out. I give them credit most of the help are teenagers  but there always working and clean. The foods alright  Ive tasted better hamburgers but I can't say anything bad about a place that is always packed."}
{"text":"\"in-n-out ... in-n-out ... that's what a hamburger's all about !\"  The menu is simple : burgers, fries, shakes ... however you want to order it simple or complicated, they'll take care of you.     If I want to be complicated foodie I will order a double single burger extra toasted with extra lettuce and grilled onions cut in half with well done fries with extra spread on the side and strawberry shake (don't judge me) otherwise if I'm being basic ... number 2 with a pink lemonade.  We had tickets to a show at the LINQ so we wanted to grab a quick bite to eat and of course I chose in-n-out.  This location is a bit more expensive then your local in-n-out, but it's expected to be that way because it's the strip.  Also don't be too intimidated by the large crowds, the line moves quite quickly.     I find it from people that either you love in-n-out or you hate it.   I am hands down always a fan."}
{"text":"I hate it when the person working the register doesn't listen.  Me: I want a #2 grilled onions mustard instead of spread. I want a cheeseburger no salt nothing on it but extra extra extra extra pickles. I want 1 additional med drink. Josh: ok, I have 3 cheeseburgers ... Me: no, 2 cheeseburgers Josh: right. 2 cheeseburgers. One grilled onions mustard instead of sauce. One burger no salt extra extra extra extra pickles 2 fries Me: no, 1 fries Josh: right. So the 2 cheeseburger, one fries & 2 med drinks. Me: yes  So we waited for a long time because we were 14 numbers away from being called. When we got our food we got; A cheeseburger with no pickles. I guess when you don't want spread (1000 island dressing) that secretly means you don't want pickles.  A cheeseburger that was ordered with XXXX pickles but showed up with 7. Evidently the person who assembled our burgers thinks 3 pickles is normal and each extra means 1 more. Other than that, the temperature in the dining room was very cold. We always ask for an additional tray to cover our fries so they stayed pretty warm while we ate. Freezing dining room. Pickles missing on 1 cheeseburger. Skimpy pickles on 1 cheeseburger. A cashier that \"thinks\" for the customer. 2 Stars."}
{"text":"After our 2 recent 'not so great' experiences @ the Fiesta Mall location, C said he wanted In N Out so we came here. We've had good experiences in the past BUT not today. Our cashier, Thalia, just didn't listen. I ordered a med drink ($1.55) with a Cheeseburger ($2.50) then a #2 (Cheeseburger, Fries, Med drink $5.75)but she assumed I only wanted the drink that came with the #2, which was wrong, so she only rang up one drink. Plus, AS ALWAYS, I ordered C's Cheeseburger with extra, extra, extra, extra Pickles. Thalia only rang in extra twice. Today that equalled 8 pickles. Regardless, C said his burger was fine. The bun was grilled nicely & the cheese was just melting. Winner winner Cheeseburger dinner. My Cheeseburger was protein style w/ no onions & mustard instead of spread. Why does \"no spread\" translate to 'No Pickles?' Just because I don't want 1000 Island dressing DOESN'T mean I don't like Pickles. In fact, just as a general rule, STOP making decisions for me. I've been eating at In N Out for 39 years. I think I know what I want. Listen to my order. Place the order the way I order it. We'll all be happy & 5 Stars would be a sure thing.  Cashier didn't listen. Dirty dining room. Great Cheeseburgers. Wish there were Pickles. 3 Stars."}
{"text":"5 Stars. I know, that's basically saying there was no room for improvement. How can that be? There's always room for improvement. But not this time. C & I walked in & were pleasantly greeted by Brandon. I ordered our usual In n Out fare; 2 Cheeseburgers, 1 Fries & 2 drinks. C ALWAYS gets the same Cheeseburger. Nothing on it except extra extra extra extra pickles. That's right, 4 extras. Brandon asked C if he really likes pickles & of course the answer was \"yes\". So Brandon said he would add a side of pickles. Oh yaaa! I got my Cheeseburger with grilled onions and mustard instead of spread. When I picked up the burgers C could not believe how much Brandon had hooked him up. First, there was a side of pickles, 19 pickles in a burger wrapper. Then there was his Cheeseburger. 17 pickles. Winner winner dill pickle dinner. So far, in C's 9 years and many many fast food cheeseburgers, the most pickles C ever got was 36. That was from Chris at the In n Out by Chandler Fashion Center. So this was EPIC! Both our burgers were great. The fries were yummy. The dining room was clean & being cleaned while we ate by an employee wiping down the tables and sweeping the floor. Nice. The condiment bar was also clean as was the drink station. Great customer service, great Cheeseburgers, clean environment, fair prices. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"This is our favorite location. I've been eating at In N Out's for ever growing up in So. Cal. I would give this location a 5 star BUT they run their air conditioning TOO cold. No reason to have it set in the 70's when it's over 100 outside. That being said, this location has the BEST staff. Always friendly. Drive-thru and dining room. My son always orders his cheeseburger with xtra xtra xtra xtra pickles. One time we were here they gave him a white burger wrapper filled with pickles. Xtra pickles means xtra pickles the guy said. Nice! Every time we've been here the food has been as ordered. I can't remember ever having an issue with the food. The dining room is kept clean and wiped down."}
{"text":"I love in n out! This location is always busy but they're usually pretty fast. They always get my order correct and are friendly."}
{"text":"It's ok there are better burger places but for price of the fast food it's ok. Like the shakes though. Place was messy and noisy."}
{"text":"Man, I had a HUGE craving for a burger today.  I started weight watchers a few months ago and am pretty limited on the types of burgers that I can eat now.  I was SO surprised when I found that In-n-out has a six points hamburger lettuce tomato onion and ketchup only.  This totally satisfied my craving.  I have been a fan of in-n-out for years and diet wise the food isn't really that bad for you compared to other fast food places.  Btw, for all the ww yelpers, the fries are 9 points.  I stayed away from those this time....but there's always next visit.  My baby LOVES their cheeseburgers, so great for kids too! (especially picky children) and my husband loves their animal style burgers and fries, but I'm not a huge fan of that."}
{"text":"This is the 1st stop after we get out of the airport. Love those great cheeseburgers and fries. My sister says the shakes are great . This establishment is always clean, friendly employees. Their patrons are friendly since we have always been able to strike up a conversation with fellow dining patrons. Maybe it's just the thrill of being in Vegas, but these are great burgers!"}
{"text":"Only because this location gets super packed. The food is good sometimes but they know they aren't serving west coasters so they slob on the thousand island. I don't like that but people don't worry about extra \"dressing\" so it works.   This location is like no other I've been to."}
{"text":"I love you In-N-Out! This is my one stop burger stop. The food is tasty, the price is cheap and the fries are fresh. They even hand cut their fries all day long.   In-N-Out is an old fashion burger joint that specialized in just that...burgers, fries and milkshakes.  Huge, major, super important factoid - In-N-Out is one of the only places left that still makes homemade milkshakes. YUMMY!  The burgers are awesome and makes sure to ask them for it \"Animal style\" They fry the mustard into the burger and grill onions as well. Then they top it off extra secret sauce. YUM. Also, if you are feel anti-carb that day ask for it protein style. They wrap the burger with lettuce instead of a bun. Its really tasty.  This is my favorite take out burger....simple, tasty and cheap. If it wasn't for all the calories and fat I would eat here every day. In-N-Out ends up being like a Sin-N-Pout when eaten too often...I still love you Sin-N-Pout :)"}
{"text":"The best burgers and fries on earth have eaten there since early days of surfing yes 59 60 til now Wow is this good stuff"}
{"text":"Hello in and out! I never knew what an animal style was until my husband introduced me to it. Now my go to hamburger is a single cheeseburger protein style and animal style. Wow! This totally changes everything about hamburgers. I have yet to try the shakes but will do it eventually! Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not as good as good as Whataburger, P Terry's, Mighty Fine, Dans or Fran's.  I used to think these guys were the top of the fast burger chain 10 years ago.  Maybe they should have just stuck to california as they definitely lost something over the years."}
{"text":"I don't eat burgers often, but when I do...it has to be in-n-out!  I'm not much of a fast food person, but being from SoCal, in-n-out is my preferred place for burgers.  The burgers here are just as tasty as the ones from SoCal.  If you haven't had a chance to try, then definitely go for it.  I've always heard that animal style burger and fries are the best, but can't comment on it since I don't like onions.  But I do get my fries well done, and it's delish!  The staff here is just as friendly as any other in-n-out locations."}
{"text":"Pretty good for fast food burgers. Nothing else really to say. I get the cheese burger with fries and it's just that. Good quality fast food but not amazing. I don't think any fast food burger can be amazing though. Their fries are average."}
{"text":"A must while in Vegas! Great taste and affordable, the cashier Michelle is very sweet and calm, which is needed in such a busy restaurant! Highly recommend getting there right when it opens, 10:30am, or not during meal time. It is extremely busy!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner and was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed a \"fast food\" dinner. Firstly, I noticed how clean the restaurant was and how friendly the staff treated us. We ordered protein burgers with cheese, tomatoes and onion; served on iceberg lettuce instead of a bun. French fries were very fresh and not greasy. A nice quick stop for dinner."}
{"text":"Just reviewing this location.  It meets the superior standard of what I expect from In-N-Out.  Helpful efficient staff for both orders and keeping the place clean.  Handles a very large crowd efficiently and is a pleasant place to sit down and get out of the crazy intensity of the strip.  For Vegas, prices are very reasonable.  They have a nice gift shop window that you do not find in most other locations as well."}
{"text":"I love In & Out and this one is the closest to the strip but not walkable sadly. So we called a cab to take us to the drive thru."}
{"text":"Great burgers! The food is always fresh and delicious! The prices are cheap. It is the only place to get high quality burgers, fries, and milkshakes for a good price."}
{"text":"I love love this place! Its close to my house and they stay open until late. The people that work here (mostly young) are super fast! If there are long lines I never wait more then a min or two to get my order in. The food is delicious and the place is super clean. They are always restocking things and cleaning tables as soon as clients leave. Also, everyone here is super polite! I totally recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Having lived in California for the past 15 years, I am amazed at how packed each In n Out contiunes to be.  It can only be because they serve one product, they serve it well, and for the most part, they serve it with a smile.  I have never had anyone at In N Out give me the wrong order.  I have never had anyone look like they didn't want to be there, and I have never had a bad burger.  For a fast food burger, these are the cream of the crop.  Real meat, onions raw or grilled, melted cheese, awesome fries (until they get cold) and a secret menu that will please nearly everone.  You can even get grilled cheese, animal style, protein style, animal fries, 2X2, 3X3, 4X4 or X x X.  Order a neopolitan shake to wash it down.  They will give you a placemat for your car and they usually have cool merchandise.  There are no kids meals here.  The buns could be better, and if the fries get cold, they lose their appeal.  If you haven't had In n Out, give it a try!"}
{"text":"What can I say about In-N-Out that hasn't already been said.  It is my favorite fast food burger.  The staff is almost always friendly, the restaurant almost always busy and the store has some really cute stuff.  When in doubt, choose In-N-Out.  Don't forget the secret (not so secret) menu for protein style (lettuce instead of bun) or animal style (slathered with a chili type sauce) or multiple patties and cheese 2x2, 3x3, 4x4.  The fries are fresh cut and taste great while they are warm so eat them quickly.  Ando you can get your shake vanilla, chocolate or strawberry or ask for neopolitan (a littl e of each.)   Enjoy,we do."}
{"text":"The burgers and customer service were both great.  It's rare these days that you get good customer service.  The group of youngsters working here all had smiles on their faces.  They were more than  happy to get us in and out with a tasty burger in hand.   What amazed me was the fact that I ordered my burger with cheese only.  At most burger joints this would have been like me throwing a huge wrench in their burger making machine.  At In-N-Out Burger even though they were busy they got my burger order right.   The burgers, fries and drinks were good."}
{"text":"Love this place! First timer. Didn't go animal style because I wasn't even aware of it until after we left and I got a ton of messages about it.  We need this place on the west coast. I'm a huge Whataburger fan, and I have to admit, this places gives W a run for its money. But it's a slightly different style.   We grabbed their fries, a few double-doubles, and a couple of shakes (chocolate and vanilla). We could only slightly tell the difference between the chocolate and vanilla. Not sure if that's a bad thing, but if I have a craving for a chocolate shake, I'll likely go elsewhere.  The DD was great! Juicy without being over-greasy. Just enough for lunch without feeling guilty. They know what they're doing. The bun was soft but had a slight crisp that worked very well with the lettuce and tomatoes. We option for onion which I normally love but I'm not sure it added anything. The thousand island adds enough without the need of onion. (More experimentation needed).  Can't wait to go back... You know... When I'm in Vegas... Whenever that may be."}
{"text":"Lived up to expectations - always heard about this place and thought yeah, yeah how good could it be. Well it was that good. Had the double-double burger with fries and a shake.  All were great.  The fries tasted like freshly made, hand cut - and not too greasy (like some other popular places)."}
{"text":"I ate at what felt like 100 fancy pants places while staying in Vegas for 6 days. Somehow, we ended up at In and Out every night!   We even headed straight here after leaving a Sushi Bar. After a night of boozing, we had the driver take us here to soak up all the alcohol the Venetian gave us.    In and Out is exactly what the name says. They've got fast service, great food, and the staff is all smiles. You'll be in and out in no time!   I always get a Double Double Animal Style. (This is part of the not-so \"secret\" menu.) If I'm really drunk, I'll get my fries this way too along with a \"grilled cheese\". I love the sauce. It's just amazing!  GO! What are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Who seriously doesn't love In-N-Out burgers? It's simply delicious!! I would like a #3 with grilled onions and a Dr.pepper right now!!"}
{"text":"Definitely an excellent place to go to eat a good burger although the chips were a bit burned"}
{"text":"I don't know how this keeps happening but I have always lived within a 5-mile radius to In N Out. From our home in Riverside, to Garden Grove, to Orange, to my undergrad college in Irvine and now grad school in Arizona! Coincidence? Or fate? lol.  Well I guess thats the reason why I'm not super fanatic about their burgers like some people are, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't crave it once in a while. This location has friendly workers ( I think they all do) and I opt for their animal style fries or their protein burger. Sometimes I'll get a cheeseburger with their fried mustard and pickles. Yup, you read that right, it does exist. I don't know what else is on their \"secret\" menu but I'm sure if you ask they will tell. I have to limit myself to one burger every 3-4 months though, I get so bloated after eating there lol."}
{"text":"I know, I know. All In-N-Outs are supposed to have the same quality food. But I have to disagree after dining here last time I was in Vegas. I'm not sure if I was just hungry or if it had been too long since I had In-N-Out but the quality of the food was amazing at this location! I ate my usual cheeseburger with no onions with a side of well-done fries. The burger was on point: the bun was toasted perfectly, meat was juicy and seasoned well, vegetables were fresh and crisp, the perfect dressing-to-burger ratio. OMG. Even the fries were perfect. Not too crispy, not too limp. Next time I'm in Vegas, you can be sure I'm going out of my way to eat at this In-N-Out location. Sure, the wait time for food is noticeably longer, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Their animal fries is to die for! Yum! Also love that protein style burgers is an option"}
{"text":"\"I don't eat fast food.\" Pfft!  Nope, that's a lie. In-N-Out is fast and I'm sticking to it.  In-N-Out doesn't feel like a bad thing to do. (And it *was* super fast!) Had this heavenly goodness for the first time recently. I almost keeled over in delight while sampling the fries. GOODNESS GRACIOUS.   Why has no one told me about this place before?  All french fries should taste like this! I'll never have a fry again elsewhere. Why bother? These are the best kind. Light, crispy but not too crunchy. It didn't feel like grease was involved in frying them. But the pure vegetable oil I later learned that is used. Delightful.  I still can't believe it.   I was cheated growing up eating the mushy drive thru fries of other chains as a child. (Thanks Mom!) I'll save this special treat for special indulgences. Totally worth it. Loved it!  OTHER STUFF + The quality of sound during drive thru order process was crisp/clear. + Staff was super polite, easy to understand.  + Staff was helpful. Cheery! (NYE 11:15pm)"}
{"text":"Great as always.  My kids love the shakes and burgers.  Anytime my kids are happy with their food, is a win in my book."}
{"text":"Best value for hamburger and fries. Friendly staff. Flavorful food served hot and fresh. I'm an In-and-Out believer!"}
{"text":"How does In N Out do it?  The consistency is amazing.  The service is impeccable.  Do these happy boppy teens really love their jobs?  Does upper management   inject them with happiness cola on their breaks?  I don't get it.  But this is what I like best about In N Out, the service!  The delish burger sure makes it a great trip too.  Going to In N Out is a \"trip\", it's always busy, so it's not like a quickie run for a burger and fry.    The Fries-- not sure that I like them, I always order them simply b/c everything is so cheap- but I also always eat them.  I think I just like watching the happy staff cut them up."}
{"text":"It's In-N-Out Burger...  Double double with spread, pickles and onions only.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh and fun!!! Burger was tastey, and the blueberry pie shake was top 4 all time shakes!!!"}
{"text":"My first time having In-N-Out. SOOO CHEAP, SOOO WORTH.   Very good burger, but I am an East Coast burger chain girl at the end of the day. The patty is just better at Shake Shack/5 Guys!  This location is pretty busy. I ordered one burger and probably waited 10-15 minutes. During the day, there are so many pigeons outside???!!! They aren't afraid of people, AND THEY FLY CLOSE TO YOUR HEAD. But they disappear during night??"}
{"text":"Maybe people just always want what they don't have. If they had In-N-Out on every street corner in Dallas like McD's or Starbucks, would they still taste so DAMN good to me? I dunno, and I don't think I want to find out.  It's like the first time I had a chicken Big Fat Taco from Del Taco - HOLY SHIRTS AND PANTS I thought it was SOOO good! Screw Taco Bell! Screw Taco Bueno! Granted I was hung over, so that might have factored in somehow as well.  So I went on a Saturday afternoon and like previous people have mentioned, the place was jam packed with a line out the door. The line moved quickly, however there wasn't enough seating so we had to hover over people who looked like they were almost done with their food and our group of 8 had to split up. I almost started getting annoyed and questioned why we wasted a cab ride here until our food arrived. *angels chorus from up above* I don't know what it is about these damn burgers that make them so tasty. I think they sprinkle crack or MSG in the patties. Fixin's were all fresh. Fries were ordered animal style. Delicious, crisp, fresh fries (they don't even have time to get cold, do you see this line out the door?) It was the best meal I ate in Vegas."}
{"text":"my usual #2 Animal style was perfect... however the drug dealers and prostitutes outside were the main attraction.. never underestimate the arts and entertainment of a burger at the local vegas in n out..."}
{"text":"There is no better fast food burger made.    Tasty burger made with fresh ingredients.   Real French fries made hot and fresh.    In and Out is awesome!"}
{"text":"So busier than most In and Out Burger locations.  Unfortunately, the night we went the high schoolers showed up and were well......high school kids.   The best thing about In and Out is consistency of food.  The burgers always are fresh and well prepared.  When it comes to the fries, you either love them or you hate them.   I like them so I am going to call them tasty."}
{"text":"I love in-n-out but this is one of their busier stores that I have been to! The food was good but service wasn't exactly \"in-n-out\"."}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out. I am so happy to have one close by once again. The food is always good and the workers are always pleasant to deal with. I have never run into a rude employee. This location lives up to those high standards. Even when it is busy, which is most of the time, they get you through the line quickly. The food is fresh and delicious. I will always choose In-N-Out over other fast food places because the quality is much better for the same price or even less."}
{"text":"After living out west for ages, I moved to San Antonio.  Home to ZERO In-N-Out Burgers!  It was a long few years, but now I am here in Phoenix, and I have been reunited with my old flame.    We picked up just where we left off.  You would never know we hadn't seen or heard from one another in four years.  I took hold of the hot, fresh, juiciness and went to town.  After a few short minutes, it was over.  I wiped the remaining secret sauce from my face.  All I could think about was when we would do it again.....  It will be soon, I assure you it will.  Here are a few of the reasons why In-N-Out gets a solid for stars from me. -There are no microwaves, heat lamps or freezers -They use additive, preservative and filler free beef -The fries are fresh cut all day long -The shakes are made from real ice cream -This is a private, family owned company, with no plans to go public or franchise -The employees smile and make you feel like your business is appreciated.    It is always packed, so be prepared to wait a few minutes.  If you like crispy fries, be sure to order them well done.  If you don't eat meat, order a grilled cheese (prepared on meat-free cooking surface).  Learn the secret In-N-Out lingo, or just order your burger animal style..."}
{"text":"For fast food in the West, In&Out has my vote. I especially dig the toasted buns and the \"something special\" they have going on with their burgers. I do not like the fries, but then again, I haven't found any fries in the western US that satisfy me.   Your choices are very basic: How many burgers? How many fries? What to drink? Some might scoff at the simplicity, but as a minimalist I enjoy the shit out of it.  This particular location is like two stories. Pretty sweet."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and always fast and friendly service.  One of my favorites!  The shakes are one of the best around.  Fries dont do much for me but smother them in salt and ketchup and pretty darn good.  It's nice to see a burger place with employees that take pride in their work."}
{"text":"\"...Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines...\" but this cheese-burger, \"thy eternal summer shall not fade..\"  I'll quit ripping off the Bard after I'm done with these fresh cut fries! (Of course, these fries, they art more lovely and more temperate than a summer's day.)   Solid in-n-out location here but today they messed up our order (shorted us one burger with cheese.) The drive thru gets backed up like at many locations so double double check your order.   You animal!   My apologies to Shakespeare. And right! Don't forget the chocolate shakes!"}
{"text":"Can I please tell you how much of an In-N-Out fan I am? I don't care that I'm from the East Coast, Shake Shack doesn't compete. #Realtalk   This location is cheaper. Noticeably.   Had the double stack with a milkshake. Let me tell you how I devoured every bite and then licked my fingers. My friend taught me well, and we ordered our burgers with fried onions which really helped combine all the flavors together. Everything about the in-n-out burger is perfect. The patty isn't just a slammed down piece of meat that tastes like rubber. It actually tastes like meat.   Best of all the line is shorter here than the one near the strip."}
{"text":"I've  always enjoyed this location, since it's so close to UNLV campus. I'm the type to order \"monkey style\" or a 4×4 \"animal style\" burger and well done fries. I like to do secret recipe type orders. I left a star out due to the entrance. It's a hassle trying to turn in off Maryland Pkwy. You must make a u-turn. Other than that it's always a pretty packed location. However they NEVER get an order wrong... at least not mine. That's the type of service you get when going to In-N-Out. Will return to this location as I've been doing for years."}
{"text":"Always great service and delicious food. Truly great American fast burger. Drive thru lines are always busy, beware."}
{"text":"My Favorite place to have a burger!    The best fries too.  Try ordering a chicken sandwich!    Plus... Have every thing animalized!"}
{"text":"This is the least busy In-n-Out in all of Las Vegas. Case in point:  when I moved to this neighborhood a year ago, Mel C. and I came here around 8pm on a Saturday night and NO ONE else was in the restaurant.  At an In-n-Out Burger.  It's true.   Even now, when we drive by, we always look at the drive-thru and the most I've ever seen are four cars in line.  This is just one benefit of living in North Las Vegas:  you can truly be in and out at this location."}
{"text":"The In-N-Out at the Linq Promenade is one busy business, but they are smooth operators there.  Our favorite place to get burgers, In-N-Out serves up their regular items with a slight upcharge, but not by much.  It's crowded, yes, and you may not be able to find a seat at prime hours (like on New Year's Day), but there is plenty of seating next to the fountain outside. My regular order is the #3:  hamburger with grilled onions, fries well-done, and a root beer.  It's just as good here as it is at other locations so if you want your fix, just be a little patient for your order and you'll be enjoying the best of the West in no time."}
{"text":"worth the waiting in line for the delish fresh burgers & fries. animal sytle fries & protein sytle burger with extra grill onions are what i usually ordered"}
{"text":"Being from WA, I would always have friends who travel to this area often recommend this place. You can't beat cheap, good eats, right!?  So of course, my last visit to Vegas we came here. Needless to say, the burger was pretty good! Personally, I wasn't the biggest fan of the fries (my preference is still Dick's fries up in Seattle!) but I would certainly come here again when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it's convenient, good tasting, and cheap compared to other fast food establishments in the area.   Fries are sliced right there, using whole potatoes!  Burgers are cooked to order.  I love the SPREAD and always ask for extra packets for my dipping sauce for the fries. It's a taste of mayo, ketchup, and relish - YUM!  Waiting is my biggest complaint, but what can you do?  The best thing is if you haven't been or don't know - check out there SECRET menu online! Too die for!"}
{"text":"The line moves FAST!!  Don't be scared. The line was at the back door at our arrival & we were ordering in about five minutes & hand double doubles in hand after five more.  Secret menu (available online) was a huge help to us as new comers. Get everything \"animal style\" and thank me later."}
{"text":"Went here because someone needed to get their In-N-Out fix when visiting from the East Coast. Personally, I don't get it -- yes, the burgers are good, the fries are marginal. I think the secret to enjoyment might be doing some research before going next time. For example -- I just looked up \"Animal Style Fries\" and though I knew there was a secret menu I did not realize that things could be so much better -- like next time Protein Style is something I need to remember: \"your favorite burger wrapped in hand-leafed lettuce instead of a bun\" That, alone could be a reason to get me wanting to return..."}
{"text":"CHEESE AND RICE!!!!  If you only make 3 muhfuggin things, you'd better make those 3 muhfuggin things gosh darned well, by golly!  The burger was only a buck-69, sure, but it was dinky, and it wasn't going to matter *how* I used it; there just wasn't enough meat. [insert joke about how \"I'm not used to that\" here...bahdumbump]  GOT DOWN SAT ON A BENCH!!!!!  I sat as the first car in the drive through, after having paid and gotten my drink, for literally 8 minutes, knowing full well that I'd only ordered a single burger and fries, wondering what the creative curses the poor folks behind me were hurling at me for thinking that I'd ordered the whole store. Sure, it was 12:30-ish, but I watched about ten orders go out the front counter in this time.  Again, no exaggeration.   If the orders were in fact being passed out in turn, and the inside counter had gotten that backed up, that's a pretty sad thing. Finally the food...  fuh-DANG-ah!!!!!!!       Dem buns was greeeezy!!!  I first noticed that the inner wrapping paper had acheived that completely see-through window effect that Dr Nick recommended Homer look for as his ticket to gaining enough weight to achieve Disability status.    I unfolded the drippy paper to find that I could literally squeeze drips of grease out of the bun like a saturated sponge, but only on one half, mind you!  The other half of the bun had edges that were hard enough to warrant 'bird-food status' for any bread product in my household.  The one napkin I'd been given was useless, since it had been purposely draped over the french fries, presumably to keep them warm(?)  Luckily, I had a stash in the car....of NAPKINS, silly.    `,8^}     I will say, since I found that slimy thing and the cool limp fries that went with it inedible, that the girl inside was quick to offer my refund, but also quick to make it clear that she wasn't really listening to any of the comments I was providing, but instead was chosing to blow me off as Mr Angry Customer.    I guess I had already shown my cards by letting slip a comment similar to:  \"If you only make 3 muhfuggin things, you'd better make those 3 muhfuggin things gosh darned well, by golly!\"  (but not verbatim~ahem~)"}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and had to introduce In & Out to the kids.  Big hit!  Great place for the occasional, but always pleasing, burger and fries.  Only gripe is the small size of the burger patty - adults should probably opt for double patty.    We love the simple menu, fresh cut fries, and service.  Plenty of staff on hand.  Clean store.   Build some in Atlanta!"}
{"text":"So many people rave about In-N-Out Burgers. I think they are just ok for a burger generally (matched against burger sit-down places, e.g., Islands) but are definitely good for a fast-food burger.  They use 100% pure beef burgers, hand-leafed (as opposed to shredded) lettuce, and sponge dough for the buns. You can taste the quality.   I like their lettuce wrapped burger (wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun). They call it  \"protein style.\"  Their french fries are actual slices of potatoes. I personally prefer the processed style fries at other restaurants (they mash the potatoes, reform them into sticks, bread them, and fry them). However, there is something homey and oddly nostalgic about natural fries cut from actual potato slices.  I will say that there is an unusually long wait (10-20 minutes?) for your food over other fast food establishment (5 minutes?), probably because items are made-to-order."}
{"text":"Before arriving to Las Vegas, we had looked up things you must do while in Vegas.  One of the things listed that you must check out was In-N-Out Burgers.  We pulled up to a packed parking lot as people were fighting for parking spots.  When we walked in the line was so long we thought, damn this is gonna be and in-n-stay rather than in-n-out burger place.  Wrong.  They were so fast along with the diners because tables were like parking spots, loads of people and cars and not a lot of seating or parking spots.  We spotted a table and downed our burgers and fries.  It reminded me of a Johnny Rockets Restaurant if you have ever been there but it was much better!!  For under $5 bucks a person, you could have a tasty burger with fries and a drink and its really good.  They apparently butcher their own meat so I was told.  At least the company which is family owned butchers their own meat.  If you are in Las Vegas and needing a quick bite, definitely stop by In-N-Out Burgers!!  It was totally worth it!!  Cheers and Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"In n Out is committed to serving fresh tasty hamburgers and fries.  I had a chocolate shake too.  Everything tastes great and the service was very professional."}
{"text":"in n out is always a good idea!!!!! Animal style forever.  We walked from our hotel (Mandalay Bay) took us about 15 minutes. So so so worth it.  Warning it's always packed! So plan accordingly. Even with how busy it was though it took maybe 7 minutes to get our food.  They were also nice enough to give us hats"}
{"text":"Pretty standard In and Out Burger.  Only thing different is the location.  It can be a bit tricky to get to depending on where you're coming from.  Just aim for the Costco and you should be able to figure it out."}
{"text":"I do think that In-N-Out Burger is over-rated.  It is not the best burger every or anything like that.  But it is a good burger.  The service here is excellent always.  It sometimes takes a while to get your food- makes you wonder why they call it 'fast food' but they will get it right.  The menu is very limited- basically burgers and fries.  No vegetarian food.  The food is much better than McDonald's but nothing as cool as Smashburger or anything."}
{"text":"Pretty standared In and Out, except the parking lot is kind of screwed up and it can be confusing to get in here depending on which way you're coming from."}
{"text":"Standard In-N-Out Burger.  They have a bit of a monopoly since I think they are the only fast food open late in the area."}
{"text":"Pretty standard In-N-Out Burger, except this one has a strange entrance and parking situation.  Once you figure that out, it's not too bad.  Also, it gets pretty busy here so expect a wait."}
{"text":"Best service, friendly employees and great food! I would definitely recommend this location!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this famous eatery that hasn't been said already? It is great.  I got a regular cheeseburger and animal fries which are smothered in onions and cheese sauce.  My husband the animal burger was looked really good.  The lines are insanely long but there's really quick turnover.  Also, the shakes are killer.  Everything is still, surprisingly, reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"In N Out is really only good when you are intoxicated..... now, that's just my opinion, I know other people go nuts for their food hence why they always have a very long line. I do appreciate that In N Out makes their food from fresh ingredients and pays their employees well. The food is just ok.... you know, except when you've been drinking."}
{"text":"I went to this location of In n Out last night aaaaat about 1:30 am. Yes, I had had some beverages. That alone should have made this experience extra delicious....but it wasn't. There was a long line, understandable. When we got our food (I got a cheeseburger animal style, BF got a double double) it wasn't up to my expectations for In n Out. The bun didn't have that little bit of crispness that I've experienced at other locations, the tomato was mealy, and they skimped on the onions. Next time I have had some beverages and am craving In n out (which is a seldom occurrence) I might keep driving to the Mesa location, which I have had better experiences at."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice; both times I waited for my food for over 30 minutes. Their number system has no order to it. They will give out food to people who order after you did. Not worth the wait for a simple burger with a thin patty."}
{"text":"This particular In-N-Out that I went to had a college campus vibe. I think my assumptions were correct as it was near UNLV. I'm not sure if this is even possible but the food had a college campus vibe to it. I feel like I have been to better In-N-Out establishments in California where it taste better or more fresh. At the bottom of my fry basket a couple of my fries were black or moldy.  I had taken a friend here to try it and we were both disappointed with the experience. I live on the east coast, so it'll take some time for me to change my mind."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, the people are extremely friendly and nice, the food is tasty and fresh like any other in n out and even though it's always packed you'll never wait for more then a few minutes to order and eat. Good job guys for loving your customers"}
{"text":"I love in-n-out. I have it for lunch once a week but could eat it everyday. This location is not as crowded compared to other locations (inside line and drive thru) because it's so far North Las Vegas. There is plenty of seating and the workers are friendly and efficient. I love getting my animal style burger with chopped peppers (changed the whole experience for me). I love the French fries here as they are but most my friends ask for their fries well done. Both are delicious! Nothing bad to say about this place, prices are cheap, place is always clean, there is plenty of outside seating, and will continue to be a regular."}
{"text":"It's alright, the food's a bit overrated. It is fresh, and the burgers probably have more 'real' meat in them than Jack in the Box, Wendy's, BK or McD.  This location is open to 1am five nights a week, 1.30am on Fridays or Saturdays. Kind of bizarre though, it's 2012 and they still only take Visa/MC. Get a new cc processor.  The In-N-Out Burger off Peoria and I-17 is a busier location during the daytime and dinner rush."}
{"text":"The food here's good and the employees are extremely nice. If you come here right before 10:30, you'll be the first in line. Otherwise, the lunch crowd starts at 10:45 and goes to about 1pm.  This is a great location but the placement of the building within the parking lot is questionable. You pull in and have to drive past it, then East to get into the drive through. Then, once out of the drive-through, you're basically at the front entrance and you have to drive all the way around the lot to get out. A better location would've been on a corner."}
{"text":"Food: 4 Lines: God-awful.  I had never had an In-N-Out Burger before, so I just had to stop by while on the West Coast.  I had a mouthwatering regular Hamburger, Animal Style (pickles, extra spread, grilled onions, mustard fried onto meat patty).  You definitely have to order something off the \"secret menu\", like \"Animal Style\", if you ever dine here.  Thanks for the tip, Yelpers!  The line was out the door when I arrived on a Sat. afternoon.  Makes sense, since it's the only In-N-Out Burger near the touristy Strip.  It moved as quickly as possible though, and everything was managed smoothly.  The drive-thru line was much shorter.  Clean BRs, btw.  I walked here, but don't do it by yourself, since it's kind of in a sketchy area.  If you walk here anyway, then at least do it during the daytime from the north side, along Vdara, Aria, etc., as opposed to the south side by Luxor."}
{"text":"Clean, very nice and service was quick! I now know why it was quick; my very thin hamburger patty was undercooked, really this should never be an issue here. I really like in and out and my hamburgers are always great!! It was 10:45 when we ordered so they were not busy at all.  Lastly, the hook in bathroom was broke and my purse fell on to the floor! Gross!!!"}
{"text":"Really, it doesn't matter where you are, In-N-Out Burger is the best fast food. The burgers are perfect, and the bun is toasted ever so slightly. The veggies are fresh, and you can actually SEE the people chopping the potatoes up to make french fries. They have the best shakes in the world, too."}
{"text":"I've been going to this In-N-Out for 8 years now! This is the place where I first discovered the deliciously fresh double-double burger. And let me tell you, it was definitely love at first sight! Staff here is wonderful. They're really nice (but then again, what In-N-Out staff ISN'T nice?!)!   Bottom line? Fresh and delicious food. And probably a bit tad healthier than your local McDonald's. Plus affordable prices? Definitely not a deal that I could pass up."}
{"text":"I am a burger guy and this place is better than average. No frills but the secret menu items make up for that. I wish we had a place like this in the Midwest but sadly we will go home to sub par fast food hamburgers."}
{"text":"Wow! Just opened yesterday morning and we were lucky enough to stop in for a bite before the rest of the area discovers they are open! Nice and clean and all the employees were so excited and happy! It was a pleasure to dine here!  Stuck with my usual combination of the awesome signature hamburger with fresh, hot fries and a creamy chocolate shake!   In N Out is always reliable, consistent and delicious! Whether you are simple like me, enjoy animal style, or a lettuce burger they are here to please with a friendly smile and attitude!   Keep it up In N Out, I am a fan for life!"}
{"text":"I'm a California Native and there is more of a nostalgic connection I have to In-N-Out Burger as I basically grew up on it. Their menu is ridiculously simple, prices are inexpensive, their ingredients truly are fresh and their atmosphere, no matter which store I go to, is always pleasant. My meal is pretty much the same every time, a cheeseburger with grilled onions, animal fries, and a regular drink. I sometimes add a Neapolitan shake on top of that, from their not-so-secret, secret menu. Always hits the spot for me!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with in-n-out. Even though you will be stuck in line forever (drive through and dining room),  But isn't that true of all locations?"}
{"text":"Thought this location seems close to the strip, get a taxi/Uber!  Super busy location but the staff handled it well. Got the protein burger animal style and an animal style hamburger and did not regret it. The type of lettuce used was crisp and fresh, not like your usual fast food chain lettuce. Also the cut of the tomato slice was a decent thickness. I would not waste time writing a review on a fast food chain but this is one of the few places worth my time.   This location is busier at night during the evening time. But the staff does a tremendous job in handling it.    **went during the holiday weekend**"}
{"text":"In-N-Out Burger is life...everlasting.  Whenever I'm in Vegas (visiting relatives and avoiding the strip, of course), I pop by In-N-Out at least twice, because we don't have them here in NY and are forced to choke down (or in my case- avoid) the factory farmed monstrosity that is McD's.  This location: is clean.  The service: so friendly and courteous.    The burgers & food: is  thebomb.com and dirt CHEAP!  The beef is freshly ground and juicy, the vegetables are plentiful and crunchy.   The sauce is pure love...and the fries are hot, crispy and with the right amount of salt.  And the shakes are heaven!  Thick, creamy, and top-quality.  My only warning to you my friends is that you drink it separately from your meal.  If you do not, your stomach will judge you forever.  My east coast friends- if you ever make a trip across the country, please visit the nearest In-N-Out...You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Burgers came out too fast, buns were cold & overcooked.  I asked for mustard & received only catsup.  Won't be in a hurry to return to this Carefree location."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick bite on a budget this is the place! I have never had a bad burger from this In-N-Out, and the fries here are pretty good too. Sometimes the wait for the drive-thru can be extensive as many people don't want to get out of the car AC in the summer heat (I don't blame them)!   Double double - hold the onions, and extra crispy fries. I also like the burger protein-style, which is no bun but wrapped in lettuce. Messy, but yummy! I've never tried animal style, but hear good things... maybe that should be next on my bucket list. :)"}
{"text":"45 wait wow not in CALIFORNIA no shakes machine broke  gill  down  he only bucause  we love the food well we need to love it in CALIFORNIA only"}
{"text":"The place is always, always packed. There are locals, taxi drivers, limos, every type of patron lined up inside and in the drive-thru. Blame it on the location (close to the strip).  As per every other In-N-Out, service is quick and friendly. Everything is done with practiced ease and efficiency. They rarely make a mistake in the drive-thru window as well, which is amazing considering the volume of customers.  I always get #2 (cheeseburger with fries and a drink) but make the fries animal style. With banana peppers. Ace!! Such a west coast classic.  Good luck finding seating during peak hours though!"}
{"text":"In N Out is the ONLY fast food place I'll eat a hamburger from. I pride myself on the fact that I've never eaten a McDonald's or a Burger King hamburger before.   My order is always the same: double double, grilled onions, protein style. 9/10 times, that's all I'll order. Unfortunately because of this location's proximity to the Strip, it is a madhouse at all times. I work about a mile from here and I get 30 minutes for lunch. More than once I've made it back with zero minutes to spare. Once I was 5 minutes late. If it takes more 35 minutes to get a single hamburger, there is a problem. They're too busy for their own good.   The food is spot on but the droves of people make it nearly impossible to find a place to sit. If you are pressed for time, don't even think of coming between the hours of 3pm-8pm whatsoever, on any day of the week."}
{"text":"East coast visitor in search of the infamous west coast burger. Lets just say thank goodness there's a GPS and map app on our cell phones nowadays or I might have starved to death in the desert.  This location seems to be easier to get to from everywhere.  (For outsiders, don't let \"Tempe\" fools you, it's closer to Scottsdale and Phoenix than the other ones)  I was told of the not so secret secret menu. So I went and got a cheeseburger animal style. We ordered one order of fries to share and a milkshake. The fries is big enough to share, and is the less impressive item.  Don't know if it is as lightly fried everywhere else, but I like my fries crunchier.  The most impressive thing is the price.  My cheeseburger was $2.20.  It's not a huge burger but it filled me up just fine.  The entire meal was just over $10 with tax for 2.   The menu is simple. And the amount of employees with their cute little white uniforms and the hats are abundant. So even though it was packed the service was fast.   Guess I am now on the In-N-Out bandwagon.  Now if they can open one up in my neck of the woods..."}
{"text":"This place has horrible customer service. we were on line and I was told the grill was turned off. The manager Yvette ya shoreline customer service skill. Super disappointedly"}
{"text":"Everyone loves In-n-Out. Great burgers.  Clean your damn tables though.   That is all."}
{"text":"Hot fresh burger what else can I say worth a visit I don't eat fast food often had to eat here couple days in a row, a burger I enjoyed,"}
{"text":"So good, can't wait to fly back & get another round!"}
{"text":"Great burger and chips place. Everything is so fresh and delicious. Drive through is always busy and you wish that they had a second drive through system."}
{"text":"I LOVE In-N-Out, but tonight they did not live up to their name.  This was the longest I have ever had to wait at the drive thru.  I am not sure what they hold up was with my food, but the cashier was very friendly and apologetic.  Thankfully the food was VERY fresh and delicious as ever."}
{"text":"It is so tough to give a 5 star review of a fast food restaurant....But considering they have such a small menu, but are willing to make your food almost any way you want it, I can't help it!  In N Out does burgers.  That's it.  You aren't going to come here and find a fancy chicken sandwich or an expensive salad.  On the menu are just a few things:  a hamburger, a single cheeseburger and the famous Double Double cheeseburger.  There are also french fries, shakes and sodas, along with pink lemonade.  Everything is made fresh, so you can feel good knowing that it hasn't been roasting under some red light for hours, waiting for your order.  The kitchen is very open, so you can actually see the staff making your food to order.  Very refreshing to know that they aren't running some secret operation back there!  The french fries are cut fresh daily.  Although they are wonderful ordered as-is, you can also ask to have them \"light,\" which makes them a little softer/soggier, or \"well,\" which will serve them extra crispy (my favorite).  There is only 1 size order, and there are more than enough fries to share!  As many of you may know, there is a not so secret menu here.  The most popular thing is probably to order your burger \"animal style.\"  The beef patty is covered in mustard prior to cooking, then topped with lettuce, tomoato, pickle, extra spread and grilled onions.  It is even possible to get your fries animal style!  So overboard, but something to try at least once!  My Mom doesn't like all the fixings on her burger, so she simply orders a 2x2, which is 2 beef patties and 2 slices of cheese, with spread.  You can order a 3x3 or a 4x4 as well!  If you don't like meat, you can order a grilled cheese, which is basically a single without the meat.  If you are watching your carbs, order your burger \"protein style,\" which is a cheeseburger wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun.  The service is always friendly and they ensure your order is RIGHT.  The line may look long, but usually it moves quickly.  At the window you can ask for extra spread and they will put packets in your bag.  You can also order \"chiles,\" and they give you small packages of hot peppers.  I think that the biggest attraction to this place is that the food is unavailable almost everywhere.  With locations in California, Nevada and Arizona, people travel from everywhere for a taster of the goodness!  I understand some of the negative reviews, because after all, it is a fast food joint...But, if I am in a hurry, I would much rather eat here than Jack in the Box or Taco Bell, where you don't even know what you are eating!"}
{"text":"Food looked great. The burger was good. Lack of lettuce. Fries were so hard it hurt to eat them. And way too salty. Gross."}
{"text":"There are a lot of life mysteries we question everyday. Are we alone in the universe? Does Bigfoot really exist? Is In-N-Out Burger actually that good? Well we may not have the answers to some of these conundrums for a while (unless you've recently been abducted by aliens), but I was able to find a conclusion to that last one.  So maybe I was late to the proverbial party, but I hadn't had the opportunity to try In-N-Out for the first time until I ended up in Nevada back in September. The trek to this spot from Las Vegas Blvd is not as straightforward as one might hope, but I do pray someone reads this review and learns it is walkable, I promise!  Once there, you'll start to get this feeling like you're entering into a genuine food experience. I mean the place isn't spectacularly designed, but between the retro logo and little palm trees across the counter, you get this subtle Californian vibe you didn't know you wanted and you're glad you got.  The line was several people deep, but In-N-Out is a well-oiled machine and lives up to its name with the way it takes orders, calls out numbers, and keeps people moving. Plus, you can't really spend a while choosing because the menu is basic. Burger, Cheeseburger, Double Double (you can figure that one out), fries, and shakes.   Okay, I'm no food novice. There's a little more to that menu than meets the eye, and I wasn't about to miss out on it. Animal style fries? Check. Neapolitan shake? Check. Throw in a Double Double and we're good....well, maybe I let my eyes do the talking because I also added a hamburger to that order (more on its unfortunate demise in a sec).  Verdict? Really good. Aesthetically, the Double Double was beautiful and it stayed together nicely through each juicy, meaty bite. The flavors blended perfectly and created a fast food burger above the caliber of most others. Beyond that staple, I did enjoy my beastly fries, though they fell a tad short of my expectations. I mean cheese, grilled onions, and their secret spread still tasted great on top of it all so don't shy away from this secret selection. The shake rounded things out nicely with its trio of flavors.   Overall, I'm glad to have an answer to that edible life question: In-N-Out Burger is good. I'd say it's even great. Amazing? Maybe not, but I do wish my stomach was big enough to have eaten that extra burger. He met an untimely end in a garbage can along The Strip because I just couldn't eat anymore. Looking back, I wish I did because I'm craving some more In-N-Out and I'll be waiting til my next opportunity to continue to fulfill that food fantasy."}
{"text":"In-N-Out never disappoints. Best fast food burger ever.  I ALWAYS get the same thing and it comes out to be delicious everytime.  I get a cheeseburger animal style with fries well done (I like them crispier) and a cup of water. Once my order is out, I ask for two packets of special sauce (it's their 'thousand island' sauce although I don't think its thousand island). Lately, I learned about the chilli peppers on the side so I add that on. I like the squeeze the juice from the chilli peppers onto my well done fries so there's a kick to it.  I love my food with a slight kick and spiciness, it makes things exciting and boost my metabolism a slight bit!  Random factoid about In-N-Out: bottom of their wrappers, they have bible relevations on it."}
{"text":"Whenever I travel to the west coast I have to stop at an In and Out. Very simple menu but delicious burgers! Probably one of my favorite fast food joints. I only wish we had them in Chicago. They definitely blow away any burger from McDonalds. This location in particular was very crowded and we did wait a long time for our food because there was so many people. I'm guessing it's because it's right off the strip."}
{"text":"Nice pleasant drive thru attendant.  Quick and efficient service.  They ask if you're eating in the car and offer you a lap mat (see picture).  I like to ask for grilled onions and extra spread.  They are always obliging.  Plus, the food is good. Duh."}
{"text":"\"MMMM. THIS IS. A TASTY BURGER.\" - Jules. Pulp Fiction.  I like this place, my siblings like this place, and it's the best thing I've got to remembering better times back home in California.   It's a quick fix for people who want good burgers at a decent price. It always hits the spot when I'm feeling like a fatty. :)  Even considered biking all the way here from my house when my car was dead and going through the drive through. (Coz the cool kids did it back then... In CA anyway haha. And employees didn't care.) I agree that drive thru is an atrociously long wait during the afternoon (after school).  Peeps who work here seem pretty chill since I always ALWAYS, ask them for the hats and throw dozens and dozens of ketchup packets in with my to-go orders. Biiiiiiiiiiig plus!"}
{"text":"The best burger I've ever had. Reasonable prices too and nice staff. If you are really hungry make sure to get the animal fries."}
{"text":"1-star review because they forgot your fries? That stuff happens, what matters HERE is how the food was.  In-N-Out is a SoCal institution, STILL family-owned by the Snyder family for their entire history.. every location is company-owned, there are NO franchises and no \"big corporation\" behind the brand.  Simply put, this is THE best fast-food burger in the land, bar none, IMHO and of many, many others.  They use nothing but fresh ingredients - nothing is ever frozen - and their employees are the best in the industry, no doubt the fact that they're the best-paid in the industry has something to do with that.  If you've never had one - drop by for a Double-Double and experience true burger bliss."}
{"text":"The burger is 5 star greatness.  It's juicy, packed with flavor and leaves you wanting more of that flavor.  What more can be said about a perfect burger? The place however sucks and they need to make it larger.  It gets way too packed there.  However service was friendly and we received our burger in about 7-10 mins."}
{"text":"Normally this location is crazy busy but we lucked out this time. The food was ready quickly and of course it has the great taste we expected. We will be back."}
{"text":"Sometimes you want to eat fast and cheap, and this is one of the places to go. I think for a fast food chain, In-N-Out is probably one of the best.  Only drawback is that sometimes you need to wait on lines, especially during the busy hours (around 1pm to 3pm). The food is consistent, so no surprises!"}
{"text":"Does it get better? So far I can honestly tell you it doesn't. A double double animal style, same way fries, a mixed vanilla chocolate shake and a girl is really all you need in this world.  The meat is great quality when you consider the price you're paying and the combination of sauce, meet, cheese and buns is what makes it. Everything is just balanced out so well and that includes the shake. And as long as you got your significant other sitting with you and enjoying tasty heaven, well that makes it that much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"0030 on a Friday morning, and In N Out delivered after a 3-hr airline arrival delay! The fare was excellent, of course. You can always rely on In N Out to deliver their food fresh and hot. What also impresses me are the work crews. No one can be jazzed about working a food gig after midnight, but these employees were serving up the chow w/ smiles and a pleasant attitude.  I've always wonder what their employee hiring model is, because In N Out crews are always top notch, and I appreciate that.  Cheers! RS"}
{"text":"This burger is ok. It is not the dreamy burger everyone rants about. The fries are pretty good though."}
{"text":"I've been to their restaurants in Dallas and they were just ok.  But in Vegas, I see what In-N-Out is all about and why it's worth all of the hype.  Spotlessly clean restaurant, friendly employees, and the food was freshly cooked and cooked to order.  Definitely worth the hype.  Here's hoping that the rumored new locations in Austin can live up to Vegas standards.   A special thanks for real iced tea with real lemons!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out always makes a good burger.  What makes this In-N-Out special on my visit on September 12 was Nathan.  Having been at the EMS Expo in Vegas, I was wearing an EMS t-shirt.  When I placed my order, Nathan asked if I was on duty so he could have the kitchen put my order out first.   That's one of the kindest gestures I've ever received from a fast food joint.   Plus, the #1 combo is still the stuff of awesomeness."}
{"text":"Amazing In-N-Out ! So clean and nice and all the staff is wonderful! Probably the best IN-N-Out I have had !! If you are staying near here I definitely recommend stopping in. I got my burger Animal Style and my fries well done !!"}
{"text":"I could never give inn n out less then 5 stars but this one is the slowest one iv ever been to I don car though still worth the wait"}
{"text":"Off the charts burgers, fantastic service and you can see your food being prepared.  I am happy my office is across the street.  World famous In-N-Out Burger is still the best.  Love the secret menu, the smooth shakes and the fresh cut fries.  Mid day has the least crowds."}
{"text":"Pretty good service. Good price for a meal.   The downsides are: long lines + missing sitting places."}
{"text":"Oh In-N-Out. How I miss you so. But for now, I will just cherish the moments when I regularly had a grilled cheese with animal style fries and a milkshake. The next time I'm in Vegas, we will be reunited and it will be a beautiful thing."}
{"text":"Second time at an In-n-Out Burger and it was just as good as the other day. We got in just before the lunchtime rush and all of us ordered the Double Double with shakes. One of my co-workers got his burger Animal Style.   This place was spotless, we had great service, and the food was outstanding. I'm gonna need to run a marathon to burn off the food I've eaten here, but THIS was well worth it."}
{"text":"It must have been 20 years since I last ate at an In-n-Out Burger...and it was worth the wait. Certainly not the healthiest choice for lunch, but it was a requirement of this trip.   If you're gonna do it...do it right. A double/double with onions, a side of fries and a chocolate shake. I mean, damn that's a good friggin' lunch.  I know that everyone says this is the best burger chain around...and if it isn't, it's certainly in the top five I've tried.   I was amazed watching the workers in this place. They were busting their butts as a steady stream of people came through the door and drive-thru and not a single one of them looked like they were in a crappy mood. I don't know why, but they all seemed to be pretty happy working there...says something about how they treat their jobs and how the job treats them."}
{"text":"What can I say about In-N-Out Burger that hasn't been said?  We all know these delishicious west coast burgers are the envy of all East Coasters and you know what... I'm ok with that.    Let me tell you a little story about a wedding.  As a pre-wedding party, the soon to be newly appointed MR. and MRS. Thought it would be a good idea to order 100 burgers, quarter them and serve them as appitizers as part of a pre wedding party in a massive suite with a giant deck overlooking the strip.    When we (and I'm not the MR in the equation, jut a helpful friend)  went to the place the order, the guy at the counter was in shock.  He looked like he wanted to say.  \"Wait.. How many?  You know if you eat that many, there is a high possibility that you might die of a hard attack.\"  Dont worry my good man,  these burgers (some animal style and some not) will be disbursed among the good people that came to Las Vegas to watch us get wed.  So yeah,  Me, the MR and MRS ordered about 100 burgers.  But thats not the best part.  We arranged to pick up these burgers at 8pm that night.  So what do we do.  Order a burger right then and there, fully knowing that there would be plenty to go round later.   I love my friends."}
{"text":"The one that started it all for me. The original, my one true love, my heart, mi amor. Double double animal style is the be-all and end-all of fast food burgers. Cheap, fast, open late, and quality every single time. It's my first stop after I land and my last stop before I fly out. I'll see you soon bae."}
{"text":"You folks out West have no idea what you have. Sure, us Easterners have Five Guys and Five Guys is okay - they have more toppings options like grilled mushrooms and jalapenos. But the meat and the cheese and the fries at In-N-Out are better.  So when I was out in Phoenix, I made it a point to stop at an In-N-Out for my dose of double-double. It was just as good as the last time, when I had one at a drive-through in Burbank CA.  Yumminess!  I'm taking off a star because there isn't an In-N-Out for over 1000 miles. Seriously, guys. Bring it to us! We'll make it worth your while and when you do, I'll bump this up to five stars."}
{"text":"10/10 fast food. Service here was great. The cashier kept calling ma'am and madame, I felt so old but I'm pretty sure we were like the same age haha."}
{"text":"This place has saved me from many hungry nights. Definitely a place my east coast friends always bug me to take them when they're visiting town. I always get the double burger animal style with chili peppers, delicious!"}
{"text":"In-N-Out has claimed its spot as my favorite fast food restaurant.  It's just too bad there are none on the east coast.  While on a recent trip to Las Vegas, my husband and I stopped in for lunch, neither of us having tried the franchise before.  I couldn't believe how packed the place was, but I knew it was a good sign.  We both got our cheeseburgers \"animal-style\", which was such a nice dimension to already delicious burgers.  The burgers had a real fresh flavor too, unlike other fast food restaurants.  Fries were excellent, some of the best I've had.  Food is cheap compared to places like McDonald's, and you get plenty of food to fill you up.  This is quality fast food at a great value!"}
{"text":"\"In-n-Out, In-n-Out, that's what a hamburger's all about!\"   I grew up on this place in California and was thrilled when they finally opened several years back in Arizona. Their food is always fresh and always prepared exactly the way you want it. I love that every employee you interact is incredibly friendly and repeats the order back to you to make certain they have it correctly.  The lines can be long, but they are always worth it. Even though their patties have shrunk a little over the years, the Double Double is perfect if you need that big meat fix."}
{"text":"I  waited in a line wrapped around the building for over 20 minutes at 730pm on a Wednesday.  I thought it would be worth the wait.  When I  finally got though the line my order was wrong.  Was not going to wait another 20 minutes for a correction.  What happened to you In and Out?   You used to be so awesome.."}
{"text":"This In and Out is right across from my hotel, the Aloft Tempe.  It is what a burger place should be, a bunch of young teenagers who take pride in their first jobs.  $2 for a great cheeseburger, $6 for a combo w great fries and a milk shake is worthy of a last meal.  The burgers put the high priced burgers in Manhattan NYC to shame---Ray's Hell Burger wannabes.  In and Out is a throwback to a time when fast food was about quality and affordability.  This place qualifies for Hall of Fame All Madden status.  I miss those days after swimming in a meet or playing in a basketball game where we would go out for burgers and shakes.  It doesn't get better than In and Out!  Arizona Baby!!"}
{"text":"This burger place recently opened up in our neck-of-the-woods and we couldn't be anymore delighted. For us, it's our brunch-date, just us two while we are out running errands.   My husband is a vegetarian so this may not seem like a place he should visit. Unless you know that they have grilled cheese on the \"secret\" menu. Oops, maybe I let our a little secret, but that sandwich is damn good! It's basically a burger (yup all the toppings) without the meat. We get ours with grilled onions....YUMMY!"}
{"text":"My husband frequents here for their Grilled Cheese...secret menu...shhh!"}
{"text":"I love In-n-Out and miss not having one near by. Everyone time we can stop and have a double double we do. LOVE!!!"}
{"text":"Double double with cooked in chilies; fries and a soda.  Amazing.  Build one of these in Albuquerque, NM right now!"}
{"text":"Basically the Holy Grail of burgers!! I had the animal style everything. Loved it single beautiful bite of it. And flushed it down with a perfectly carbonated Dr. Pepper. Bliss!   I only knocked one star off because I have to fly 2500 to get there :("}
{"text":"In the chaos of a insane lunch rush Cory helped his whole team to ensure the flow went very smoothly and friendly with employees and guests alike!"}
{"text":"We always go to in and out burger and enjoy their food tremendously. Unfortunately at this location they allowed a large dog to enter the restaurant and even after complaints they ignored the customers and let the dog stay in the restaurant. This was shocking to see. We have a great deal of respect for in and out but this really affected our view of them."}
{"text":"This location sucks. By default four stars because well, it's in n out. Second time my order has been wrong.   She repeated \"animal style fry\" back to me but did not charge it. So they came out normal. I said they were supposed to be animal. They then wanted me to wait in the enormous line again to pay for the animal style upgrade.   Didn't bother. Just took the fries as is. I get they are busy. But it only takes two seconds to make sure what you said is what you ring up."}
{"text":"What's going on the meat was so small,must want to order double hamburgers and no pickles, so disappointed, place was half full,lots of disappointed people I'm sure"}
{"text":"I don't know if I'm just crazy, hungry, or cheap but are the cheeseburgers here cheaper than in California?? Anyway, one was $2.25 and I was definitely pleased with the price. Though I can't exactly say I was full, I did eat half of my sister's fries to compensate for it. My friends and I wanted a cheap meal before we went all out splurgy on the buffets and it definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"Went through the drive-thru thursday 7-9-15 around 6pm. Got a double double with no onions, cheese fries, and a vanilla millshake ($10.00). Service was fast and friendly as always. Food was good. Not much else to tell lol"}
{"text":"MMMMM!!! Went last night 5-3-15 and got dinner.   I had a #1 with animal style fries and a strawberry shake instead of a drink.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"If you've never eaten In-N-Out... Yes it's as good as people say. I'm from the east coast and I've had dreams about it when I'm away from it. I prefer my burger straight up but get the fries animal style. The fries aren't my ABSOLUTE fav, but you will not find a better burger from a drive thru window in the entire country. Trust me, I've tried."}
{"text":"In N Out has always been a favorite. Upon arrival as expected the line was really long. A real nice girl was walking to cars in the drive thru to speed up the ordering process and it sure helped. I was greeted by a nice guy named Alex who was extremely welcoming and all the employees seemed to enjoy working there. It was nice to have great customer service and a pleasant fast food experience. The animal style Double Double is delicious and the fries are tasty. My little ones had a plain burger and fries. Thanks for being a family favorite Inn N Out!"}
{"text":"Meh nothing special not sure what all the hype was about I mean the burger and fries were tasty but nothing special in fact I can't think of anything that really stood out except the crunchy fresh onion"}
{"text":"What kind of In n Out customer would I be if I didn't review this place? I'm a Las Vegas native and this in n out was part of my childhood for as long as I can remember! I have this place 5 stars of course. I have never had a mess up order or an employee ever be unprofessional. They are prompt and very well spoken. I always order a double double with grilled onions and fries. Two patties two pieces of cheese, delicious sauce and veggies. Their burgers are always consistent, fresh and taste exactly the same. The fries are great too, they are not too salty and the taste is very appealing. I love the fact anytime I step into In n Out I know EXACTLY the quality of service and food I will be receiving. This place will always be a favorite of mine. They do an awesome job! I am a proud paying customer!"}
{"text":"Bomb food, line moves very quickly during busy times. I've been through the drive through on multiple occasions and the customer service is top notch, always smiling!"}
{"text":"Tom Hanks loves In-N-Out.  That should be good enough for folks to check out In-N-out. The secret menu isn't so secret. But it's so much fun to order.  Double Double Animal Style is my go-to.  Lettuce, Tomato, Pickles, Mustard grilled patty, cheese and spread. Fresh ingredients, made to order so expect a short wait, especially in the drive thru lane.  The Double Double can be a mess to eat, but so delicious.  And don't be ashamed if you end up taking a nap afterward. At least there were some veggies involved!  I tried Animal Style fries for the first time here. (Spread, cheese and grilled onions top your fries)  Eh, I'll stick with Animal Style burgers and regular fries. The spread on the fries kind of turned me off.   Service here is friendly and I think they repeated my order at least 3 times, once at order booth, another time at pay window and again when I picked up my order.  Don't want to mess up those Animal Style orders I guess!"}
{"text":"It's in and out-burgers are great and inexpensive.  even our 2 year old grandson loves it."}
{"text":"Perfection. A million times better than Fatburger, Freddy's, or 5 guys."}
{"text":"I'm convinced that the people who work at In-N-Out are either robots or being force fed antidepressants. They're the happiest food service people I have ever met - EVER!   I love the fact that In-N-Out's menu is so simple. I don't have to decide between 87 combo meals, or what sides I want. I get a choice of 4 burgers and fries, and that's that.   I got the protein style burger to work around my gluten free diet, and the lettuce was fresh, burger  tasty, and did I mention that the service was SUPER FRIENDLY! !"}
{"text":"By chance the Vietnamese restaurant that we frequented for three 3 years was closing earlier than usual. Understandably, the hours sign read OPEN 10 AM to (number rubbed out) on the left glass door entrance. Just as we opened their door, they screamed from the counter across the restaurant WE'RE CLOSED!  We drove to where cars were lining up south across the parking lot, bright lit IN - OUT BURGER. I ordered the plain \"double cheese\", which I thought would be President Trump ' favorite and a #2, BOTH WITHOUT ONIONS. We enjoyed our meal and was fully satisfied, NOT TOO SALTY, just done right! Everyone from the Angeline, the patient young lady bundled up outside taking orders, to the pretty boyish looking  Redhead cashier who asked for $10.28, to the plump beauty who handed us our 7 - up and asked if we wanted some ketchup; to the only tan skinned pretty Latina who handed me our burgers and fries in a bag.  FOR SURE WE'LL BE COMING BACK FROM NOW ON!"}
{"text":"Good services and awesome animal style fries. Always enjoy getting a root beer and everyone is really nice working at this location and very friendly. Animal style burger was perfect. Next time going to see if they do root beer float like they do in San Diego. Recommend going to this location if your near by."}
{"text":"I woke up bleary eyed from after the second night of my Vegas bender and thought \"TODAY is THE DAY for my first In-n-Out burger.\" So, without shower or makeup touch up, I walked to the convention I was supposed to be attending for about 5 seconds, turned around, walked to the front of the Venetian, hailed a cab and said \"To the closest In-n-Out burger please!\" Then I let the cabbie work his magic while I sat in the back trying not to throw up on his seats. Good start to the day!   We make it there and sit in the drive through. There was an employee in the parking lot with a computerized handheld thing taking orders. I told him I'd never been before so he explained what they have...burgers, burgers, burgers. I ordered a double double with no onions or special sauce (I don't like special sauce...I mean, I like my boyfriend's special sauce but it fortunately doesn't taste like Thousand Island dressing. Thank God!), fries, and the largest freakin diet coke they could give me. I was surprised at how freakin FRIENDLY all these mo' fo's working here were....every one of them was all smiles and thank yous and come agains. Wow, sure beats the grim faces of McDonalds!   I got back to the Venetian and after finding my room in that labyrinth of a complex I sat down to eat. Burger - YESS! Yummers! Definitely trumps all other fast food burgers. Thick, juicy, meaty patties and a really great bun. Everything tasted fresh too which was a definite step up. Does it trump my fave burger joint? No, but it trumps Whataburger, McDonald's, Wendy's, etc. I would say it trumps Burger King but I never go there so I don't know. The fries were undersalted and not as crispy as I like them so there's the minus one star. And the drink was cold and restorative after a night out boozing it up like a rockstar.   I wish they would put one of these on the strip somewhere so that I could go without spending $20 on a cab ride and $6 on food but I think for my first experience it was SO worth the money and I'd do it again in a second!"}
{"text":"In N Out has always been love at first taste. A must know for newbies- eat the fries first, they're not as good after cooling off.  I love the shakes, and there burgers are so simple, yet soo amazing. The employees are super friendly with cute hats. I love that they do protein style, and the secret menu is fun.  Warning- I've never once been to an In n Out,  at anytime of day/night that wasn't packed. It's almost part of the ambiance. :)"}
{"text":"In n Out always hits the spot. Cant say anything bad about it, other than sometimes it gets way too crowded. But other than that, its my favorite burger joint. My friends suggest 5 Guys burgers is better, but I will be the judge of that once I try it."}
{"text":"Its In N Out. Read any of my other reviews on this great establishment....lol."}
{"text":"Never ceases to fulfill. I Always stop on my way to or from Flagstaff...some BOTH to and from... Always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Speedy and quality service Drive thru is super fast. They do need to work in stocking and cleaning the soda machines and dining room."}
{"text":"Great double burger that came out super fresh."}
{"text":"Still delicious!  Only fast food place I consider dinner and open late so I can actually make there before close."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place out after constantly hearing all the hype about it. And I have to say it's pretty much just hype. The burgers are small, and pretty basic, the fries weren't great, the shakes were, well, shakes. Nothing special at all.  The menu is simple and the prices are cheap, which is nice. And the foods not bad. But just WAYYYY over hyped. Smash burger is a lot better. And right across the street. Go there and try that lol"}
{"text":"I *still* don't see what the big deal is with In-N-Out. Everyone I know is in love with them but I just don't see what the big deal is. If you love mayo - the \"secret sauce\" - then maybe you'll like your burger. They don't have bacon on the menu and I ended up getting a double with just ketchup, and it was barely better than a McD's burger. And very greasy.  The fries were just okay.  Service was good, tho."}
{"text":"All my life I've heard that in-n-out is the end all be all of hamburger joints. That there's no way I could any further in my life without visiting one. Every time I go to Vegas I hear \"You HAVE to go to In-N-Out\".   Well we were going to Goodyear Park and wanted to stop here since they were nearby. I'll give it to them, they were packed at 11am on a Saturday.  But I wasn't impressed. The burger and fries were just \"okay\". Nothing to write home about or that I'd have to tell the world about (which I guess I'm doing right now). I know 5 Guys came after In-N-Out, but I felt like 5 Guys just does it better. You can actually order TOPPINGS. Crazy, I know.  All in all, I'd try them again, but don't know that I'd go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Another addition to Las Vegas, NV Opening day is set for Wednesday January 11, 2017 @ 10:30am"}
{"text":"They have a tasty burger for under  $4. How Tasty? Well, I would say better than other fast food burgers I have had, and at least as enjoyable as some more expensive ones I have had  (looking at you, Gordon Ramsay burger). It otherwise looks and feels like a fairly standard fast food place, except with a larger and friendlier staff than expected."}
{"text":"After living on the dreadful east coast the last 6 years, the first burger joint I visited while vacationing in Vegas is the one and only In-N-Out!  I lived in San Diego nearly 20 years ago and always loved this place.  After all this time, this place didn't let me down.  Was busy as all get it out but that was expected.  Burger and fries were on point.  Until we meet again In-N-Out (let's not make it 20 years again)...."}
{"text":"Grew up around the corner from the original In-N-Out in So Calif. So, the smell and taste of the burgers always makes me nostalgic for home. Reminds me of Sundays with my family sitting on the stone benches in the southern california sun enjoying the juicy burgers.  Best fast food burger I've ever found. I always get the double-double with cheese and onions and a side of fries, all for less than six dollars! Cant beat the price or the flavor. I actually crave their burger and fries.  And, the nicest customer service in any drive thru I have encountered in Las Vegas. You guys Rock!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty awesome IN N OUT! Its the largest one in Las Vegas as of now. Its right off the I15 freeway and West Tropicana on Dean Martin Drive.   I've passed it many times, but the line is always super long so I go to the one on Maryland Pkwy by UNLV. But, since it was a little late at night, I decided to withstand the long drive thru line. Its so busy that an employee is taking orders on foot 20 cars deep from the front. Its cool I dont mind. It was worth the wait once I get those fries in my mouth for the drive home. Always got to eat the fries as you drive!  Quality is 5 Stars and the price is best value for your money. And, the employees are 'cut from a special mold'. Seems at every IN N OUT I have been to, the employees are super exceptional and trained in courteous customer service. Always friendly too.  Favorite fast-food burger of all time! Fan/Customer for life.."}
{"text":"It's a clean, friendly, yummy place for the famous In N Out taste. Don't forget the hidden menu- get it animal style."}
{"text":"It's just like every other In-N-Out Burger.  This particular location was packed with people at 1PM.  I ordered the Double Double Animal style and was not disappointed.  Although they have a huge line it moves quick and you get your food in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"Great food as always just the slowest drive thru of any of the in n outs in the area."}
{"text":"In-N-Out burgers are way over rated. It must be a west coast thing. Would not stop again, no matter how hungry I am."}
{"text":"thank goodness i know about animal style. it was my first time having in N out since i'm from the east coast and we dont have any here! the burger was juicy and delicious and perfectly compiled of onions, lettuce, tomato, and thousand island dressing, with a non frozen beef patty! animal style is not advertised on the menu but order it like that and you won't regret it! their fries are yummy too! i wish i had a box to fly home with me! delicious lunch and ample seating at this location!"}
{"text":"I mean, this place knows the science of burgery.  The many times I've been to Vegas, I've always missed the opportunity to try this place out.    Finally had a few hours to kill before my flight left and decided to make a pit stop here with a buddy of mine.  He was broke from the Vegas shenanigans so I offered to front the bill.  Between him and I, we had to double doubles (made mine animal or something), two sodas, and split an order of fries.  This only cost about $15, not a bad deal.  Not an extensive menu to choose from and after asking the guy at the counter, it was pretty straight forward to figure out.  Basically, how hungry are you?  Explained a little further down, I should have opted in for the choice below the double double, but I have no regrets.  The wait wasn't excruciating, granted we stepped in and ordered before a herd of about 20 people rolled in, but it was about a 5 minute wait to get the order.  Fries were meh...tasted like 10 minute old McDonalds fries, which is still good but meh.  THE BURGERS, MY GOD!  I don't know their trick but the patty was kinda crunchy on the very edges and just the right amount of greasy.  I can compare the taste to Elevation Burgers free range burgers, if anyone is familiar with them, they are in my top choice of burger joints.  My buddy had no trouble polishing off his double double but, sadly, i was a bite and a half from being able to finish before my stomach finally told me that my eyes were bigger than it was.  This is going to be the new tradition of being the first or last stop in my Vegas trips.  I can't believe it took me 6 trips to Vegas to even try it out.  My dumb self should have listened to my other friends the first time I visited and made the time for this piece of Valhalla."}
{"text":"Met up to all the expectations; burger was very fresh, lettuce was fresh, tomatoes fresh, bun was fresh. Fries will take some getting used to, not used to having such clean  french fries they must you some very clean oil there. Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a second review at a different location. Same high-quality food as the previous location however I ordered the animal fries they were obnoxious very flavorful but they had too many ingredients for me. The double cheeseburger was to die for very juicy and probably one of the best burgers I've ever had! Will always visit this chain when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"i freaking LOVE in and out burgers. theyre double double is awesome and they have great shakes. get it animal style!"}
{"text":"If you've been to an In-n-Out then you can expect the same great taste and quality at this location. The place can get pretty busy during peak hours, but food still comes out pretty fast. The only downside is this last visit, they skimped a little on the veggie toppings."}
{"text":"always a pleasure. the animal style sauce on everything is always my go to. the fries taste better and healthier than mcdonalds and the tomatoes and lettuce also of a fresher quality. do not recommend going during lunch or dinner hours to avoid the wait. overall a great fastfood chain and great place to eat in the westcoast"}
{"text":"The food here is so satisfying to my taste buds. The fries are so perfectly not salted I'm unnecessary salt  always always ALWAYS satisfied"}
{"text":"Secret menu items!?!?!  Drat.  I'm always the last to know.    We didn't have Ian's secret, but that was still a damn good burger.  I had a cheeseburger single with the thousand island dressing.  I was skeptical, but was in love at first bite.  And the fries, fresh cut.  Oh mama.  If you find yourself anywhere in AZ or CA you definitely want to find one of these.  Now only if I could get them to come East..."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE place to get a burger! You must order the double double with animal sauce and try their shake! I personally wasn't a fan of their animal fries but they are very popular. Their shakes are delicious and extremely rich and creamy. They offer chili peppers which are my favorite to put on top of the burger. You can't beat these prices at $3.45 for a double double, $2.45 fries and $2.45 milkshakes! Definitely a must try when on the west coast!"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers, fries, and shakes.  -1 star for having employees stand around at cars for orders.  Would rather just review the menu at my leisure and order at the mic when ready, rather than than have an employee stand and stare at you while you decide."}
{"text":"Every trip to Vegas has to have an In N Out run.  Somehow cheap and quality can go in the same sentence when talking about In N Out.  AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I havent eat a burger eversince i rmbr.. This totally out of my diet... I told myself if im gona eat a burger again im goin to this place.....so here i come!!! Im excited to eat a burger with grilled onions and thier thousand island sauce is the best.....yayyyyy!!!!!!"}

Place is packed on a Saturday afternoon, gotta hunt for that spot.  Food   Appetizer - None     Main Course - I went with a hidden menu item today.  I ordered the #2 cheeseburger with animal style, truly the only way to go at In-N-Out.  The burger was perfect.    Dessert - None  Service - They slipped here today.  I was number 44, which they would call out and indicate you food is ready.  Next thing I here is 47, then skipping 44 - 46.  Then 45 is called.  Then a confused customer was looking at my order, then 44 was called, and he drifted back to his spot.  Glad this was not a bingo game and the wrong number being called.  Future - Sure will."}

We have never been to this In-N-Out Burger location before.  Atmosphere - Cookie cutter layout with the retro feel.  The walls and counters are done in whites and reds.  It is early and the place was very clean and had no problem finding a spot to sit, but before we left another group was sitting in our spot before we made it out the door.  Food   Appetizer - None, do they really have any?     Main Course - I was going to order whole grilled onions on my cheeseburger the next time I went to In-N-Out but I forgot, looking back I was glad.  I got my normal, cheeseburger animal style.  This had to be the thickest animal style burger I have ever had. So yummy!    Dessert - None, do they really have any?  Service - We walked up and the cashier was doing something with a credit card and the till, just strange.  He indicated he would be right with us.  But with a few seconds another cashier got his till going and took our order.  Always fast friend service.  I saw one of the oldest employees I have ever seen at any In-N-Out Burger, probably a little order then me, he was also a Mets fan, and I had a Mets t-shirt and my 59fifty 50th anniversary hat on.    Future - Sure"}
{"text":"So this place is basically McDonalds on the West Coast, but just burgers. I'm from the East Coast, so this was my first experience with the famous In-N-Out Burger, which I found to be a lot of hype so we went there on 2/12/13. My friends and I asked our taxi driver to go through the drive thru window here because I wanted to check out what all of the fuss over this place was about. I got the Double Double Animal style w/ fries and a lemonade to drink. I enjoyed the burger, but felt it tasted almost exactly like a Big Mac from McDonalds (maybe a little fresher). The fries weren't seasons very well, if at all. While I enjoyed the food, I just didn't feel it was anything worth mentioning, and certainly not worth driving a distance away for.   For all my friends on the West Coast always telling me how great this place is, I was anything but impressed. It wasn't too expensive for the burger, fries and a drink, but it also wasn't a bargain either. I'd much rather have a Five Guys burger and fries, than back here at In-N-Out Burger."}
{"text":"I've so missed this place!!   The staff were so nice. Burgers were just how I remember them!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to grab a quick lunch....Nice and spacious dine in area with plenty of outdoor seatings. They offer delicious burgers/fries for the great price. And besides being packed on a weekday, the service was surprisingly very fast! You have to try their yummy chocolate shake as well!!"}
{"text":"There is nothing better then an in and out burger. I had to stop here while on my trip to Vegas. Double with animal style fries. I could have had 3 of them, that's how good it was!"}
{"text":"In-n-Out Burger is definitely a cut above the rest. However, last time I visited Desert Ridge, I was so impressed with how kind and attentive an associate, Courtney was. She was so concerned with our experience being phenomenal, and it's evident they hire the greatest associates. The food, as per usual, was the most delicious burger I've had at a fast food joint. Thanks so much to the fine employees at Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"For fast food, it is up on the list.  It is one of the better ones out there, and the menu is simple.  This makes the service very quick even when it is busy.  However, after having 5 guys, I would give them the nod over In n' Out.     If, however, you have never been there and you are not living in an area that has one, it is work a visit.   Just don't compare it to a place that serves fine burgers...compare it to other fast food joints."}
{"text":"Tip: from the strip head onward towards the high roller Ferris wheel it's on the right side by the dancing water fountain.  Great burger, crispy toasty perfect bun, meat was thin but yummy seasoning.  Small menu which is great for the indecisive folks.  Service was friendly (as it's known for) and Christian owned! Thumbs up up up."}
{"text":"In N Out hasn't failed me yet!  The old faithful.  A group of six famished people walked in, waited 5 minutes to order, another 15 minutes to get their food, and all was well...  The burgers were tasty and cooked to perfection.  The fries were served as we requested - well done, regular, and light.  We devoured our meal in less than 30 minutes, with all the ruckus you expect to find in the restaurant, especially with it being the closest In N Out on Vegas' Strip...    Is it any wonder that we had order number 64 and by the time we left they cycled through and we walked out when order 77 was being called...  Over a hundred customers in less than an hour.  In-N-Out rocks my socks!!!"}
{"text":"We grabbed lunch on our way out of town and weren't disappointed to say the least! We both ordered a double \"animal style\"  and it came out the way I remembered it! Everything was hot and more importantly FRESH! Service was excellent too!"}
{"text":"Good burgers, super quick, don't order the fries they taste like dehydrated potatoes, the place is a little bit crazy, don't know if I'll ever go back, I rather go to a new place..."}
{"text":"Awesome place as most In-N-Out Burger locations are. When you first walk in a staffer will greet you with a level of friendliness that will catch you off guard in a fast food joint.  Food usually gets prepped and delivered to the counter fast. All the while someone is working in plain view magically making fresh fries out of bushels of potatoes. No frozen fries here!   I get a hamburger and fries. But, I don't like ketchup so I usually use BBQ sauce. But, none here. However, they are generous with mustard and pepper which is one of my alternatives to ketchup.  You'll usually encounter staffers roaming around keeping the place clean and making sure you're visit is enjoyable. That's a huge plus for me.  Seriously, it's just a burger. But it's gotta be the best value in fast food."}
{"text":"This location never messes up my order and they are happy to accommodate to the secret menu. Yes they are ALWAYS busy, but that should say something about them. If they piss me off I will give them less stars, but they have yet to do anything wrong. On that note I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"I have no idea what all the hype is over this place.  The burgers are definitely better than say...Mcdonalds but nothing spectacular. With all of the burger joints on the East coast, we can go without.  Now to all who would take offense to me saying this, I will say that I've realized they have an extensive\"special\" menu and just maybe things are better as I found with ordering the \"animal fries\". The fries would have been COMPLETE TRASH if it was nor for the sauce. Put that on some Burger King fries,,, better yet...any fast food chain and they would be great.  O.K. I'll give it to all the in-n-out hypsters that it does taste clean. As far as up there on the burger chart......keep it on the West coast for all we care.  I give em a star for giving the paper mats for eating in the car. Not sure as to why they would ask if we ere intending to eat in the car or elswhere if we are in the drivethrough but I'llleave it to beig in Vegas."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite burger joints! They do one thing, and they do it well! A very simple menu of just burgers, fries, shakes, & soda......period!  I remember the very first time I ever walked into an In-N-Out............ordered me a hamburger, ate it............then thought..........\"is that it?\" I was wondering what's the big deal?  It wasn't until one of my friends, who is an In-N-Out fanatic told me - \"NO\"..........anytime you go to an In-N-Out, you must always order the Double Double!!!  Since that time...............whenever I'm on the mainland, and walk into a In-N-Out burger joint, I always order a Double Double!   What can I say about the In-N-Out burger joint............  1. I wished they would open one up in Hawaii.  2. Food is cheap, only $3.20 for a Double Double, & very tasty too! Burgers are made to order on the spot, hot & fresh..........not like some other joints where they are microwaved & put under the heat lamp.   3. A very simple menu. They just do burgers, fries, shakes, & soda..........keepin' it simple, & they do it well!  4. Restaurant is very clean, and the service is EXCELLENT!  5. Open fountain kept very clean...........McDonald's could learn a thing or to (hint: McCully McDonalds!).  Lots of free parking..........but the place is always crowded on matter what time you go there.........Ka CHING!  I also heard from a friend to order the Double Double \"Animal Style\"...........don't know what this is...........I'll have to try it one day."}
{"text":"Eating at in n out is a must do every time we happen to be on the west coast. I sent my friends snapchats of my food and they were jealous. I think this is my favorite fast food burger ever. My husband and I both get the double doubles and fries. The burgers are fresh and I love the toasted roll. The fries are crispy and fresh as well. I think I got the burger animal style when we went years ago, but I don't think we remembered to order it that way this time. I wish they would put it as an option on the menu, rather than \"secret\". Now I need to come back to the West Coast soon to try it again.   I really liked this location as well. It was a short walk from our hotel and the Linc is a cool hangout place with a lot of different restaurants and bars. We were planning on coming back a second time later in the week but unfortunately we didn't make it back.  They need to open up some locations around Philly! Or at least somewhere along the East Coast!"}
{"text":"It's my second time at an In n Out Burger joint. I still think the food is only okay. I much prefer my Romer's Burger back home. It's really cheap though. I'll give you that. $6.76usd (tax included) for a cheeseburger , fries and a chocolate milkshake. Cheap :)"}
{"text":"My favorite burgers by far. Good simple burgers no more, no less. And more is not needed. My favorite is a classic hamburger with an extra toasted buns with fresh onions. You can get grilled onions, protein style (no buns), animal style, and many other different styles but for me, a classic burger is perfect. The fries are fresh cut and cooked to perfection. You can get them well done or light well too! If you want something a little more meaty you can go for a double double, 3 x 3, or 4 x 4. Any way you go, you won't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"We tried it just because we do not have one in New Orleans, we didnt see all the rave behind it. Just a burger and fries it didnt have any special taste. The special sauce fries were not great. It taste exactly like McDonald's Big Mac Sauce poured over fries, they were horrible. Will never return to an In/Out Burger ever again."}
{"text":"Just had to try it, after having seen various locations with vehicles wrapped around the parking lot & out into the street.    I thought it was very tasty.  & Since I have owned & operated restaurants, I especially liked watching their modus operanda & dissecting it to see what makes it tick.  The Formula works.  How the team turned out 70 fresh accurate orders in 25 minutes is a mystery to me.  Kudos to their unique system.  It's obviously a tightly-run ship.    I conversed with the Manager, who was minding the Merchandise Store.  California, 1948 . . . This is the only store that is not freestanding.    As the chain grew, in order to ensure high quality & consistency, the Owners resisted franchising or going public.  Textbook success.    The chain is currently owned by the only Granddaughter of the Founders, who will continue to open new stores, but has no plans to franchise or sell."}
{"text":"I came to the in-n-out location with a group of 10 people. Although it was extremely crowded inside, our group was quickly able to secure a cluster of tables and one of the workers was really quick about coming over to clean the tables so we could eat our food.  We waited in a long line, but it only took about five minutes for us to get to the front. The price for the quality of the burger is amazing! We got the double-double burgers with \"animal-style\" fries and it was absolutely delicious. This burger chain seriously needs to go to the east coast!!!"}
{"text":"This location was pretty quick which is always a challenge for In-N-Out.  They did their animal style well, but their burgers were a little dry and just don't do it for me.  For a chain, it is better than many other places but I definitely would not go out of my way to eat here.  The quality is only marginally better and usually it is anything but \"fast\" food.  I realize this is heresy to native Californians but since I'm not one, oh well :-)"}
{"text":"fries came old.  burger wasn't that good.  and the shakes were half filled and no taste (vanilla and chocolate).  pass."}
{"text":"In-N-Out has never let me down, whether I've had it in LA or  AZ. I'm especially fond of this location because it's never that busy when I go and the service is, as always, fast and friendly. I usually get a double double, animal fries and a Neapolitan shake. I've yet to attempt a crazy secret menu order, but I have a feeling they would be more than happy to fullfil it here."}
{"text":"I've been to In-N-Outs in Utah and this place is no different! Just amazing, fresh burgers that spot in your belly where you reach optimum contentment!  Everyone asks me back in Florida, why is In-N-Out so good?! The best way I can describe is; it's like some one took the best attributes from every burger ever and put it into one burger!!! Fresh pressed all beef patties that are pressed on a skillet; fresh crisp lettuce, a juicy tomato cut into a perfect slice, the bun is like that of a McDonalds cheeseburger only it's made fresh from scratch and perfectly toasted on the inside, and then the spread.... OH GAWD!!! The spread is this delicious cheesy, oniony, magical sauce!!!   ALSO: order it animal style!!! I can't tell what it is, but you'll want it!!!!"}
{"text":"As someone from the East coast I was so hyped to eat here. Ordered the regular cheeseburger, fries and a chocolate milkshake. The burger was good, fries were \"eh\" and the milkshake was amazing! Definitely not anything overly spectacular about In-N-Out, but if you're from out of state and you are thinking about trying it for the hype, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Coming from the East Coast, In-N-Out is highly regarded. So of course, while I was on the West Coast, I had to try it. I highly highly recommend the extra upgrade for animal style on your burger or fries. It sounds nasty but trust me, it will change your life. I personally prefer it on burgers but it's so good, it works on either. I am a little disappointed with their lack of food selections, but at least their selections are cheap!  Definitely a must try if you're in the West Coast!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here, there's a huge line.  And everytime I come here, I get scared because I want some InOut but I'm afraid the line's too long.  But... it's pretty efficient.  It's just as good as any other innout.  If people are complaining about the patties being thing or whatever -- they're crazy.  It's a fast food place, you can't compare it to say Burger Bar...  In n out, believe the hype."}
{"text":"In and Out burger on Sunset is your typical In and Out. My only issue with this location is getting into it....easy if you are driving east but if coming from the 95 you have to turn left on Marks then another left on a busy street. Drive thru line is short. I witnessed close to 2 accidents because people waiting for drive thru block driveways and its a mess.  The burgers are good, the workers are friendly. This location is very busy all the time. I think the closest location to Sunset is near UNLV. I don't even attempt going here from 4pm-8pm."}
{"text":"In-N-Out is always amazing. Their service is good, they have fresh fries and burgers, and there's not much else to say. ANIMAL STYLE EVERYTHING. Always."}
{"text":"Ahhh In N Out burger, how I think of you often and with such fond affection. I remember the first time we met, in Los Angeles, way back in 1987. I fell in love with your double patties, and double cheese as it sensually dripped from your hot fresh toasted buns. We broke up after I moved back to Oregon, but I would dream of you, and when I came back you were my first stop to satisfy my needs.  Fast forward to 2015. Over the years I have continued to visit you off and on and it has always been good. Even though my cravings for your sweet delights have grown less, I always think of you and visit when possible.  This location, off the 95 and Lake Mead...is always busy. I mean the street going into the parking lot is packed full of waiting cars. Doesn't seem to matter when, what time of day or night. Expect to wait a good 25 minutes. If I could make something happen, it would be to remove the auto parts or whatever store is there along with the Arby's so there would be ease in parking and waiting. The amount of times I've stopped by only to venture elsewhere due to the wait and lines has been numerous. In N Out, you have become a popular and naughty girl.   This burger on this occasion (pre-Oscar night at 5pm), wasn't up to your usual standards. If felt forced, almost mechanical. Your sweet juices didn't flow into my mouth. Perhaps you are becoming too busy, and your quality isn't up to normal. I still love you, but I might have to date others."}
{"text":"I'm from NY so perhaps my love from this place is simply a matter of supply and demand but I LOVE this place. I don't know how a bunch of slop with onions and cheese (animal style y'all!) can taste so good. I don't know what they do to the cow to turn it into the perfect burger (is it Jesus's cow?) but this food is godly. If you are from the East coast like me and are near IN-N-Out for vacation....eat here everyday. Eat here multiple times a day; lunch and dinner...in fact, order two burgers for lunch and heat that ish up for breakfast because it is THAT good."}
{"text":"Service: The staff is very friendly and consistent, always reading my orders back to assure its accurate.   Food: It is always fresh, hot and made to order. In comparison to a location I frequent this one makes a little more of a \"thrown together\" burger.. Not nearly as presentable as I am use to seeing  Cleanliness: The store appears to have a dedicated lobby attendant whenever I dine in, and keeps the place looking clean and inviting.  Overall, I would recommend this location."}
{"text":"I have been a regular here since its opening in 2007.  Service: The staff is very friendly and consistent, always reading my orders back to assure its accurate.   Food: It is always fresh, hot and made to order. I just love the hidden menu stuff!  Cleanliness: The store appears to have a dedicated lobby attendant whenever I dine in, and keeps the place looking clean and inviting.  Overall, I would highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"This is my second choice for In-n-Out just purely based on location..  The food is always fresh to order and accurate.  My only thought for improvement would be the parking lot. The bottom line is there is not enough and the configuration isn't friendly to dine in, and more designed for the drive thru..  I will still frequent the drive thru at this location. But will stay away from dinning in.."}
{"text":"Very good!  Especially the shakes and fries!  Burgers are good too and love how they make it to order but only one problem which is really not a problem is they are always so busy!!!! Yummy for the Tummy!"}
{"text":"Every time we are in the area for vacation (from Chicago) we ALWAYS make the trip here to get our fill! Coming from Chicago where Portillos is the best comparison, this place is a close second. I always get the double double, with a side of fries and a chocolate shake. VERY clean inside, can view the kitchen, and service is very friendly."}
{"text":"Who doesnt like this place, seriously.  Cheap and delicious burgers, the best bang for the buck hands down.  Animal fries? Yes please.  Chocolate shake? Yes pleaseee!  I try to come here whenever i have the late night munchies, but not toooooo often.  Great looking burgers, great prices, friendly staff.  WHat more could u ask for in a fast food chain"}
{"text":"Best burgers for under $5.  This is a westcoast establishment so if you're a tourist or just visiting the west coast this is a great place to grab a quick bite.  Everything is fresh and staff are always friendly.  My favorite burger chain hands down."}
{"text":"Came here the other night at 1 am, drive thru was quick and the food was still fresh! Definitely the place to go late night for a good burger! Animal style is the way to go!!!"}
{"text":"Oh In-N-Out Burger, how you intrigue everyone with your secret menu and ability to make anything \"Animal Style\". (Actually, does this apply to milkshakes too?)  Just because it's the thing to do when you make it to the west coast, we once again made our way here. First off, kudos to the staff here - they work their way through the mass orders like it's nothing. Secondly, one super nice employee tipped us on the barely used second set of rest rooms just across the street at their retail store. In-N-Out Burger scores high on my list just for those two points alone.  But on to the food, personally I think their fries are hit or miss. (Please don't hate.) Unfortunately, they lacked crunch this time around and I found myself going through ketchup like there's no tomorrow. The burger was decent; you could tell it was freshly made and had a good amount of veggies on it. Really, you can't go wrong - it may not be the best burger you'll ever have but it always hits the spot."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with in&out burger and this one is open late for those late night cravings!!   Clean, very busy when we were here but you still got your food very quickly! Fresh burgers and fries- great prices.   If you've never been to one of these places definitely check it out!   As far as fast food goes this places isn't junk...fries are peeled and diced daily from potatoes, cooked in cholesterol free oil, no preservatives in buns and buyers are made from fresh beef that's never frozen!   Staff is friendly and place is clean :)"}
{"text":"Busy busy as usual. This location is in the heart of the strip. There's a line always but it goes quick!   The food is very fresh and the staff is extremely happy and kind it's actually very noticeable. Staff is also always cleaning the tables and floors nonstop. Very impressive!"}
{"text":"West coast vibes ! oh how excited i am to eat here when i'm on this side of the states. My cab driver stopped through the drive through which was super fast!   The food was amazing and fresh as usual. 5 stars!! We even got hats!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience , I don't recommend you use their drive thru service as i waited , over 20 min. Had 2 different lines and the employee was only taking orders from 1 line. Get a little more organized.  I won't be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Whew they were incredibly busy for a Monday night! But in n out burger is usually pretty packed.. And I love their burgers so it's worth the wait! The restaurant is pretty clean considering how busy they are. I like sitting and watching the employees work cause they're usually always hustling and moving it.   The girl at the front counter told me she'd have my total at the window lol thought she was on drive thru.. Made me laugh..  I think I've had one bad experience out of one hundred so I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm from Ohio so whenever I come to the west coast I have to get In-N-Out! The simple menu is great so you don't have to sit there and try to make decisions. I love getting the animal fries, they're to die for! One of the best locations I've been to. Staff was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I'm always amazed at how happy employees working here seem. Its usually young kids and the management must be doing something right. Food is always consistent and never disappoints in satisfying the burger craving. Try the animal fries. Try it once and you never look back!"}
{"text":"I'm not gonna state what isn't obvious so I'll keep it short.   In-N-Out isn't a place for gourmet burgers or a life changing experience. It's a model of how good fast food should be.  Burgers are grilled in store. Employees are paid decently so they're generally friendly. Fries are cut from potatoes on site. To top it off it's an open kitchen design you can see how your food is being prepared!  The reason people rave about In-N-Out is because the chain manages to do things the right way and stay profitable. The burgers and fries taste good not because of some magical ingredient but simply because they were prepared and cooked fresh on site."}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii, we don't have an In-N-Out Burger there, so it's a treat to have lunch/dinner here when visiting Vegas. The staff here is very friendly and know the meaning of customer service. I've never seen an employee not happy or friendly. The food is served freshly made with the appropriate temperature for the food. The only thing is that it gets rather crowded depending on the time of the day. But this is good as you know they're good and that items will always be fresh. Orders here are accurate and correct. I have yet to have an order that is wrong.   The fries are delicious as well as the burgers. I noticed that the fries are not as oily as other restaurants, and this is a good thing.   All in all, this location (next to UNLV) is great. I hope to visit other locations in Las Vegas as well."}
{"text":"This In-N-Out is BUSY! Of course, what In-N-Out isn't? Anytime of the day or night, you'll be sure to see a steady stream of people making their way here. And why? It's probably because this location is the closest from the strip. You'll see a ton of tourists here with suitcases as well as taxi cabs waiting in the parking lot.   +Ample parking, large parking lot +Orders are taking accurately +Food is received fresh and fast +If there is a line, the line moves fast due to to the fast order taking  However, if it's a line that scares you, this is probably a location to avoid because it's so crowded."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  The shake was good and the burger average... but these were some of the WORST fries I have ever had.  I remember visiting an In-N-Out Burger in San Diego years ago and it being great, so I'm not sure if I've just grown out of it, if the food has changed in the last 5 years, or if this was just a bad one."}
{"text":"The secret of their Success? Smile + Fresh Food + Consistency = SUCCESS  Atmosphere 4/5: I love the retro look that In-N-Out has and they kept it that way for so many years. It's really a great business strategy.  Food 4/5: Can't give a 5-stars to a fast food... But this is THE burger I would eat in a world of only fast food joint. Nothing is frozen at In-N-Out. This is one of the reasons that they haven't expended too much because of the location of their distribution centers. Service 4/5: Always great and friendly service. Consistent to their customers and I like it.  Make sure to try their Secret Menu... Animal Style Fries or if let me know if U dare having a 4x4 Protein Wrap Animal Style (No bun). One last thing that I love about this location is that it's less crowded than the other locations located on the Strip or close by. Also, don't be a lazy dog and go inside get your order instead of doing the drive-in, you'll get it MUCH FASTER than the cars waiting in the line."}
{"text":"I've been a consistent costumer of In N Out throughout the years. They make the best hamburgers EVER. Seriously, I feel like angels are dancing on my tongue after ever bite. I'm almost positive I saw a unicorn poop out a rainbow last time I was here. The food is always delicious, hot and fresh. This location was no different. Only downside to my last visit is that some rando crazy man walked in talking to himself and hung out in the corner for awhile having a very important  and loud conversation with himself. I wasn't really fazed. I mean shit it's 105 outside, that'll make the best of us go a little crazy. Now get up and go get yourself a damn double double and don't forget to animal style that ish."}
{"text":"Coming from Florida I had heard a lot about in and out burger so I knew I couldn't pass up a chance to finally try it. I'm not going to lie it had been talked up so much and I was definitely disappointed. It was by no means a bad burger but I definitely did not think it was anything special. I also got the animal fries and I think it's one of those things you either love or hate. I definitely didn't enjoy the sauce so I would recommend seeing if you can get it on the side of you want to try. Overall it was a good cheap meal but not something I would recommend going out of your way for."}
{"text":"Animal style , animal style , animal style ! When I first came here I knew nothing about the \"secret menu \" .... Boy how adding animal style to fries and burgers makes such a difference ! I will be back."}
{"text":"This location is by far one of the busiest I have ever been to. I think everyone needs the magic of in n out to recover from a crazy night in Vegas. Parking is difficult but manageable and the staff was so so friendly. I have never had a bad experience at in n out and this one was just as good as the rest...even with the line that wrapped around the inside like a conga line.  It's the perfect prescription for the post-debauchery hangover of a Vegas night."}
{"text":"We've never eaten at a In-N-Out before and really wanted to stop in here to see what all of the hype was about.  People crave these things and rant about how good they are.    Our Five Star rating is only for comparing it to other Fast Food joints.  We really think the price, food, and professional employees destroy most of their competition.  We really appreciate that their menu is so simple and sticks to what they do best; burgers and fries.  No gimmicks or silly combos offered in an attempt to confuse their customers.  Also, we appreciate how fresh all of the ingredients are and how everything is prepared to-order.  Finally, vary rarely do you see happy employees at most Fast Food establishments.  The workers here are great.  If this branch is a standard of the chain, then they've done an amazing job with the franchise.  Compliments aside, we don't really get the hype.  Yeah, it's good food, but it's still Fast Food.  We enjoyed our meal, but we'd never crave an In-N-Out.  Our cravings are reserved for another place that serves sliders that we eat by the case or sackful."}
{"text":"This is how I like my In-N-Out Burger: 3x2, 3 patties and 2 cheese with grilled onions, well done buns and a side of fresh cut fries that's well, well done.  Granted I came during EDC weekend so the lines were almost out the door, I was impressed with their speed at serving the 50 orders that were in front of me. I've been told this location is \"the best\" on the west coast. I can't comment much on that statement since I've only been to the one in Dallas. I'd say they're about the same in taste - which was so yummy I went back the next day."}
{"text":"What restaurant chain can be such a success without using ketchup and mustard on a burger?!  In-N-Out has been my go to spot for late at night munchies in the valley...   It's pretty much as simple as it gets.. a 2 sided menu with large font shows you exactly what they do... burgers. fries. shakes.  My personal favorite is the protein style (secret menu, which is pretty extensive) burger that replaces the bun with a healthy wrapping of lettuce.... so I can eat my fries!  There's just something special about the simplicity... the burger patty is so small, yet perfect. The tomato is just as big as the patty (if not bigger) and perfect as well... and then the secret sauce just brings everything together to make a burger that is wonderful and something that the West Coast will always claim as its own:]"}
{"text":"Slowest in n out ever. Took 20 minutes to get my order. 2 cheeseburgers fries and a shake.  Send somebody outside to take orders in the drive thru. 10pm and theirs 10 cars in line. And 20 people inside . Step it up"}
{"text":"a quick way to have a burger . yummy, fresh and easy! fresh potato fries and hamburger and milk shakes. you can't go wrong with a simple menu"}
{"text":"Finally got to have a burger here after years of people bragging... Oh man it was good, but... If you have ever been to Dick's in Seattle, then you will know that In & out burger is no match. Dick's is still my favorite and if you have been to Seattle and never had Dick's then you haven't had a real burger!"}
{"text":"This place was fast. We came in because the drive through line was pretty long. It was still pretty busy but after we got our order in, there were only 10 orders in front of ours.   We ordered 6 burgers and fries; we were in and out (to go) in less than 10 minutes. Good was on point. Cooked to quality and not s single error."}
{"text":"\"I always say, 'Eat clean to stay fit; have a burger to stay sane.'\" ? Gigi Hadid  Yas, Gigi.  Yaaas!  I don't know a single person that doesn't like In-N-Out.  They're affordable, delicious, and also comes out hot and steamy.  Sure, their fries are junky but I just go to In-N-Out for their cheeseburgers anyways.  As Chrissy Teigen once stated in an interview, \"The In-N-Out burger over any other burger, but I will take McDonald's fries.\"  Truth.  I will say that getting their fries Animal Style does help a little.  Get some extra Spread Sauce, a side of peppers, and enjoy! And that hot chocolate? Well it's Ghirardelli powdered cocoa mix and hot water. For $1-something, what more do you want?  Get your bougie cocoa elsewhere.   I like this location. They're fast, friendly, and it's a clean location despite how insanely busy it gets.  The drive-thru is never an issue either."}
{"text":"Just went through the drive thru and ordered 4 burgers. Once he read them back we corrected him on one of the burgers and we went to pay for our food. We get all the way home before realizing they gave us the complete wrong bag. And once we checked the receipt he had also not changed the order with the correction we made. No consideration for what we actually ordered. Once we got back they remade the food and gave us money back but still messed up one of our burgers."}
{"text":"If you're a burger and fries person, you will love it. It's fresh fast food with the kind of story that makes a visit ask the more fun.  If you get a a chance to run Google search on \"In and Out Burger fun facts\" and you'll learn that Julia Child was a fan, that every restaurant has crossed psalm trees outside, and that there are Bible verses on their packaging."}
{"text":"Always fresh and good. Usually fairly busy, but service is quick and friendly..."}
{"text":"Having an In-N-Out move in down the street from us was the worst thing ever... for our diets.  Whenever we drive past, our car somehow manages to drive itself into the drive-through line to pick up a cheap strawberry milkshake.  I've been asking my husband to take the car in and get it checked out to see if we can get this issue fixed (he said it's something related to the power steering?), but he hasn't done it yet.  Anyway, protein-style animal-style is the way to go.  I can't believe a restaurant still manages to operate in today's economy with such low prices while maintaining such high quality customer service.  It's like the Dutch Bros of hamburgers.  Actually, what I can't believe is that restaurants like McDonalds are still in business when In-N-Out exists.  I'm just going to sit back and wait for them to take over the world.  I'm sure it'll happen soon."}
{"text":"Best fast casual burger in the West. Friendly and wonderful staff. Clean restaurant. And always consistently good product!!!"}
{"text":"I personally love In N Out as well as my girlfriend. We love coming here right after work or before we head into work. It's been a few years since I've been inside, I'm usually on the go so the drive thru is perfect! Where In N Out is located its a pretty busy area, you have Chuckee Cheese to the 99 Cents store etc, right before jumping on the freeway!   The drive thru line can get very long and the wait time is not as bad as if you were in a McDonalds drive thru line. They have a rope and poles to direct cars so no one gets cut in front of or from other directions. The last couple times we've been here it's not too bad, and wait times are 5-7 mins, depending on how much the first car ordered.   Today though I have to state my first complaint. I ordered a hot chocolate. Now I've been reading the news and seeing them boast about how good the hot chocolate was with marshmallows...it was horrible. If you call watered down hot chocolate good then I guess you would love it. I was disappointed. I should've tried it then and there but I was on my way to work. I didn't even get the marshmallows.  Overall I love In N Out but they should be better when it comes to making sure things are to perfect quality aka hot cocoa...I get it comes out of a dispenser but it does tell you if the powder is getting low."}
{"text":"Hot food prepared like In and out should be. Nice personnel.  Extremely busy, employees are super fast but so busy it may take a bit"}
{"text":"Did I miss it, or has no one mentioned that Las Vegas can be proud that it was the birthplace of the 100x100 ( http://whatupwilly.blogspot.com/2006/01/in-n-out-100x100.html )?  OK, back to our regularly scheduled program.  Coming from the East Coast, I wasn't familiar with In 'N' Out Burger, but it was hard to ignore the paeans promulgated by its passionate proponents. Like others, I enjoyed the old time feel of the place, and the secret menu is both fun and useful. Armed with such terms as \"animal style\" and \"well done\", I was ready to do battle. My order? A double double, and French fries animal style.  I gotta tell ya, I was a little disappointed. Yes, it's a good burger. For a fast food chain, it's a very good burger...but a fast food burger nonetheless. More disappointing were the fries. I thought the fries themselves were soft and bland (I would return at a later date, and get my fries well done, but they were no better). Animal style was a definite improvement, but still not a sublime experience.  Was I expecting too much? Did the five minute trip to my room cause the fries to lose their edge? Am I a hamburger cretin? Maybe, but I think it's mostly that there's only so much you can do with a mass produced patty of ground beef.  Two stars."}
{"text":"Freshest, cheapest fast food meal.  The parking lot is a pain in the rear though, almost impossible to get parking on a weekend or evening."}
{"text":"Best Hamburger joint in the west. A very simple menu and best of all the service is wonderful."}
{"text":"Ah In-N-Out  Everytime I'm I visit the West Coast I have to visit In N Out no matter what. Just 2 weeks ago I was here and as always the staff is very polite and speedy.  I ordered off the secret menu a 3x3 with Fries Well Done Animal Style and it was great. was super full but WHO CARES WHEN YOURE ON VACATION!  Can never go wrong with In-n-Out. GO! Oh and heres a dope photo. yo ullll"}
{"text":"Great food and service, the sweet young lady that took my order suggested that I get the pink lemonade with sprite and I absolutely love it!!!!  I didn't get her name but shout out for that suggestion!!!  Everyone at the window was so nice and friendly.  Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Food is my biggest weakness. Sometimes I won't even be hungry but will be drawn to eating something because 1. I've never tried it before or 2. because I wont have the chance elsewhere and well this was the case for In-n-out last week in Vegas.  We had eaten breakfast at Egg and I that morning and I had stuffed my face with pancakes, bacon, and eggs so I was planning on a light dinner. I spent the rest of the morning driving around and buying foodie goodies at random places I had bookmarked (Popped and Bouchon Bakery) So there had been close to NO exercise being done.   When I got back to the hotel one of the first things my sister suggested we  do is go to in-n-out....She had just woken up from a 4 hour nap and she wants fast food? I was close to saying Sorry, no. But wait it's your 2nd to last day and you already decided your bringing Earls on the plane you won't have another chance said a devil voice in my head. Okay I said, let's go.  As we walked into In-N-Out  I was instantly transported back in time. The decor, the uniforms, the basic menu were all so 50's. I was a little surprised to see how simple the menu was but better for me, less decisions to make. Although I probably would have just stuck to fries at any other fast food place else my inner devil foodie demanded I try a burger so I went with the combo 1, a cheeseburger and fries.   My sister ordered before and got the infamous animal fries which I thought were only lathered with their special sauce...WRONG. They had melted cheese, the special sauce and grilled onions. Heartattack on the spot. :-)   Honestly I wish I had gone a little hungrier because although I was able to eat half my burger and 1/4 of the fries I didn't get to enjoy it as much as I may have after a night of drinking or on an empty stomach....Regardless, it was fresh fresh fresh for fast food and I was happy to see a guy making the fries from potatoes in the back..  I think next time I'll stick to an animal burger and regular fries..  I also have never seen such hard workers at a fast food joint, which definitely earns a star in my book!   YELP 365: 162/365"}
{"text":"This is a super speedy In-N-Out! However, it's super crowded because this a popular hotspot for tourists who want a taste of California without having to make the extra drive.  I think that they could build more ways to get the food and make this super huge of a location. They could probably build two buildings for this location and double the drive thru."}
{"text":"My husband is from California. We just landed and both of us were on the hangry stage. So when we got to Vegas we went straight to the Linq area. For him to get his favorite animal style burger and fries.  This is a chain and it was exactly what my husband wanted."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. I have to say I avoid this place like the plaque. It is the worst layout for  a drive thru  it definitely was not put in the best spot, The line gets real long and it makes the parking lot hard to use.  I think Mainly because this is close to the strip and it gets A LOT of tourists! It is not a place for locals to go because of how busy it gets. Takes a while to get a order placed. The food is good has always here. This is the first place I tried Animal Style on my burger and fries. So good!!! Service is pretty good as well. Just the drive through is real bad and how busy this place gets.   If your staying on the strip and have never been here before you do want to make this your stop and get some Fresh food! Hamburgers and fries are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"We have stopped here a lot over the years. Its one of those good stand by places that are really always so fresh and consistent with their food. The Double Double is great,,,, Sometimes we get animal style. This location can get pretty busy in the drive thru but it goes pretty fast, We highly recommend this location it has always been so yummy!!! ***** All the way!!!!"}
{"text":"A must stop for anyone on the north end of the strip if your on vacation you have to try In N out burger! They are so good and so worth trying out if you have never been here! (If your saying what about the south end of the strip there is another down your way off Tropicana, it is always packed! This one is not far from Palace Station) There is also a secret menu (Animal Style) it is not on the board make sure to ask for this you can have on your burger and fries!  We have been to this location many times and have always had good food. The drive through is pretty fast, everything is always so fresh tasting. You can see through the window they are cutting fresh fries they are not frozen! For a fast food restaurant they are VERY good and always consistent!"}
{"text":"Okay -- I get it. In-N-Out, you boast a great burger. Tried the double double with everything on it and was not disappointed. You can taste the freshness, which in the fast food world seems to oft be overlooked. Not here though!  The simplicity of the menu is nice too - basically just figure out how hungry you are and go from there. Not so hungry, get a single. Ready for a full meal? Get a double double with fries and maybe a shake.   Minus one star at this location for the homeless folks that sit inside and take food off of your tray... Management should probably be on the look out for folks that are not paying customers. I wasn't even done with my meal (albeit, I was slowing down and conversation a bit more) when a man came and took my fries from my tray... I was so confused/awestruck that I didn't even say anything. Huge turn off."}
{"text":"How dare some lame group of people crown Five Guys over this place.  My order: 3x3 , no spread, no tomatoes, regular whole onion, lettuce, cheese, and chopped chilis. (I sometimes go protein style when I don't want bread.)  Having the burger dry (but still juicy) and with no tomatoes really lets you taste the crispness and quality in the meat.  The fries aren't amazing but they're not bad. Cheese fries are amazing. Animal style fries if you're game.  Their house lemonade is also in a league of its own."}
{"text":"Being from Maine, I knew I needed to try In-N-Out while on the West Coast. Wanted to see how it compares to Five Guys. Which honestly both restaurants have their positives. Service was fast for the amount of people there. The price was also reasonable (although heard it's a little more than an average location) as it's a strip location. I got the cheeseburger combo but should have gone with the double for a more filling burger. Great quality burger and fries though. While the fries tasted better here than five guys, I'd overall say five guys is better. More customization and larger burger and fry portions. It comes very close though and will easily eat here again anytime I'm back. A must stop place to eat for any coming to the West Coast who haven't experienced it before. Fast and tasty food at a reasonable price on the strip can't be beat."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries for affordable prices! I've tried other burgers but theirs are just awesome. Fries are fresh and never too oily. Best for drive thru for me!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just biased because we all know \"west coast best coast\" ;).  This place is the best, food and prices are drool worthy. Though the menu hasn't changed since it's opening do not be fooled by its simple demeanor. The food is super fresh and the staff is always nice and ready to go. There is something for everyone, minus vegans. Don't eat meat? No problem grab a grilled cheese. Can't eat bread? No problem, go protein style. Super hungry, try a 3x3! Or if you're feeling adventurous why go animal style!  Great food, service, and prices. Just remember, while they have a secret menu if someone tries to convince you that there's a doggie style-there isn't ;)"}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out, period the end. Keep in mind this location can get pretty busy around lunch because it's located in a business-centric location."}
{"text":"Very average. It was good, but I had higher expectations. I prefer steak and shake, Wendy's, etc....."}
{"text":"Good place for a great burger. Didn't have to wait this time it was late. Guy did a good job upwelling additional items. LOL"}
{"text":"Best parts of In-N-Out - burgers, pink lemonade, secret menu, animal-style anything, consistency, staff well-trained  Worst parts - always busy, fries, shakes kinda meh  Still, reminds me of my high school days, and the animal-style burger has the perfect salt/fat/acid/sweet/umami balance with the grilled onions - mmmmm!"}
{"text":"Don't hate me, but I wasn't blown away. To be fair, this is my first In-N-Out experience and I even animal styled both my cheeseburger and fries...but it still just wasn't worth all of the hype. Everything was cold and the fries that looked oh-so good really fell flat.I do realize that this is a fast food joint and that my review may come off a bit too harshly, but any place that has a cult following better deliver and In-N-Out did not."}
{"text":"This is by far the best burger joint in town for the prices they offer. We live right around the corner and grab dinner here often. I've never had a bad meal or experience and everyone who works there is so polite & prompt. The last time we went there was a mix up at the register where they gave me regular fries instead of animal. They immediately took care of it and I got my order quickly corrected without an issue. Establishment is always very clean too, considering how busy this place is I'm always impressed at how quickly they clean the tables so other people can sit. We will always be big fans of In-N-Out!"}
{"text":"These guys close the door in my face right at 11:30 heaven forbid these guys close one minute past there scheduled hours."}
{"text":"There is no In-N-Out Burger in central IL, where I live, so it was a must try when I was in Phoenix.  I was not disappointed.  My first reaction upon walking in was, \"wow, really simple\".  You order from a menu with about 3 or 4 options.  Do you want a burger, a cheeseburger, or doubles?  That's it.  That simple.  I wanted a burger and a milkshake, so that's what I got.  It was all fantastic.    If you know what you're good at, then just do that!  Was in, was out, and ate a burger.  Seems pretty simple.  I dig it."}
{"text":"My family and I love this burger joint! Its a wait sometimes but there's a reason, its good fresh food."}
{"text":"If you've ever read any of my reviews, you know that I'm not that bright. So it shouldn't surprise you that I embarked on a 4.5 hour hike up a desert mountain with minimal supplies and only a few grapes for food. Or that I got lost on the way down.   When I finally made my way back to civilization, I was what I like to call \"Angry Hungry,\" Or, \"hangry.\" Meaning, if I didn't eat anything soon I would have to hurt someone.*   And even though I had reservations at a lovely French bistro later that evening, I knew what I needed, right then and there: a Double-Double, Animal Style.   It was served with a genuine smile, which I rudely ignored in favor of immediately tearing into that burger like it had called me Stuart.** It was animalistic, indeed. And this thing was not only the best fast-food burger I'd ever tasted, but also a damn good deal at $3 and change.   I don't always eat fast food, but when I do, I prefer In-N-Out. __________  *Or more likely, weep uncontrollably until my mommy made me a snack. **I hate being called Stuart."}
{"text":"My first experience with an In-N-Out Burger has quite a story attached to it.  It was December 2001 and I was in Hollywood CA attending the first official Muppet fan convention.  Most of the fest had taken place at a center in Santa Monica but the grand finale was a live performance of The Muppet Show at The Hollywood Palace.  The group I was carpooling with to the theater said we HAD to stop for dinner at In-&-Out since it was practically a California legend and no trip to the area should take place without eating there.  (In-&-Out did open its first Arizona location a year prior though not this one and I hadn't yet eaten at any.)  It certainly was an incredibly enjoyable experience but what made it even more memorable was that when we later watched the show, the opening number was the classic Muppet routine \"Mahna Mahna\" - and in this version, Mahna Mahna left the stage near the end of the number as the huge video screens cut to (prerecorded) footage of Mahna Mahna stepping into a limo, cruising the area and pulling up to...the very same In-&-Out Burger!  Those of us who had just been there a couple hours before totally went wild and applauded like mad!  So of course when more In-N-Out's started opening in Phoenix and finally this particular locale nice and close to me, this was very exciting!  How could I not eat at one and instantly recall that wonderful memory from one of the happiest times of my life?  Indeed, it's a great place to visit and I've never had any kind of problems or issues there.  Still, all things considered it's not a place i visit more than once every few months even though i'm at that intersection often.  One of the main obstacles is that I'm a bus rider/pedestrian.  I'm often visiting shops on the SW corner - and ultimately that's where I would be catching my bus to go home.  Unfortunately there's no crosswalk connecting the SW and the NW corner of the intersection so you have to go around the long way to cross the street - crossing three different streets (and waiting on three different lights).  The hassle usually isn't worth it when there are so many other easily accessible dining areas available to me.  But still when I visit, the experience is a good one.  Unlike most burger places, there are just a few items on their entire menu - there's three combo meals, the difference between them being how the burger is prepared.  This helps people go \"in and out\" because they don't spend ages antagonizing over what they're going to order!  The burgers are excellent.  Yet I must admit while they're among the better tasting burgers out there, they're not my favorite - I actually prefer those from Hamburger Works and from Culver's...which is one of those other dining options on that SW corner of the intersection!  The fries are pretty disappointing.  Especially when you consider that this restaurant only has a few specific items they specialize in, you'd expect the things they do have to be much better.  They aren't awful but far from anything to write home about either...they rely on the ketchup to make them more digestible.  But I suppose part of the problem is that the restaurant has obtained such a legendary following that if there were to even slightly tamper with its existing recipes/preparation, too many of the Die-Hards would cry Blasphemy.  So for better or for worse I guess we're stuck with the blandness that is the In-N-Out french fries.  So aside from great burgers & shakes with a side of not-so-great fries, what else sets them apart?  Well, there's the fact that everything is made with all natural fresh ingredients.  They also retain a very classic nostalgic look in both the decor/design  of the restaurants and the look of the employees.  I know there's some locations where maintaining that aesthetic tends to make their hiring a little elitist in that they tend to favor young Caucasian males.  But on my most recent visit, there was a good mix of ages, gender, and ethnicity working there.  Everyone is super polite - and it's not just \"an act\" since they pay their employees very well compared to competitors so the people serving you are truly happy to be there.  One can almost feel like they're stepping through a time machine when they've entered their doors to a simpler, easier, more carefree time - until you're confronted with the reality of 2010's prices.  But still even though you're not gonna be paying a quarter for a burger the way you might be if you were truly back in time, the prices aren't too expensive or out of control either.  Another thing worthy of note.  In the seating area where you wait for your order, you have a clear view of the entire kitchen/food prep area.  It's clean and very well maintained.  Consistently!  So it may not be completely perfect or the most convenient option, it still is a generally pleasant experience when I visit.  Though part of me still secretly hopes that one of these days, I'll stop in and find Mahna Mahna there grabbing a bite!"}
{"text":"This was the first time at In-N-Out and I thought it was a good experience! The cashier seemed to rush us a little bit, which is probably normal because the restaurant's name implies speedy service. The venue was pretty clean and we received our food relatively quickly. I got a cheeseburger and animal style fries, both of which were excellent. The burger was not too greasy and all of the ingredients were very fresh. The fries were awesome, as expected -- cheese, thousand island sauce, and caramelized onion on perfectly crispy fries can do no wrong. I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Wow, I just ordered my food, I went to the restroom and I am amazed by how clean it is! I've never seen a fast food place this clean. This is my new in-n-out!"}
{"text":"I finally got to IN-N-Out Burger!!  The burgers were everything I expected them to be.  The shakes were outstanding.  The fries, blah.  You can do without those.  Yeah, they're fresh, but absolutely flavorless.  That said, the burgers ROCK!  Can't wait to go back."}

{"text":"Auf unserer Rundreise haben wir häufig die Restaurantkette In-n-Out Burger besucht, die mit dem Versprechen \"Quality You Can Taste\" wirbt. In Las Vegas , an der Sahara Avenue, sind wir eingekehrt, da die Filiale am Strip total überlaufen ist. Im Internet konnte ich nachlesen, dass es das Unternehmen bereits seit 1948 gibt und es mittlerweile ca. 300 Restaurants im Westen der USA und Texas gibt.  Am späten Abend war hier der Andrang nur mittelmäßig. Die Auswahl war einfach, da es nur drei verschiedene Burger und Pommes zur Auswahl gibt. Wenn man es dann zur Bestellung geschafft hat, bekommt man eine Nummer, die dann aufgerufen wird sobald die Bestellung fertig ist.  Auf die Burger kommt nur gekühltes und kein gefrorenes Frischfleisch, das von der eigenen Fleischfabrik innerhalb von 24 Stunden geliefert wird. Die Kartoffeln für die Pommes werden im Restaurant aus frischen Kartoffeln hergestellt. Ich konnte es selber in der offenen Küche sehen, wie ein Mitarbeiter die Kartoffeln geschält und gewürfelt hat.  Preislich bewegt man sich trotzdem weit unten, da man auf eine umfangreiche Auswahl verzichtet. Wenn man mit mehreren Leuten hier einkehrt, sollten die anderen ein Plätzchen im Restaurant sichern, da diese zu den Stoßzeiten ebenfalls rar sind.  Vor den meisten Läden findet man zwei gepflanzte Palmen, die gekreuzt wachsen und eine Anspielung auf den Lieblingsfilm des Inhabers \"Eine total, total verrückte Welt\" sein sollen. Eine weitere Marotte sind angedruckte Bibelstellen auf den Unterseiten der Getränkebecher.  Von der Qualität des Essens und dem Preis- Leistungsverhältnis waren wir wirklich begeistert. Unser Lieblingsrestaurant während unserer Rundreise."}

{"text":"Get outta here shake shack...   Even as a California native in Vegas, I still had to get a double double with whole grilled onions, with a side of light well done fries. This location was a little bit pricier than at the regular CA chains, but nowhere near what you'd pay at that God forbidden shake shack.   It was really interesting to see tourists from all over the country and the world try In n Out for the first time. You could tell from their expressions and how empty their tables were that they enjoyed this California staple.   Just FYI: There are no restrooms located inside this establishment."}
{"text":"This was my very first time having In-N-Out Burger. Everything was going great until I ate one fry that had something red on it not thinking anything of it. When I tasted it I realized it was someone else's BLOOD. This has scarred me and was a huge disappointment for my first time. Burger was good but not as great as east coast competitors;)"}
{"text":"Pulled in here at 11:30pm on a Friday night. Outside was the biggest in-n-out burger sign I've ever seen. Only in Vegas! It was pretty packed inside. Got my usual double-double and fries. Delicious as always.  There were some people buzzed and faded. Always interesting to people watch in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out!!! This location is awesome. The staff is extremely friendly. It can get busy, so I would recommend going durning the off times."}
{"text":"Let's face it! Most every burger aficionado inhabiting California and Nevada now knows what to expect from an In-N-Out Burger: not a fancy gourmet burger but a great-tasting burger nevertheless, with astoundingly fresh ingredients, including a generous slice of ripe red tomato, crunchy green lettuce, and either a lovely cold and thick slice of White Onion or warm grilled onion ribbons, together with a foundation of nice and creamy Thousand Island Dressing slathered over the base of a soft and supple hamburger bun.  Whether a Double-Double, a Cheeseburger, or a Hamburger, the model is pretty much the same, and each variety of burger is surely enhanced by an order of freshly cut skin-on French Fries.  Liberally add readily available tomato ketchup to both burger and fries, and a memorable dining experience will be close at hand.   That's the way it was the other night when I enjoyed the trifecta of Cheeseburger, Hamburger, and an open-faced paper tray filled with freshly made fries.  Seats were hard.  But who cared?  Associates were very pleasant and accommodating.  My burgers were prepared close to medium rare as sought, and when ready, the food was even brought to our booth.  But inexplicably, although I tendered a ten dollar bill and a five dollar bill to pay the total of $13.78, the receipt received listed cash tendered as $14.97, and change returned as $1.19 instead of the correct amount of $1.22.  Except for the unnecessary loss of a few extra pennies, another fine In-N-Out dining experience!"}
{"text":"It's In-N-Out, so of course the food was delicious! Come on, I've never been to a location and had bad food. This location is quicker and the wait was shorter than to one on Tropicana & Dean Martin. Thank god I'm by this location now! Animal style fries is always the way to go!!!"}
{"text":"Everytime we come out to Vegas, we always, always visit this burger joint! For the cheap prices, the food here is soo freakin awesome! I always get a cheeseburger and the fresh cut fries are soo yummy!!! The wait is worth the food!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and today was the day I was just fed up. The girls at the drive-through were rude I try to order food and when she took my order she said that I needed the girl to repeat my order because she got it wrong she repeated my order but apparently when I got my ticket when I paid it didn't say the right order and when I got my food everything was just thrown into the bag. There was fries were everywhere and my hamburger was all messed up, this was the worst experience at in and out I have ever had in my life I will never go here again."}
{"text":"Delish burger!  In-n-Out Burger totally lived up to the hype I've heard--the hype of friends and relatives I've been hearing for years! Everything was fresh: burger, flaky bun, fixings. The store was immaculate and the staff helpful and welcoming. I wish this chain would set up shop on the east coast."}
{"text":"I get a double double every time I go to the West.  I highly recommend it with grilled onions!"}
{"text":"Good burger for the price, especially if you get it animal style.  Still though, they don't have bacon.  NO BACON!!  That would be like the equivalent of opening up a pizza joint but having no pepperoni.  Shame."}
{"text":"I ordered a 3X3 protein style burger and asked for it to be double wrapped and let them know that I'll be eating it in the car. When I got my order they handed it to me in a bad so I had to ask for a box and setup my burger so I could eat it while driving back to LA.   When I saw my burger it was a huge fail, they barely wrapped it once with two small pieces of lettuce so I was pretty much grabbing cheese as that's all that was seeping out.   So instead of eating it while I drive as I normally do I had to pull over and park to eat this sloppy burger."}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed let me tell you... I have never sat in an in-and-out Burger line and was out in less than 15 minutes.  I was blown away keep up the good work guys are do an amazing."}
{"text":"We love \"In and Out\" burgers & fries. Great milkshakes too.  When we want a quick burger, this is the place for it!   You can see the fries are made right there before they are cooked so you know they haven't been sitting around half the day.   Simple menu, just a few choices, and delicious! Always a good choice for a quick meal on the go."}

I just noticed I did not have an active review for this particular In-N-Out Burger so here goes easy and simple!  This is a staple burger joint that I have eaten at since my days living in los angeles, (SFV) and the quality never disappoints! My boyfriend and I go here from time to time to get our burger and animal style fries craving satisfied! Animal style is the way to go on the fries for sure because they are just too plain and dry without the caramelized onions and special sauce. !  The Fantastic service, cleanliness and quality can't be beat!  We love In-N-Out Burger!"}
{"text":"What can I say that has not already been said about In-N-Out Burger? The service, cleanliness and food quality is top notch!  I love their \"special\" sauce and always ask for packets to take home, don't forget that request as it is yummy on the fries!  Great burgers and shakes however as I have said for years I just wish they had a different kind of French fries as those dried up  slivers of potatoes they call fries just don't cut it with me.  The only way I will order their fries is animal style.  We have loved there food for years since I had my first experience in San Diego, California back in the early 90's!  No need to make a long review, good food, service, quality, prices, and clean it is what it is.  Peace out!"}
{"text":"In N Out Burger is consistently great as their menu is simple and they stick to the same formula for success. I have been visiting here more lately as it is close to my place of employment and my buddy Sergio loves it for lunch!   The Amazing and always Super happy staff is ALWAYS a nice encounter. The food speaks for itself, fresh burgers with ultra fresh toppings with a unique bun and sauce.  They have a nice selection of drinks as well, I really like their pink lemonade and iced tea. They also make great handmade milkshakes as well which are a nice treat with a burger and fries.  I love their special sauce, I always ask for extra packets of it to dip my fries in if I don't order them animal style. I am not that crazy about the fries, sometimes they are so thin they are just too dry. If they would change their fry style I think that would be one of my dreams come true!  Mmmmm yummy good stuff! We will be back over and over again for a burger fix!"}
{"text":"Customer service is perfection here - courteous employees who smile and go out of their way to make sure you have a good meal. Good burgers & fries. I get mine protein style - wrapped in lettuce - because I'm gluten free. Non meat-eaters can get grilled cheese. My kids LOVE the shakes here - made with real ice cream."}
{"text":"Well I came here two days in a row for lunch so I guess I can't really complain...the line moves fast at this location but it still takes a while for food to come out given the sheer number of people that order here. Objectively, I think Shake Shack and Five Guys serve a much more delicious burger, but for the price, you really can't beat In-N-Out. Eating In-N-Out for three days also did not make me feel disgustingly greasy or anything, which I feel like after I'm done eating at Five Guys. I do have to say that their fries, even animal style, lack a lot of texture and flavor - stick to the burgers."}
{"text":"Am I rating this In N' Out, or all In N' Outs? I can't be certain, but I know this location was clean, bright and staffed with friendly people who seemed genuinely happy to be doing their jobs. I think this speaks to how well the company treats their employees, but whatever it is, it makes for a great experience.  And ohmygod, the food. I make a point to go to In N' Out on any trip I make to the West coast. Each bite of a double double animal style is like taking a bite out of an angel's halo. And I will tear into the French fries like nobody's business, even though I try to avoid them at other restaurants...I mean, especially fast food restaurants. This is fast food at a different level.   Crowning achievement, the chocolate milkshake. Or get a neopolitan if you're feeling fancy. I will sign a petition In N' Out to come eastward. In fact, I'll knock on doors to get others to sign it too. Although this could make me quite fat. Let me rethink this."}
{"text":"My daughter took me there today to have lunch. The food was good and hot.Yummy mahalo my Savannah"}
{"text":"Best burgers anywhere. No.1 At in and out is the best value by far. This chain beats all others fast food places."}
{"text":"I will forever be an In-n-Out fan!!  I love the fresh veggie's on my animal style cheeseburger and the spread, oh the spread.  I love the cheese fries with extra spread on the side to dip my cheese fries in.  Yummy Yummy!!"}
{"text":"First time here and service was exceptional! Terence is the man! He gave us hats and hung out with us. This location is really service-oriented. Terence encouraged us to take pictures, Instagram, and Facebook our experience haha. Will definitely come back here next time I go to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Pretty good burger spot, nothing out of ordinary, but nonetheless it satisfies the taste buds!    P.S.- When you go ask for animal style for a extra umph to your burger!"}
{"text":"This was one of my worst experiences at In N Out so far. I wanted a cheeseburger with whole grilled onions and a animal style fry. Ok that's pretty simple right. She got it wrong 3 times she gave me a animal style burger with a reg fry and a drink ???? How do you get that out of what I just said?????? Must have been daydreaming or had a blonde moment but usually In N out is on point 100% of the time. I waited about 20 minutes for my food and the place was practically dead. Cali In N Outs get the job done but Vegas man they need to regroup and weed out the slackers and hire people that are worth 11 an hour. This place reminds me of a cross between McDonalds and Wendy's service wise"}
{"text":"Consistent, yummy, not healthy food. Delicious. Had a Bank of America deal for $2.50 cashback after purchase, which is a free single burger.  Fries always excellent when hot."}
{"text":"Cheap...pretty much the only word I can think of. In a pinch it is ok but not the best. Long wait which is annoying for a fast food that is called In and Out (seriously!) The fries had a weird texture, almost like they didnt sit in the fryer for the right amount of time. The burger was alright-but dont expect to be mind blown (huge plus that it wasnt greasy at all which is atypical for a cheap burger place)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best fast food burger you can buy. Unfortunately they don't have these in the east coast, at least not in the DMV area.  Fries are nothing to write home about.  Of you have never tried their Burgers, and you live burgers, this is a must"}
{"text":"Love love love In N' Out! Hands down the best fast food there is and I don't even like fast food. I wish they had them in the East Coast. I recommend trying the Animal Style and Burgers. (Secret Menu) - I order a healthier option called the \"Protein Burger\" just to try it."}
{"text":"I'm not a meat eater but that doesn't keep me from Thick ass shake & hot fries. The few times I've been here I'm greeted respectfully. Asked for my order by ma'am or miss. Very well trained staff. Quick with the orders. And have never had a wrong order. Sooo clean. Even the parking lot is clean. I'm real big on clean. The windows and floor are cleaner then my house. This is just a well run joint."}
{"text":"This place just opened up and it was a huge success.  They are a typical in-n-out with their signature burger, fries and shakes.  Even thought I'm pretty sure they are still training staff, this place seems to be doing very well.  The staff was friendly, the drive through was quick, and my order was right.  The food was cooked to the quality that you'd expect from in-n-out.  The bonus for me is this place is much closer to my house than any other one, so the food was still hot when I got home."}
{"text":"It's a typical in n out with good food and a clean restaurant.  Parking lot can be a bit tricky when it's busy, but they do a good job getting you through. Never had to wait too long and my order is always right."}
{"text":"What an over hyped chain. Let's start at the basics, the fries, nothing special, got them animal style and regular, go with the animal style. It's a basic burger which many west coasters over hype for no reason. There is no flavor in the meat, small patty that' over cooked. Stick with Gordon Ramsey BURGR in Vegas, so much better. Don't understand the hype behind this chain. Wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"yum.  double-double, animal style, side of fries, and chocolate shake.  put a perfect ending to my first time in vegas.  yum yum."}
{"text":"yes pls.. love the location.. half way between home and vegas!!"}
{"text":"We come here all the time and service is always great! Especially tonight, 10/17/16 around 7pm we had a nice service from a guy wearing glasses (sorry, I didn't get his name from the tag). He cleaned our table nicely before we sat down, came to ask how the food was and cleaned the tray for us. We also had some extra fries and he offered us a paper bag for take away. This small little things made our visit very enjoyable. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I don't care if I'm hung over, starving or even if I already ate dinner and want a midnight snack.. In n out burger is always the best!!    But you can't just order like a plain old cheeseburger and expect it to be the best thing ever.  You need to customize that bad boy and eat it fresh!!  My favorite is a double double animal style with onions both ways and chopped chilis.  Order that with a side of extra crispy animal style fries and a shake and you've got a worthy last meal!    I really wish In n Out would open in Hawaii!! I love your burgers so much!"}
{"text":"This location is very busy but the quality of the burgers are excellent. Staff are all polite and friendly. They quickly clear tables so that people can sit right away."}
{"text":"When I think of a great American cheese burger made fresh and in an incredibly clean environment I think of in and out burger. This location is always busy and it opens up at 10:30am days a week. Mom and dad always want to eat here when they come in town. Staff is consistently super friendly, which always makes you feel good about eating there. Food is delicious I always get a double double but sometimes I get a 3 x 3 which is not on the menu. Get grilled onions!"}
{"text":"Being a born and raised California guy I could eat In-N-Out everyday and never get sick of it! They are just so consistent with the quality and taste of the burger that I simply cannot resist eating here whenever the craving arises! Seriously love this place! My go to burger is a double meat burger animal style with whole grilled onions instead and an extra toasted bun! And if you don't get the fries and drink your total comes out to like $3.50!!!! Incredible deal and I'm already excited to come back here again soon!"}
{"text":"expect to wait in long lines and fight for a table inside or out. This place is popular and hyped for a reason... It's just good.  stepping off the plane, my friend and I wanted our very first stop to be In-N-Out, so we took a taxi there...yep, WITH our luggage...and found a table near probably the only outlet in the place, where the workers kept coming by asking if we were fine... not even giving us any sort of fuss about charging our phones and waiting for our third person to arrive two hours later. *quick shout out to worker Ed for making us laugh with stories about how much Spirit Airlines sucks*  So the food:  I did a little research and found out about the secret menu and ordered the Double Double - Animal Syle combo. This was fast food but it was so different from McDonald's or Burger King. The beef tasted fresher and the animal style hint of mustard plus the secret sauce really made it stand out.   No matter what time you go, there's always a line but the employees (there's like 40 people back there) are quick and organized.  I really respect that the chain doesn't expand towards the east coast. It gives tourists something to look forward to when they arrive."}
{"text":"Yes! In n Out with fresh cut ( in plain view) and deep fried french fries. Busy drive through but ple space inside and nice and cool respite from the 106 weather."}
{"text":"amazing burgers best fried and awesome people and prices what more can you ask for a quick burger always happy with the choice of in n put would take this over any fast food"}
{"text":"I like that In and Out doesn't have an extensive menu due to the fact I am very indecisive! But what you do get is a very good burger and really good fries! In and out has retired McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, etc from my semi monthly menu selection! Prepared hot and stated hot until I arrived home...say what?!?! Fries weren't soggy but remained warm too. They are very considerate regarding how they wrap the burgers as well! Keeping a potentially messy situation under wraps! Pun absolutely intended! Minimalistic fast food dining at its finest lol! I am a fan! Check them out!"}
{"text":"Holy cow. Woah. I had heard all the hype, but I dismissed it.  You see, I come from the land of McDs and BK and other revolting and disappointing \"burgers,\" so I just didn't know. I didn't know!   I normally detest fast food, but I don't even think In-N-Out truly belongs in that category. This, my friends, was a (cheese) BURGER!   Then I returned the land of gross burgers, with nothing but the memory of what I WISH fast food tasted like here in the Northeast."}
{"text":"Excellent service abd awesome animal fries and burgers every thing is great fast service"}
{"text":"I had heard so much about this place that I wanted to try it out. It was sooooo crowded and you had to fight to get a table. Everything tasted great going down but it wasn't very filling and it did bad things to my stomach. Let's just say I tried it."}
{"text":"The 1984's red, yellow, and white lay out sets the stage for their paralyzingly good burgers. After greedily eating my Double Double Animal Style and Well Done Fries (that put Shake Shack to shame), I instantly jump on my phone and rub it into my East coast friend's face. I evoke those meals like children recalling Halloween treats, or Christmas presents."}
{"text":"absolutely disgusting. i dont know how people can eat this \"food\". EXTREMELY GREASY, even when compared to mcdonalds..... (will give you the .... ). My burger was undercooked, i suppose this doesn't happen to everyone but made my burger unpleasant.  There \"fries\" taste like lays potatoe chips, which is okay for some people i guess...  That is this New Yorkers final word and first and last time there."}
{"text":"As far as Burger joints go: In and Out is perfect to me. They have a limited menu which means they're going to get it right.  Sadly, I have stopped eating meat again...so I'd really like if they had some delicious alternative to cuddly cow flesh. Still, I keep coming back for the animal fries. I know they're sooo bad for me...there's something seedy, dirty, decadent, bad and wrong about them - So of course I have to have them!  Everyone's got their fave burger place, this is mine. They're open late so that's helpful as well. Sweet : )"}
{"text":"You are likely not familiar with In-N-Out Burger unless you have ventured to the West Coast. Their menu is streamlined and simple. You can only get a burger and fries. If it's your first time get it \"animal style\" which is with thousand island dressing and grilled onions. I typically eat healthy, but will occasionally treat myself to In-N-Out Burger that's how good this place is."}
{"text":"not crowded and friendly staff, tables were slightly dirty and unattended."}
{"text":"As busy as they can possibly be from open to close    They do a stand up job especially considering the turnover in the mostly student employees    Always fresh ingredients ( impossible for anything to go stale here)  Today I ordered inside ( no line ) meanwhile outside  there was a 20 deep line of cars in the drive through    I still managed to get my perfectly prepared burger in 9 minutes    Great job InNout   4 stars for dirty tables and messy bathroom   even though I took to go  Update I have since visited 10 more times High turnover among staff, dirty bathrooms and tables.  rating now a 3"}
{"text":"Theyre doing alot of construction so the parking lots really messy but the guts are typical in n out decor. i like this shop cause its away from the strip so its no fulled up with tourists or vacationers and its right next to UNLV so i can only imagine how this place looks when class is in..  what do i order?  old fashioned double single w/ pickles. lighty cooked fries and an arnold palmer. 20 packets of black pepper on my ketchup. and 2 napkins.   what are you having??"}
{"text":"Handling burgers like a BOSS.  You know you'll get through a drive-thru lane that's wrapped around a building when they have a team of folks taking your order outside. This is a usual sighting at most In-N-Outs. Robots I tell you. ROBOTS!   Decided to drive through and we were in an out (pun intended) in less than five minutes. We had about ten cars ahead of us so I found this incredibly impressive. My classic order is the double-double, animal style. Those grilled onions are money. I'm not a fan of their fries but this visit I snuck a few from my buddy and they kinda hit the spot!   The burger was juicy and stayed together until the last bite. This was a full 5-star experience but I'm left with one question...  Why did I forget to order a milkshake?!"}
{"text":"In-n-Out = Chick-Fil-A. Questions?  You'll like anything and everything in the menu - ask if you want to customize it.  They'll give you recommendations if you'd like.   I'm a fan of Animal Style, extra Thousand with Fries extra Crispy."}
{"text":"let's face it - In & Out - AMAZING  The fries are pretty good too but the burgers are something special. When you can't get one every day it's painful but it makes it even better when you come back. If you don't know the pain of not getting to have one - well you're lucky and you'll miss it the day you can't.   What makes ANY In & Out burger great is the price. Let's face it best burger you can get for such a great price. There are burger joints that have good burgers and come close but you can't match the quality, taste and price you get at In & Out Burger."}
{"text":"When it comes to fast-food/quick service burger joints, In-n-Out wins hands down. Their menu has not changed much in the last 50 years which shows they have a solid product. And for those in the know, their secrect menu add's that little extra to the burger or fries that just makes it out of this world.... Animal style anyone?   So do yourself a favor and pay homage to the almighty of fast food burger joints.   And on a side note, there is nothing I crave more after a long trip overseas then a #2 with grilled onions, animal style fries and a coke. Hell, I think that is why they always have an In-n-Out close to every major airport in California, Nevada and Arizona!"}
{"text":"It's the In n Out that I had spent many years at during my time at UNLV. Many Animal Style fries and cheeseburgers later, I feel I owe it to the good folks of In-n-Out to review them . And while their prices have gone up, I can always count on them and this location to provide me with some hot, artery clogging goodness.   In-n-Out you are truly in a class of your own."}
{"text":"Finally tried the perennially hyped in-n-out, and this place does it right. I personally don't like all of these in-n-out vs Five Guys arguments cause the two joints are too different to compare. In my mind, they satisfy different cravings. Can't we all just get along?  Got a double double and some fries animal style when I was in Vegas my first time, and it hit the spot. Also, the fries tasted more like potatoes than at any other fast food joint I've tried, so that was a pleasant surprise. Pairs well with Pedialyte."}
{"text":"PRO:   A good simple menu and friendly staff which applies to all locations. Don't go on a Sunday or Saturday, especially at night--the line will be a mile long and can take an hour.  CON:  TRUE story--you can't make this stuff up.  I ordered two burgers, started eating and felt a \"string\" like thing in my mouth.  Figured it was fat in the meat.  Started eating the other one with cheese and same thing.  So I took the burgers apart and I couldn't believe what i was seeing--red hair everywhere.  Not on the meat but COOKED IN THE MEAT!  This doesn't happen by accident folks.  I showed this mess to the manager and made sure he saw it was cooked IN the meat so there was no way I put it there.  I also pointed out it was red hair and I had only seen one person in the back with red hair so it was obvious who the guilty party was. All he would do is give me a coupon for two free burgers.  I really wanted to have the little red headed bastard come out and explain what his issue was but I just left.  Hope they fired his ass. It took me 4 months to get the urge to go back to In & Out.  So for that I am removing a star.  But four stars is still good and the food is good too."}
{"text":"Located across the street from Caesars Palace. We stopped here to grab a quick burger for CM. I am slightly disappointed at the fact that this California based family chain is spreading out, which might eventually result in their quality going down."}
{"text":"I'm upset with this place. I've been to 3 other In and Outs and I don't care for this one. There have been several times that we got pink meat in the burgers. I mean completely pink. It's overly greasy and dripping with the liquid fat. If you like In and Out there are better ones and if I compared this place to 5 Guys, 5 Guys wins hands down."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The high quality is standard. It is loud and even though they are crowded a lot and get a lot of business their quality doesn't cut corners. Way better than McDonalds!  Oh and the misconception about In-N-Out is that they're more expensive than most typical crappy food chains like McDonald's. Which is not true. For a cheeseburger with the typical vegetables compared to a Bacon McDouble sandwiched in bleach white bread at McDonald's it's the same price.  Excellent quality, employees wear gloves, they are extremely friendly and attentive to the customers needs and don't argue, everything is consistently organized, their coke products are ALWAYS fresh unlike the McDonalds across the street who have ghetto people with shitty ass cocky attitudes and give you hardcore attitude, this place RESPECTS customers.  Don't spend your hard earned money at a crappy place like McDonalds(because cheaper prices mean cheaper experiences). Spend it somewhere that actually respects the money you earn. From what i was told when i tried to get a job there, the employees at In-N-Out actually love their job because of the good pay they earn, the organization of the work, the simplicity of the menu, and the consistency in business they get from the quality they serve unlike McDonalds where the employees feel like they have to work their and hate their lives and only work for a paycheck."}
{"text":"You kept me fed in Vegas. This place was my addiction. Oh sure, you can gamble, mess with women hotter than the sun, and drink free, but the burger is what kept me up at nights. I don't know what it is you do at this location, but keep doing it.   Fresh cut fries. In a fast food joint. Why don't more places do this?"}
{"text":"A simple menu for a basic carryout business. At a moments glance you have this 1950's ice cream soda pop shop vibe, which adds to the experience of the In-N-Out Burger. Yes, it is true this is the spot for cheap eats, but expect to wait your turn because there will be a line depending what time you go. We went around 5PM or so and it was busy.  I do like the fact you can observe your food being prepared and that they use real ice cream for the milk shakes. What's even better is the off the menu items and ordering terminology this place has. If you don't know what I'm talking about...you better ask somebody or keep reading the previous reviews.  Although Las Vegas is known for their extreme buffets, try and slip away for a moment for a juicy...but messy cheeseburger. It's worth every bite!"}
{"text":"In n out...enough said! Amazing customer  service, fresh ingredient and French friends cut and made in front of you daily. I love the double double cheeseburger, protein style, with a chocolate milkshake. Why oh why can't they migrate out to the east coast and Florida!! My ultimate favorite fast food and it's always a treat to go!"}
{"text":"Reliable, priced right, and pretty tasty. Always great friendly service here, the place is kept clean, and food is fresh.  Why aren't all drive thru places like this?"}
{"text":"Double-Double, no sauce, cheese fries, diet root beer...  This is all I ever order at any In-N-Out (i loathe russian dressing)  This is where i go when I come to AZ to visit family.  What else is there to say about In-N-Out that hasn't been said??? An awesome place to get a cheeseburger."}
{"text":"Eat at the 5th St often  always fast even when the drive thru is crazy at dinner time"}
{"text":"Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. I mean it's In-N-Out. What else do you need. The food was delicious as always. And as a person with Celiac's Disease, I can always come here without anxiety. Because they are careful with their food, and I've never gotten sick. And of course, service is wonderful. Everyone who works here is so nice. I wish I lived closer! But it's probably good that I don't...cause I'd be here every day."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of fast food but In-N-Out is the exception to the rule. Whenever I am on the West Coast In-N-Out is a must. I landed in Las Vegas at 10:30 and I was at In-N-Out by noon.   Their double cheeseburgers are a thing of beauty and I love their fries. And did I mention the unbelievable sauce (essentially thousand island) that is available. I dip my fries in it and drench my burger with it as well.   Just all around one of the best guilty pleasures. I absolutely love In-N-Out and am somewhat thankful they are not on the East Coast. I would be a house if they were."}
{"text":"This is pretty much always my first stop after picking up my rental car when in Las Vegas.  This is probably the busiest location in Las Vegas as it's the closest to the airport and The Strip.  They are always busy and there's always a line but they work pretty quickly and efficiently that the wait time isn't too long.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating available.    The customer service is always pretty good both inside and at the drive-thru.  What I thought was pretty neat was that when you order from the drive-thru, they ask if you'll be eating in your car because they give you paper place mats to put on your lap if you plan to eat in your car.  Pretty nifty In-N-Out!  Their menu is simple yet so satisfying.  They only offer a few types of burgers but they do the job pretty well.  You can also ask for \"animal style\" burgers or fries, it's their own concoction of a sauce-very similar to Thousand Isle dressing.  I've had it but the burgers and fries taste delicious all on their own and you don't really need the dressing.   I love, love, LOVE their french fries because they're freshly cut potatoes.  You can actually see the employees behind the counter using their handy-dandy potato slicer.  This makes that much of a difference because the fries taste so much better if they haven't been frozen.    I think it's awesome that this location draws so many tourists.  Every time I'm here, I feel like I'm at the airport.  One, because it's so busy and two because I always see so many tourists and hear all types of accents.  There have been numerous times where I'll see a couple with like, 4 burgers and 4 orders of fries just trying to get their In-N-Out fix as they don't have one back home.  It's pretty hilarious but totally understandable.    I really wish there was an In-N-Out back home in Hawaii. We desperately need some good quality and low-priced fast food joint like this!"}
{"text":"I failed in my attempt to dine in at a less busy In-N-Out Burger than the one closer to the Las Vegas Strip. Is there even such a thing? I thought by going to this location on Sahara, I wouldn't have to deal with the crowds. The parking lot was packed and we actually had to wait for someone to leave so that we could park.  It was crowded inside but the line moved fairly quick. Customer service was great, like it is at all of the other In-N-Outs I've been to.   What I love about In-N-Out is the simplicity of everything. They have such an easy and simple menu but it works perfectly. I got my usual Double-Double with fries and it didn't let me down. I finally tried their chocolate milkshake which was a bit disappointing. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.  Although it was busy and crowded, I was still a happy camper. I don't know how anyone can not be happy after having a burger and fries from In-N-Out!"}
{"text":"The usual great food. But the customer service was phenomenal   They brought us our food when we sat outside so we didn't have to wait inside. Everything was so clean and we love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent hamburger and fries.  Clean fun restaurant.  My little Nino once wore his In n out burger shirt to a ballgame.  The player saw his shirt and said he goes there every time he gets back home in Los Angeles.  Good enough for major league ball players and regular folks alike."}
{"text":"This In n out is nothing special. In fact, I think it might be the busiest In n Out in the city. Every time I'm here, this place is always slam packed. That's really the main issue with this particular In n Out. It could take you a solid 10-15 minutes to get your food just because it's so backed up.   Also, this In n Out is a little dirtier than the other In n Out's. I have a feeling it has something to do with the area. This one is right off the strip so I can't imagine who's going in and out of that place. I guess it's to be expected of a fast food joint right by the strip.  Aside that, it's still In n Out at its core. The food and staff are no different than any other In n Out. The food tastes just as delicious and the staff is just as courteous as any other facility.   Would I recommend this In n Out? - not if I had another option. At the same time, it's In n Out so I don't really think I care what it looks like or how busy it is. I'm going just for the food."}
{"text":"This location because of its inept, slow, cashier only gets one star!!!  Food here is delicious, that is if you get your order filled correctly, which ours was NOT.  This was due to the absolutely clueless cashier that we had, she couldn't get anything right from our double-double protein, animal style to the accuracy of the shakes we ordered, she couldn't even get TAKE-OUT right.  What an unpleasant experience at this location.  As busy as this place is you'd think that the manager would have qualified/competent cashiers manning the front instead they had one girl (unfortunately we got her) that must have been very new and wasn't aware of how to key in items and one who just walked away from her register for a good ten minutes allowing the lines to wrap around the restaurant.  Our order was so screwed up!!!!!!  Management Pay Attention to your Front Registers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We love In & Out Burger and it is a must when we have people visiting from the east coast.  I recommend Animal Style or Protein Style burgers as well as animal style fries. There is something awesome about the pink lemonade too if you don't want one of their milk shakes.  I've never had a bad experience at In & Out and the staff are always welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"The best fast food I have ever had, I do not eat fast food, except for this and Five Guys. I have eaten at In N Out my whole life and they always provide a good quality quick meal. I would definitely suggest getting a black-white shake (on the hidden menu), just ask for it and they will give it to you. The black & white shake consists of a half chocolate milkshake and half vanilla milkshake mixed together. It is truly delicious, I enjoyed that as well as the fries which are cut in house before every day, fresh (which is very rare to have fresh things in this day and age). The burger was very good, and has a very good secret sauce (some similiar formula to thousand island) onthe burger which really makes all the other flavors pop out and taste delicious. The food there is near perfect for fast food, and also the staff is incredibly nice and helpful as well ad hard-working. I would suggest this place to anyone who is lacking time but still searching for a good cheap meal."}
{"text":"This is a very popular location and I can see why! The food was consistent with Traditional In-N-Out Burger. Customer service was great! The good was very good! We got good seating and parking! No complaints!"}
{"text":"#1 double burger with fries, both Animal style, and a chocolate shake.    Awesome quantity of fries and the burger was hot with a lot juice.  Went in super hungry and left content.  Short wait time and great staff, would definitely go again next time I visit Arizona."}
{"text":"I am from the east coast, so I think I am a little over complementary at this time, but I do like this place.  The service is always top notch and the food is good.  My typical order is the double double animal style with well done animal style fries.  It cannot be beat.  I would recommend to anyone.  One of the best fast food experiences I have had."}
{"text":"They can't take your order properly and the burger was under cooked and the bun was soggy.  I couldn't even eat it.  By far the worst in in out I've ever been to.  They need a lesson in customer service and better cooks!"}
{"text":"Always busy but always great!  Perfect pit stop for quick bites! Plus! It's In n Out... you cant complain! ^_^  Fresh burger w/ onion grilled or not of your choice & Protein burger with fresh lettuce *thumbs up*  Parking can be a pain in the butt, but its like this at EVERY In n out!  Seating available inside and outside so not bad at all!"}
{"text":"Hurry hurry hurry Hurry hurry hurry Hurry hurry hurry Hurry hurry hurry Hurry hurry hurry  Lucinda and I walked in just after they opened so it wasn't busy.  I wanted to glance at the menu for a moment but they were in a tremendous hurry for us to place our order.  Better know what you want in advance or stand back so they can't corral you into placing your order.  If you step up to read the menu they'll pounce.  Large fries.  We only have one size, do you want more than one?  Well, how big is it?    Shouting in a very grating voice, the order taker repeated:  We only have one size, do you want more than one?   She's very impatient, demanding an immediate answer.  I wanted to tell her:  Take a breath.  It's not busy yet.  Just relax and let us place our order. Allow me to ask a fucking question about the fries.  \"I understand the concept of just one one size and I'm not hard of hearing.\"  She didn't respond. If a customer expresses displeasure just act like you didn't hear it. Since there is no way to gauge how many fries are in an order, we asked for two servings.   One order is plenty, it turns out.  The fries were limp and saturated with stale grease.  I asked for my double double with grilled onions.  The burgers came with no indication which had onions.  No onions.  Some fast food eateries will put a mark on the wrapping to let you know it has onions.  At In N Out it's part of the secret menu.  Whether you actually get onions when you want them is their secret.  Everyone shouts here.  Very loud, hectic, and annoying.  Very unpleasant.  They're all hurry hurry, hurry hurry.  I could understand if it were busy but the store was practically empty.  The burgers are just fair, no better than Burger King or Carl's Jr.  The \"cheese\" is not actual cheese but a glue-like product that sticks to your teeth & gums.   You want bacon?  Forget bacon.  In N Out's secret of success is very limited choices.  And if they don't feel like it, you won't get one of the few choices they offer.  I'll be in no hurry to return."}
{"text":"Always enjoy the burgers and fries! Service is great and everyone always so friendly! Prices are very reasonable and everything is so fresh!"}
{"text":"Can you really go wrong when eating at In-N-Out!? Always deliciously fresh food! I always go with a cheeseburger lite spread and grilled onions and animal style fries and fresh brewed iced tea.... sometimes I totally splurge and get a vanilla milkshake! (sooooooooooooo YUMMY!)"}
{"text":"I lived in southern California until just recently so in n out has been a basic staple of my diet. This is another location that is exactly what you hope for and expect from the brand, only a bit slower than some others I've been to (though all of them have their slow times with how busy they get). Even with the completely dead mall as a neighbor this place is always packed and with a long drive thru line.  Fantastic burgers and fries with a taste others don't replicate at all served with the most genuine smile you'll find in the fast food industry."}
{"text":"I love In-N-Out Burger! They must be doing something right because they're always busy, no matter the time of day! The drive-thru line is always poppin' and the inside always a bustlin' but it's definitely worth it for the price and quality! I love getting the number two, no onions, buns extra toasted, extra spread, and chopped banana peppers inside with the fries light well done and a pink lemonade....man am I needy. But it's just so delicious. Just try avoiding long lines, but sometimes it's ineeeevitable."}
{"text":"This is my go to in-n-out. Where I had my first in-n-out burger. Where I fell in love with the spread sauce. And where I decided that in-n-out would be my most favorite fast food place there is. I'm very needed when it comes to in-n-out and they definitely exceed my expectations every time. Bun extra toasted, extra spread and tomatoes, when I'm feeling frisky I like to get chopped chilis (but dang that stuff gets hot), and the fries light well (just get it like that, trust me). They're always so nice and happy. They talk really fast so make sure you're listening when they repeat your order. And the pink lemonade is too addicting for me to handle. Try and put black pepper in your ketchup and squeeze some chili pepper juice into it (YUM). Dip your fries in it and you have an awesome meal. Gosh, I would have in-n-out any day!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located next to UNLV, always expect this location to be busy busy busy. I mean cmon, you've got a university full of people from the east coast who've never had In N Out before!   This location never fails me. They're always fast, nice, and clean. Also very accurate with my order (because I am needy). I usually get a number 2, with no onions, buns extra toasted, extra spread, extra tomato, chopped chilis, and the fries done light well (you know how they have flimsy fries, well this way they're a bit crispier, and not as hard as if you would order it extra crispy- that makes them either hard as rock or stiff like potato chips). Pink lemonade is a must! And ketchup with pepper mixed (and a splash of chili juice) is the way to go.  Ugh I'm drooling and craving once again."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to try In-N-Out and White Castle for the first time on my vacation.  In-N-Out Burger won by a landslide.  Superior burger at a cheaper price.    5 STARS BOOMTOWN"}
{"text":"I don't get it... it is a fast food joint.  The burgers are okay and the staff is great!  But how do they turn real potatoes into those weird things they call French fries?  They are okay as long as they are hot but let them cool down and they get this strange texture.  It isn't terrible and the price is right but it wouldn't be my first choice.  They do hire and or train exceptional staff."}
{"text":"After trying In N Out a few times, I just don't see the appeal.  The burgers are skimpy, about 2oz.,  so you really need to order at least a double.  Both the burger and fries are bland, had to add salt, and the fries although they are cut fresh are never crisp, maybe the use oil lower in saturated fat ?  I gave it two stars for the ingredients being fresh, but I'd rather have a thick juicy burger, and crispy fries, that you can get fresh at other restaurants easily."}
{"text":"Keep doing what you guys do best, thanks for the great service and quality of food."}
{"text":"Your standard, crazy, always busy location...  ...and worth it!  Go for the double/double combo animal style, and thank me later (after you recover from bliss)."}
{"text":"One of the main reasons why its hard to even think about leaving the West Coast. I love you guys, thank you for feeding my family when we are craving for deliciously grilled burgers with animal style fries and a good old cola.   I mean what else is there to say? In n out has the tastiest burgers in Vegas. I'm sorry but I don't agree with the new burger places. In n out still beats em all!"}
{"text":"If you want a great cheeseburger, this is the place! Everything is freshly made, and their sauce takes it from ordinary to extaordinary."}
{"text":"I hate to leave one star for In-N-Out seeing as I'm a die hard fan but this was lame. Placed my order. Number 2 (cheeseburger) mustard fried with onions add chopped chilies AND ketchup in the burger along with their fabulous spread with an Arnold Palmer. Lady taking my order repeated my order and didn't mention ketchup. So I asked \"Did you get the ketchup on the burger too?\" She said (with extreme confidence) \"Yes!\" I pull up to the window to pay. The lady there (not sure if she was the same one taking the order thru the speaker) repeats my order back to me. Once again no mention of ketchup. I ask if they got the ketchup on the burger. She says no but she'll get it added on. I get my receipt at 4:40 and then wait for the 2 cars in front to go and it's not a long wait before they pull off. I pull up to the window and wait longer than the last two cars. I get my food at 4:52. Guess what? You got it! NO KETCHUP IN MY BURGER and the fries are overdone. So In-N-Out is known for their burgers, fries, and shakes. They got 2 out of 3 wrong. And that's just because I didn't get a shake so you can't screw that up I suppose. If you're gonna only have 3 things on your menu perhaps those three things should come out right. My Arnold Palmer however was made correctly hence the one star. Lady at the food window did also apologize for the wait so that was nice. I'm not in a rush so I don't have a problem waiting, but if I wait and they still get it wrong, that kinda sucks. I've posted a picture of the fries and the receipt."}
{"text":"Dang it, In-N-Out! Why must you always lure me back in with your buttery buns? Somehow I can't resist your inexpensive patties and crisp green lettuce... not to mention your sauce. Delish, I say.  You've even managed to make me start enjoying your odd french fries. I can't understand it, though I'm sure it's along the lines of sorcery or Jedi mind trickery.  So why when there are a thousand other burger joints out there do I keep coming back to you? I'm ashamed of myself. But not really.  And at this point, I'm not sure if it's me or you. Whatever the case, we both know I'll be back."}
{"text":"It's a ritual to eat here if you visit the West Coast, but I'm not quite sure about this one.  I had the double-double with fries. The burger was good, but not great. I got everything I'd want out of a burger, but it didn't really hit the spot like a shack stack would to be honest. Much better than McDonalds or Burger King that's for sure. The fries is what really got me. It was the absolute worst fries I've ever had. No exaggeration, it tasted like cardboard. Now I see why people order it \"animal style\" to mask how absolutely tasteless their fries are. My friend assured me that it's much better in California (probably true). I made the big mistake of having my first In n Out experience in Vegas apparently.  In conclusion, In n Out isn't that great in Vegas. You should try Carl's Jr. instead which was my favorite. Fat Burger is decent too."}
{"text":"This is not a restaurant it's a burger machine!  Wow what an operation 20 people working like high speed robots.   Oh and the burgers and fries are awesome. I vote them best in class. Wish they would open in Miami!!!"}
{"text":"They don't go by the order number, Instead they jump the order. The folks are disorganized. They should get their act together."}
{"text":"The busiest in-n-out you'll ever go to.  Expect about a 23 minute wait for food.  The burgers are great and the shakes are good.  I've never liked their fries.    Also sick value."}
{"text":"OK.  You either like or don't like In-N-Out, I'm not going to try to convert anyone.  I think they're a good burger, they're not expensive, and I love their fries.  I also like their corporate ethos of raising their own products and how they help teen employees with scholarships.  Very nice.  And this location is your typical In-N-Out, always busy at lunch, standard white & red decor, etc.  So why am I giving them two stars?  Because of their totally asinine parking configuration.  If you are approaching on Bell or on 83rd Ave southbound, you're screwed.  Your first opportunity to turn around has a sign that says No U Turns, though it's ignored regularly.  So you turn in to the parking lot, expecting to connect to it.  Your expectations are about to be dashed.  They don't connect.  The only way to turn in to the parking lot would be to be northbound on 83rd.  There is no reason why the lots cannot connect, and for that reason, I'm giving them two stars and don't plan on returning here.  I have more than enough frustration in my life, and there are plenty of In-N-Outs, and other places, that have much more accessible parking.  Maybe they'll fix it some day, but I won't hold my breath."}
{"text":"This is the best fast food burger I've ever had. The burger was a nice size and juicy. I also loved the taste of the animal sauce and the crispness and freshness of the veggies. Totally worth it. The double double combo is less than $9...impressive to find food of this quality for this cheap in a town with so many overpriced establishments. The chocolate shake was also very good. My only complaint is that the fries, while tasty, were a tad undercooked, hence the one star deduction. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Sooooo this was my first time eating here and I must say it was chaotic. When we walked in we were first in line, we both got the double burger, 1 regular fry, 1 animal fry. We got our number, turned around, and there were probably a crowd of 60/70 ppl waiting for their food. Figuring it'll take a while, we looked for seats. There is a tiny sitting area outside and half of the restaurant has seating, a lot of ppl opt in to sit on the fountain outside. As you can imagine, it's tough finding a seat. Luckily for me, I have no shame in preying on tables and quickly found a seat where a couple was just finishing up. It was about a 10-12 minute wait and then deliciousness. The burger was great, they put their signature animal sauce on it and it was very satisfying. The animal fries were A LOT, there was cheese, caramelized onions and topped with a ton of animal sauce. I've never heard of onions on fries before, but I was feeling adventurous and I'm glad I was. While I enjoyed them, they are definitely not something I would get every time, because like I said, it's a lot. I could not eat all of my fries, I was stuffed after that burger. AND it was the cheapest meal I had in Vegas, only about $21 for 2 ppl. This is a franchise I will definitely be supporting again."}
{"text":"Okay, since I've been in this country, In N Out has been my favorite BURGER place! I mean, for me it's the best no argument!. We live in Surprise and we had to drive  all the way to Peoria just to grab some burgahs hehe. and FINALLY they built this one out here, makes me and my tummy sooo happy! Lol  ^_^ everybody's happy, because as you can see they are always packed!  My favorite is their protein style burger, like it's soo heavenly good that I can have it everyday! haha  The service is great and food is amazing as always!  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Of all the burger places I've been, this one is one of my top 3 favorites! I just love everything in here especially their protein style burger which is good for those that are watching their diet! ;-) It's for sure the place to be!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this one place since it's only on the west coast! I thought it was very good for fast food, but nothing special. The burger was VERY thin--I would've got a double if I knew. The best part about the burger was the toppings. We got the burgers and one order of fries animal style (secret menu), which was delicious. Animal style includes extra Thousand Island spread, mustard grilled patties, and extra pickles. The fries were freshly made, but they're very plain and not that great. They asked if we were eating in the car or taking it to go, which was nice because they put the food in a box and gave us lap mats. The prices were good for fast food too. My husband would rate this place a 4/5 star, he loved it!! If I had to eat fast food, I would definitely choose this place over any other fast food chain!"}
{"text":"When you live somewhere that In-N-Out doesn't exist, you have to jump on the opportunity to grab some when you can. We were in Vegas for the weekend and knew this would for sure be one of our stops.   This particular In-N-Out is situated just slightly off the strip. We were there on a Monday afternoon, around 2:00pm. It was PACKED. Like, crazy busy. They were pretty efficient in handing guests, though, so it wasn't a big deal. There were zero tables to sit at inside or outside, so we opted for the the fountain. It was a warm day and the mist from the fountain felt nice anyway. But, be aware, seating can be difficult!   As far as the food goes - it was wonderful! Between the three of us, we had two double-doubles - one of them animal style, one single cheese burger, three orders of fries - two of them animal style. We were not able to even come close to finishing everything. Portions are very generous! I recommend sharing fries if you're not all that hungry!   And if you're not familiar with animal style, just try it! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh my goooooosh I wish we had these on my coast. I got an animal style cheeseburger and fries, but skipped the shake. The food was so so so so so good.  It's clearly made fresh, and the people who work there seem to care about the product they put out. The menu is simple. It's cheap. It's totally worth it. I miss In-n-Out already."}
{"text":"This place is always packed with a line at the drive-thru which is the only time I got Burgers here is the drive-thru I have not gone inside yet. The drive-thru line workers are friendly and greets you with a smile at this location. The french fries are nice and hot and crispy! The burgers are tasty here but nothing amazing. If you want cheap burgers and french fries then this is the place. I've had better quality burgers at other places but this is a good spot if you would like something fast easy and cheap! I am not a big fan of any in and out burger joints but that doesn't mean that I won't stop by for convenience. I might be back when ever I crave for a burger but don't have the time to sit around and wait to get one at a good restaurant. This is a good fast food joint."}
{"text":"I know everyone at in n out works extremely hard as it's always so crazy busy, but numerous times I've been in the drive thru for 20 minutes with only a few cars ahead of me! Not discrediting their sense of urgency but it sucks to be stuck for eternity in your DT!"}
{"text":"I love In N Out I come here at least 2 times a month! Some people say it's just a burger but it's far from that.   I don't know what's so special but the burgers melt in your mouth!   Always a fast paced atmosphere which is kinda cool!"}
{"text":"I try 2 limit In-N-Out 2 a minimum so when I do have it, its off the hook...I had it the otha night afta not having it 4 a few months...That sh!t was soooo on point...No lie...Burger was burnt, jus right...Fries were soooo bomb...Enuff said..."}
{"text":"Two words: Doggy, I mean ANIMAL STYLE. (Excuse my adult context, please keep children away from this review.)  Anyways, once you go black, I MEAN A-style, there's just no going back, period. ;-O  This is the best upgrade you could possibly do to a burger especially here! Can't believe it took me this long to discover their \"secret.\"   The components of ANIMAL STYLE is simple yet genius: + In-N-Out's thousand island spread (combined with...) + Caramelized, chopped onions (star of the show) + Cheese (if not a cheeseburger already)  Voila! Now take it down like the Animal you are! Cuz you're rough like that. ;-) It's a little messy but very manageable as you chomp your way through.  Wait, there's more! If you like a little kick, say: \"chopped chili's\"  Bam son! You got yourself some heat with that A-style.  Level 2 Complete.  Optionally, you can have a whole, uncut Chili Pepper on the side.  Its just not the burger you can apply the A-style to, yes, your fries can get the same treatment.  Unless you like it all sloppy and want to eat it with a fork, I would keep your fries untainted.    Well, there you have it, I hope I was informative and inspiring that you will now go try this \"Animal Style\" at an In-N-Out near you!"}
{"text":"So so happy that there's a location in Vegas!!! It's located slightly off strip but right in front of the LINQ high roller! It was a fantastic experience for being such a busy location! The staff were extremely organized and efficient in terms of taking orders and calling out the order numbers! I ordered the animal style burger and fries combo and due to sheer high volume everything tasted fresh and delicious!! Loved my experience there!!!!"}
{"text":"I used to be jealous that the east coast had whitecastle. Having had some, I've changed my mind.   Fresh ingredients, never frozen patties, fresh cut veggies and fries made to order, and great shakes. At a incredibly affordable price for the top quality food you're getting. The wait is usually longer, but that's how it should be. Real food should not be made at microwave speeds.  They also have the infamous secret menu.   My usual order: #3 (hamburger, double meat, whole grilled onion, and fries well-done)  Simple. Fresh. Cheap. Convenient.  This is the pinnacle of conventional fast-food establishments."}
{"text":"Come on people. What's the obsession about? The burgers are very simple. Do you realize the only thing that makes them different is thousand island sauce? The fries, on the other hand, are very unique and tasty. The malts/shakes are warm (is that possible?). Across the street, a McDouble is only a dollar and the fries are even better (everyone knows that). Plus, their shakes are somehow cold."}
{"text":"Pretty snazzy fries and a decent double double were my companions during this workday, and I must say they were truly good company. Perhaps if I was able to sit down and enjoy my meal rather than have to eat it on the go, I could have savored it much better. But, I'm in the process of streamlining our courier service and had to focus more on the navigation of the driver than this delicious burger and tasty fries, so something might have been lost in translation.  Needless to say, if I ever find myself transferred to our Mesa branch for the day, I know I'll stop by In-N-Out Burger to sate my loins."}
{"text":"It's another, average In n Out. Busy as all heck, but still polite service in a clean place. I've yet to have a burger here I didn't like, and the fries rock."}
{"text":"This was our first trip to Las Vegas and after doing some research on Yelp, we had to come here. First of all this place was packed on a Monday evening so I was a little  hesitant to go in. I'm so glad  we  did. The menu is simple  and the flow is fast and efficient. Quite affordable and great presentation. The burgers are fresh but  lacked  a little  on taste. Being from FL. I compared it to 5 Guys (no comparison ). The fries were good. I will go  back to try a shake  and Animal fries."}
{"text":"Having moved out of California and in to Houston, TX, I absolutely missed In-N-Out - the only fast food I'll ever cave for.  In-N-Outs are pretty consistent across the board, but I was a bit disappointed with this location, hence the -1 star.   My go-to order forever?: 1 cheeseburger, grilled onions, chopped chilies, medium rare. The guy at the counter told me they don't do medium rare...  Um... \"...\"  I don't see why they won't (or wouldn't), but I just said \"Ok\" and went about my day. While it temporarily filled the hole in my heart where In-N-Out goes, it was merely satisfactory, not outstanding (so yes, on your elementary-school-like report card, In-N-Out of Tempe, you get an \"S\", not an \"O\").  As a side note, give this a try, and see if they're willing to go along with what you want: http://aht.seriouseats.com/archives/2011/03/the-in-n-out-survival-guide-we-ate-every-single-item-on-the-secret-menu.html."}
{"text":"Food tastes good, I ordered the double double meal. Fries were cooked perfectly. Hamburger meat is thin so I'm glad I ordered the double double. Lettuce was bunch up in one place but that was easy for me to fix. Service was good. I don't expect a fast food joint to be a 5 star restaurant so for the money it was awesome!"}
{"text":"It's In n Out, yes it's fast food but you expect quality with a big name.  I have been here several times over the past couple of weeks and relative to other In n Outs it is pretty good. The employees are attentive and polite. Double doubles all day. I'll continue to go out of my way to stop at this location rather than other locations that are more central.   And for crying out loud people, don't ever go to In n Out and not get a Neapolitan shake.. War Eagle"}
{"text":"its in n out...of course its amazing! just order a #2 with grilled onions and you can then die happy. i usually go here whenever i start to feel homesick (im from california) anyhow....check it out!"}
{"text":"Always an excellent choice!  They never fail to offer superb standards of guest service and the food is always fresh and delicious! I love the animal style fries and cheeseburgers and they're amazing shakes!"}
{"text":"Ok I have been to a couple, few in AZ and Cali. Honestly its ok the staff is nice, and place is always clean. I had double double fries and shake. The Double double bread had a weird texture sort of frozen but not. The fries normally I get them cause there really great however I was really shocked no flavor places I have been to sometimes but a spice rub, this was just overly salt and pepper and lightly cooked. the shake was good. There are other really good burger joint out there but worth checking out. While I do admit this was first time being left kinda disappointed in a in and out burger place."}
{"text":"Great burgers and the service is truly best in class. Will return without question!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at an In-N-Out, I'll have to travel again to get some more.  If you want something other than a burger and fries go some where else, it's all you can order here. The claim is the burgers are never frozen, the fries are hand cut every day , the lettuce is washed fresh every day and the buns couldn't be fresher.  I believe all of this is true.  I will add that the buns are toasted perfectly.  There is a special sauce on the burger that gives it a nice tangy flavor.  The fries also have a perfect crunch and great flavor. The only drawback is the long wait for your meal but I know it was made with love and affection so I'm fine with it."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place when I lived in Vegas. My favorite memory was going here in our limo on the homecoming dance night in our suits with our ladies dressed to the hilt. That was truly an awesome night and a great experience. In N Out is a 5 outta 5 stars everywhere, they keep it simple and do what they're good at. Animal style 4X4 all the way!"}
{"text":"Maybe the best burger of any fast food chain. Great service and the double double is a masterpiece. They fries need a little work but the experience and flavor and the people make this a real all American fun and delicious place to eat!"}
{"text":"I mean, its In and Out Burger, I can think of at least 10 burger spots that I would go to before I came here. This is like the burger delicacy of PHX, LV, and So Cal... If that is the case, I will pass.   Don't get me wrong, the burger was good. But nothing that I would make a long distance call about. The fries, I could definitely do something different - as soon as I ate them, it reminded me that I should have just ordered another burger.   Overall, if you haven't tried it. Do it. It is an experience - and old school burger experience. If you have been here before and have the choice to go to another burger spot in AZ, live on the edge, try another spot."}
{"text":"Did a Taxi drive thru on Wednesday, ask for grilled onions on all four of my cheeseburgers and got none...  The service was fast, 6:30 pm and just two cars in the drive thru, suppose to be our lucky day... Any day, the burgers never fail, but no Grilled Onions this time.."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! No wonder it's always crowded lol. Excellent cheeseburgers and French fries! I even got a vanilla milkshake! The service was very good and the kids working there acted like they know what they are doing! A lot of people and no confusion. I wish I had stopped by months ago."}
{"text":"Did I miss something or what? My son brought me here for a late lunch after a Dbacks game. Passed on Chinese which I regret now. We purchased 2 doubles, a single, 3 FF's animal style and 2 large drinks to go. Total...$23 and change! I got the single thinking it would be enough for me. My mouth was watering thinking about a nice thick juicy burger. Wrong! The only thing juicy was the lettuce and tomatoes. I opened the burger to discover a 3 1/2 inch diameter, thin wafer of meat, dry as a bone. Some parts I could actually see through. It was thinner than McD's. 1/8th pounder? I couldn't even taste it. I think you need to order the triple to taste the meat. By the time we got home (5 min.) the cheese on the FF's congealed into one big glob. I ate it cause I was still hungry after the burger. I ate it like a potato pancake. It was unappealing but tasted OK. My son liked his meal?  I would go to BK's, McD's or Pete's any day of the week at 1/3 the price. Sorry son!"}
{"text":"The food here is the same great quality as all the other in n out locations, staff are extremely pleasant, etc.   The one HUGE drawback about this location is the wait time both in the drive through and inside. All in n out burgers are busy, you will never go to one where you can get your food instantly. However, this location constantly has so many cars in the drive through that the line actually forms out into the parking lot, blocking parked cars. Inside the wait is typically 15 minutes minimum. This location needs to do something to step up the speed."}
{"text":"This In-N-Out is always very busy, but always does a great job at getting everyone their food quickly. Even with how fast they get the food out, I've never had them mess up an order. All the employees have always been very friendly and the food has always been great."}
{"text":"Been going here since they opened.. never wrote a review, but nothing needs to be said..   Favorite - Triple Triple with grilled onions and cheese fries."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries as well as a good place to socialize and hang out.  Love coming here!"}
{"text":"I recently ate at in-n-out on the Vegas strip. The burger and fries were good. Shake was just ok. Shake Shack has better shakes in my opinion. The restaurant was busy with a lot of people working but also seemed disorganized compared to my experience at similar in-n-out's in California. Double/Double animals style was tasty. My friend got his fries extra crispy which made them like potato chips."}
{"text":"I originally came to this In-N-Out location after the first one I tried was totally filled up, drive-thru overflowing, and asshole employees. My brother raves about In-N-Out, and my mother wanted to try it. So we decided to give this one a try, and it was significantly better than the other one.   We walked in and they were busy. So we had to wait a bit. It wasn't a ridiculous wait though, it just wasn't quick. We all ordered burgers in a meal, so three burgers, three fries, and three drinks. It was kind of cool to look back in the kitchen and see an employee hand cutting the potatoes for the fries.   My brother ordered our fries to be extra crispy, which is how I always like mine. Well.. these were definitely crispy. They weren't burnt, and they get props for that. But they were actually too crispy for my taste. I didn't know that was possible. But it took away any sort of taste to them and just turned them into crispy cardboard. I wasn't a fan. But that's OK. I wish I hadn't let him order mine that crispy, so I could taste how they are normally. That would be my one regret.   Customer service was good. I had no complaints there, our orders were correct, served with a smile, and not ridiculous in price. The restaurant had obviously just had a rush, so things needed to be cleaned, but I did see employees go out to clean as things started to settle down.   Would I return? Probably. I mean, I don't find IN-N-Out nearly as spectacular as some people do, but that's just me. I'm always entertained by those who rave about it. But I had no complaints.   Review 182 of 2017."}
{"text":"Sadly, I didn't even get to visit this In-N-Out location because it was so busy the night we were there. It was something my mother wanted to try, and decided that's what we were doing for dinner that night. This was the closest location to where we were.   Unfortunately, the parking lot was completely filled, and the drive-thru was overflowing. So there was almost no chance of parking. My mother has a handicap placard and so we were going to park there. If we didn't, we would have to go find parking somewhere else, like a block or two away and then walk back to the restaurant.   What gives this place one single star is the fact the handicap parking place was filled... by an employee in uniform hanging out with his friends during his break. Obviously the friend couldn't find parking any better than we could, and just took a spot that wasn't meant for him. My brother, who was driving the car said something to the employee, who was very clearly just standing at the vehicle and talking/laughing with his friends. The employee basically said, sorry. Sucks to be you. It left a very bad impression. The employee treated it as if to say, look around. Do you really think you matter? This place is full. Who honestly gives a shit that you aren't going to eat here? That was the attitude this employee had, and it was absolute and complete disrespect. So we left.   Would I return? Absolutely not. I don't need to go somewhere that employees disrespect potential customers, as well as people with disabilities and their need to use a clearly marked handicap parking space to bullshit with their friends on a busy night. There's more than one In-N-Out in Vegas. We went to find another one, and I'm glad we did. They didn't treat it like a frat house either.   Review 122 of 2017."}
{"text":"This is the only fast food restaurant I go to.. Love the burgers and fries with a cold sweet  lemonade!"}
{"text":"YESSSSS it's so hard to enjoy the greatness that is In N Out when you don't live on the west coast! Thankfully there is one in Vegas so I don't have to make the entire trek out to Cali. Good old standard In N Out, can't complain. The place can be incredibly hectic unless you're there at 2AM (done that) so be ready to get jostled around. Worth it, though, to be able to enjoy a good burger and delicious fries in the wonderful Vegas sun."}
{"text":"Not the world's best burger but by fat the best run burger place ever.  The food is better than most other fast food places but the staff is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Long line in the drive thru (weekend) but worth the wait! I ordered through an employee standing in the drive thru, with a tablet in hand. Very friendly, very professional! Quality of food and service is outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"I've never had bad anything at any In-N-Out, until I came here. Soda was contaminated which I've never thought could be possible and the fries looked good but discovered it was a brown thick oil on them which I'm no expert but tells me maybe the fryer hasn't been cleaned or the oil hasn't been changed out. I hate to give any poor review, but people can get really sick if they eat here."}
{"text":"After a year I made it back to Phoenix. The food here was better than the last time I visited. The fries were really good as well was the chocolate milkshake. It's a great place to eat for fast food."}
{"text":"So there is only one thing that stops me from being a Vegan- Wait for it, Yelp, you guessed it- hamburgers. Ok, maybe not just one thing but burgers are certainly high up there on the list. Love me a good burger. Sorry cows. Yes I do love animals but my willpower fails me when it comes to a great juicy meat patty. But I digress. In regards to INOB Frankly, everyone raves about this place and I never got it. There are so many better hamburgers in town.  All the times I went here did not leave a memorable impression in my brain, good or bad. sooooooooo, when I saw they opened one more centrally located I decided to go again with the soul purpose of writing a review. (Hmmmm that's a switch for foodie Mary here who usually only goes to eat first and write second)     INOB is known for using real meat and not processed patty garbage- so give them a check on the positive. ( And they might be one of the few fast food restaurants that uses real food) In N Out is know for their wonderful hiring procedures and employee and employer relations. (gotta love that in today's day and age) - another check- INOB burgers cost under 5 bucks and a little bit over for a combo- WOWZA checkmate! (Mary does not like paying 10- 15 dollars for a good hamburger. She will, haha, but doesn't like to)     Ok, so now onto the negative-( Sigh, I know but I have to share)  Crazy busy places make me nervous and messes up the shopping center parking lot when I need to got to Michael's- check minus for almost getting hit five times getting there today.  French Fries-ewhhhhh! Why were they cold if they serve them fresh? I know I am very picky about temperature and fries.I don't eat fries to much anymore so I want them to be really good when I indulge because I hate to throw them out and waste food and money. They just aren't that good here- check minus.     And now onto the golden reason I liked today's visit the best----- It was the customer service!( big roar in the background inserted here)  Jeepers Kreepers INOB staff members can ya keep the smileage down please? Do you have to be so nice? LOL! I swear they send the staff to happy, friendly, excellent customer service college. They are all very nice and give service with a smile. Eye contact and everything. (Makes the longer wait a little but more manageable)  It is amazing how they beat out the others by a mile in this dept. Even better than some fancy restaurants.     So in conclusion, is INOB the best burger in town- no far from it. Is it good- yes. Is it the best burger for fast food under 15 bucks -HMMMMMMM, well you decide. I'll never tell. But to tell you my secret It is in my two top favorites. You will have to guess which one I like more. I do admit my favorite though comes nowhere close in the Customer Service dept and the Phoenix locations can't match the back east versions. So with that said many of my Westerner Peeps might end up picking INOB as their first choice. So, enjoy and be happy there is finally one more centrally located. And from the line out the door I think it is about time.   PS- you might want to tell them to hold the onions though. Wehhhh 6 hours later and my breath is still reliving the experience."}
{"text":"Typical In N Out, the lines are long during peak hours, but not as bad as some other locations. Service is friendly per usual and special orders are welcome. I'm one of the weird ones that prefers hamburgers to cheeseburgers and grilled onions are a must.   Going before or after peak hours is optimal."}
{"text":"This is one of the more out of the way In-N-Out locations.   Their lines are almost always long, but they are efficient and get the line going quickly. The food is solid and I'll come to this location ahead of most others out of convenience."}
{"text":"This is a solid In n Out location. They are always busy at lunch, like most other In n Out's so keep that in mind if you're in a rush. I always order the hamburger combo with grilled onions and they deliver it just as I request."}
{"text":"This is the busiest In N Out location I have ever seen. It's easy to understand why because of its proximity to the strip and easy accessibility to the freeway for tourists and locals alike.   Because it's so busy, I do try to avoid this location as often as I can, but I was craving In N Out and this was the closest location, so we made the exception.   Despite how busy they were, they have the whole process down pat. The line goes relatively quickly and the service is as great as any other location."}
{"text":"Was expecting more unfortunately because of all the hype people put into it. None the less, it was good fast food. Service was great, but it was hard to find a spot to sit inside, but I guess that's good for business having too many people."}
{"text":"I first ate at In & Out when I was in Las Vegas several years ago. Then a few years ago they moved to Arizona and at a location not far from where I live in Peoria. The attraction for me was the ability to get a burger wrapped in lettuce. (Protein Style) If you know the key words you can get your burger cooked many ways that are not published on the menu. I could never quite understand the crowd of people coming there to eat. Lined up out the door and a line of cars around the place with someone out side taking orders. It is just a hamburger nothing exceptional. They do have good fries. Better than most.  Today I had spent 3 hours installing cabinet doors at my in-laws house. Was not supposed to take this much time but it seems to go that way at times. Well I worked way past lunch and was hungry. In & Out was on the way home. Really should of driven a couple of miles out of the way and gone to Rocket Burger.  Any way I got what I always get a single cheese burger protein style a order of fries and a ice tea. Now I don't eat there very often but when I took my first bite and looked at the burger I noticed it was only about 3/16 of an inch thick. It could of even been thinner. I went WOW where is the beef.(Sorry for using an over used term.) This was quite a bit thinner than I can rememberer. I know, I know, I know, if they had been that thin in the past I surely would of noticed. It was just a little thicker than peanut butter spread on a piece of toast. Guess I can blame it on the economy. Rocket Burger is at least 2 to 3 times thicker. Much better value.  If you go to In & Out, look at the patty.   This review is meant to inform. Not to be negative. Hopefully you do not take it as being negative.  In & Out is always clean, the people friendly and cheerful, the food was good tasting.  The reason for the 2 stars and not 3 was value. The people at the restaurant did everything right.  Happy eating!"}
{"text":"You can't go West without a stop at this burger haven.  I can't add much else to what other Yelpers have said.  I like that they slice and dice the potatoes for the fries right there before your eyes.  It's an exceptionally good burger, the double is a meal.  Even at 11am on a Monday this place was buzzing!"}
{"text":"I love how I literally live 400 feet away from In - N - Out! It is the best thing ever being able to walk there from your doorsteps. Like always the place is always clean and neat. Drive through can be a wait depending on the time of the day. Usually around 3pm there is barely any cars in line. Ordering in restaurant is always quite fast. I love their cheese burgers and animal fries. Fries light well is the best way to have their fries! However, I am the type of person that likes soggy fries and crispy fries so I do not mind any kind!"}
{"text":"Being from California, I've been going to In-N-Out for years.  Their employees are always the best fast food employees in the business.  The reason?  My guess is they get the best because they pay nearly 40% more than other fast food joints (on average)!    The secret menu and super secret menu make ordering more fun.  I always order hot peppers with my food and shhh... you can order some, too.  I also have enjoyed fries made crispy and unsalted and I have also ordered my fries animal style.  The biggest burger you can get now is a 4 x 4, but I remember back in the day someone ordering an 8 x 8 and even hearing of someone even getting a 20 x 20.  This particular location has always had exceptionally cheerful employees.    The orientation of the building to the parking lot makes it hard to get to the drive thru during busy times.  Of course, this is a problem with a lot of In-N-Out restaurants.  The only other comment I have is that I hate ketchup dispensers and always order the packets.  On my last visit I found a hair stuck to the spout of the dispenser.  It's just gross to see a hair just waving at you when you're pumping out your condiments.  In-N-Out may not be the best burger, but it is definitely leagues ahead of most of the other chains."}
{"text":"Always a MUST when we come into Phoenix and when we are leaving. Never disappoints."}
{"text":"The best burgers of all chainburgers!  Fresh, juicy burgers at a ral low price. A double-double with fries and a softdrink is only 6,25 $.  Order it \"animal style\" to get it grilled with a layer of mustard and served with  grilled onion and extra sauce. Delicious every time!"}
{"text":"It's In-N-Out....simple menu, fresh food, and very tasty might I add. Their fries aren't my favorite but their burgers and shakes definitely make up for it. I really don't understand how the lines are always so long and take forever to go through. Prices aren't ridiculous and the workers are pretty swell too."}
{"text":"I love In N Out burgers! Their lettuce wrap burger is also soooo good and the prices are amazing! You can't get burgers that taste this good for that price on the east coast! A burger that good here costs at least $8 here. Please open stores on the east coast! I'm not a huge fan of the fries, but I know some people that are. They have a \"secret menu\" that's not really a secret but it's still cool since it's not on the menu. Get the animal style burger! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Quality-made to order food.  Can't go wrong with a double-double.  This shop can get crowded when a tour bus stops, but the staff rocks the counter and grills to get it done."}
{"text":"Love this location and so close to our house.   Huge dining area and always clean plus the drive thru is quick and efficient.   Come for the burgers which are so inexpensive and you also have to get the fresh cut fries.   The double double burger is huge and throw on some onions and you have one awesome burger.   If you are lucky while in the drive thru you may see them actually cutting the fries.   The service is always top notch and the food comes out quickly.   Got to hand it to them the food is extremely fresh and always tasty and juicy.  I remember when they first opened the drive thru line was about 30-40 minutes long so I dropped my wife at Nordstrom Rack, the kids were small at the time and asleep so I went thru the drive thru in about 45 minutes so my wife got to shop the kids got a good nap and my stomach was happy."}
{"text":"I drove up to the order from the box and waited and tried to order for a few minutes but no one answered.  I ended up driving up and there was one car in front of me.  Even with virtually no line it took 15 minutes to get my food.  They were far more focused on pre-closing which was evident by the lack of employees in the kitchen and on registers as compared to cleaning.    The service was sub-par to say the least."}
{"text":"The food is always great however the service has a lot to be desired. in the Drive-Thru it took me about 4 or 5 times to repeat my order and then finally when I got through the drive-thru they handed me a box and didn't offer bag. they never asked if I wanted to eat in the car or take it to go so I was forced to drive home with a box of food.  I did ask about the bag and they said sorry but then they went on to assist the next customer. Clearly they are not the brightest beads on the Rosary"}
{"text":"Great customer service and great food. It's one of the cleanest and surprisingly non-crowded in-n-outs I've been to. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The best and consistent fast food burger you can get. All they serve is burgers, fries cut fresh in front of you and excellent shakes. The staff are always very friendly. I have become a vegetarian and when i cheat a couple times a year, the meat i will eat will be a IN-N Out Burger. That is all i will miss not eating meat."}
{"text":"How can you make freshly cut fries taste frozen? I don't know, but In-n-Out managed to find a way. They're completely bland... the insides are not thoroughly cooked.... and well, I'd take ANY chain's fries over theirs!  But but but, the animal style burger was very good. And the price tag was even better. We were completely sticker-shocked after spending a few days in Vegas. Side note here but if you ever wander up and down the strip, take note how much a cup of coffee costs at Starbucks. Outside the casinos: $1.40. Inside the casinos: $2.80+ Soo... how can a burger cost $2??? Which, of course, just made me even more angry that night when I paid $46 for the Wynn buffet...  I would definitely recommend getting the burger animal-style... bf likes his burgers \"classic\" and he got screweddd. what a sucker. The difference lies in the pickles, the caramelized onions, and the sauce. He got... I don't even remember what was in it besides tomato, lettuce, and cheese because I took a bite and went \"HA!\" then continued eating mine.  Still, West Coasters need to stop prancing about In-n-Out like it's the queen of freaking Sheba. One friend (from California, mind you) claimed the burgers in the LV joint weren't as good as the ones from California. For that, I call his big fat bluff. But I could go for a double double animal-style right now...  I really was just referring to the burger, guys."}
{"text":"Amazing and fresh as always and everybody already knows that. PINK LEMONADE IS AMAZING!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Location: it is located by the San Tan mall. The parking was crowded due to holiday season. We were going to find a parking and dine in, but we've decided to take it to go since it was completely packed with no available parking space.   Service: staffs were friendly. They are the reason I am giving this place a 2 stars  Food: How many stars should I rate this place when my stomach got sick for a few hours after eating their food? The French fries were greasy and the animal style regular burger was falling apart. I also ordered a root beer soda and it was water down. I used to love in-and-out burger until now.   Rating: I will try a different location but will probably skip this one."}
{"text":"Workers at the drive thru are friendly. My animal style burger was absolutely delicious. This is my favorite place to be when I want to get a burger."}
{"text":"What is nice about Inn and out is that it is fast. Despite ordering different burgers (without tomatoes, extra pickles) they got it all correct and quickly."}
{"text":"Mediocre burger and fries that are below average. Second visit to an In-N-Out Burger and no reason to return. Too many other great burger options that have way better fries. Service was good and the place was packed but I think Five Guys is waaaay better. Maybe its almost a Coke vs. Pepsi, Mac vs. Windows thing :-)"}
{"text":"Come on, now. Everyone knows that when you come to the west coast and there's an In-N-Out, you've got to go. There's not much I can say to contribute to this joint because everyone already knows about In-N-Out's consistent quality and reasonable prices, but let me reiterate and say that it was delicious! The food isn't the best (Shake Shack has better burgers and fries, and McDonalds has the GOAT fries) but for the price and service, there's a reason the restaurant is a cultural icon. Three of us ordered a double double, two regular burgers, and two orders of fries. Tasty!"}
{"text":"I am very glad they don't have In N Outs in Chicago; that would be dangerous! Loved my animal style burger and my strawberry shake!"}
{"text":"Gotta love In-N-Out for a cheep, fast good meal.  The staff is awesome and the place is clean"}
{"text":"The food is good for fast food, but I would like to share my experience about their customer service, which I found to be fantastic. The folks behind the counter are obviously well trained, professional at all times, and well, bright in smile. On Christmas Eve's eve, I went to the store in Paradise Valley, AZ, picked up some food and one of their quality, reasonably priced logo T-shirts for my spouse. I bought too large of a size we learned after he tried it on over another T-shirt. I called their 800 number to see if it could be exchanged at the Scottsdale store nearer our home. The young man on the phone bent over backwards in his efforts to help us accomplish the exchange. He called the Scottsdale store, learned they had the size shirt we desired, placed it on hold for us, and provided the name of manager there who would make the exchange. The exchange was quick, easy, and facilitated by the named smiling manager, Shanda. Bravo In-and-Out! Now that is service."}
{"text":"I don't think anyone has really ever said anything bad about an In-N-Out.  Being from California I grew up on them and they never disappoint.  One of the few chains to where I can always expect high quality food and taste. This location is always busy, but it never seems to take me more than 5-10 min from the line to get my order. To me, once it goes over 10 min in line that is when I knock the In-N-Out location, but this location if busy will have someone standing out taking your order to speed up the process."}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets when you're craving some good old fashioned burgers and fries.  Always packed both inside and at the drive-thru, but the workers are always super friendly and the food is always consistently good, fast to come out and perfectly assembled.  Burgers are amazing, fries are delicious (and definitely fresh cut), and milkshakes are da bomb! You also can't beat the prices!!!  Definitely our go-to burger joint!  I don't think I'll ever be able to live in a town that doesn't have an In-N-Out ever again!  It's that serious."}
{"text":"The meat is still really tasty. But the buns have been really dry the last couple of months it's not soft or fresh they brake really easy smh."}
{"text":"Ordered total of 4 meals threw the drive thru. Got home after a long day of work ready to eat and started taking the food out my bags and there was a burger missing . Called and has to go back since my girlfriends burger was missing. They told me over phone I could either have a whole meal sent to me or just go to store to pick up burger . I went to pick up burger wasted 40 extra minutes of my life for them to just give me burger didn't even offer to make it right by at least getting me extra fries . I really don't appreciate their service . I work in the customer service industry as a supervisor and I know I make it right by giving my customer extra things when I know we mest it up . I wouldn't be going back to this in out they should learn to check orders before giving em out"}
{"text":"What can I say, California staple that is a pretty good burger but is it worth the 30 min wait? I don't think so but many do. Having grew up in Cali these are ok burgers. Gotta love how they have marketed themselves. Versus a Burgerville or 5 Guys..not that good. Still not a fan of the fries but I know many are.  No matter what, I will always eat at an In-N-Out if I get a chance, gotta support my Cali roots. Be prepared for a line, have a beer in hand at this location."}
{"text":"Delicious but SO slow. Took me 25 minutes to get through the drive thru on a weekday."}
{"text":"I went to a concert at the Brooklyn Bowl and of course needed a bite after all that alcohol. Thank goodness for In-N-Out being right there. Don't be deterred by the long line. The staff there are very efficient. Got my order spot on and way faster than I had thought it would be. I almost didn't go in bc of the long line but glad I did. Very satisfied with this location."}
{"text":"I was a little worried that a restaurant off the Strip would be chaotic, but In-N-Out was a critical stop. Luckily, we were pleasantly surprised, and this spot was quite efficient and handled the crowds well.   Not only was the food spot on - delicious tasting and traditionally priced - but this location was also great for people watching. If you catch my drift.   Animal style all the way, my friends."}
{"text":"If I am hungry, and I mean really hungry, that is the kind of hungry where not just any food will do but you want to make sure to go someplace where you are going to like the food.  You are famished and you don't want to risk a new place that may or may not feed that hunger demon who will play havoc with your insides les you appease his demands, at that point you are going to go here In'N'Out.  It was because of Yelp that I found my nearest In N Out location. I love that app.  It directed me here and I was in burger heaven.  Everything taste so good at this place.  There isn't a single complaint I ever have upon leaving, only that I wish I had more room to consume more.  A little gluttinous perhaps, but I dream of Double Doubles."}
{"text":"Always the best place to eat when your hungry and don't know where to go. Always the best. A DOUBLE DOUBLE WITH CHEESE, extra sauce and lots of napkins..."}
{"text":"its funny how the locations vary . here in tucson, the best on is at kolb and bw. but the one thing is the bun, its too little to hold the stuff.nonethe less i love it and while burger king has better buns  the two should share ideas and then both would be perfect."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD!  I HEARD ALL THE RUMORS ABOUT HOW WONDERFUL BUT HAD NOOOOO IDEA UNTIL I TRIED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME!!   I had to use caps to discuss my love for In-N-Out burger.  I tried it for the first time - double animal style with fries and chocolate shake - I went for it...cut out he bada bing and just had the BOOM!   I was so nervous ordering but the lad was so kind and cute and probably like 13 1/2 years old.   I'm in love.  I really am.    I would get on a plane tomorrow again just to fly to get In-N-Out."}
{"text":"This is my go to for fast food even if the line is super long inside and outside in the drive thru. I like how you can customize your order into your preference and their spread is delicious on the burger and fries.   The drives they line was pretty long today and took almost 20 minutes to get through. I customized my order so maybe that's why it was a bit of a wait. I chose a number two with grilled onions, chopped peppers, and no tomatoes. I also ordered the fries well done with a lemonade to drink.   This time my fried came out as ordered and I was able to get two packets of spread to put on my fried instead of ketchup. The service overall was good and once you get to the windows to pay and get your food it's actually quick."}
{"text":"Dude have you been to In-N-Out yet?? Why not? These guys know what they're doing. SUPER simple menu, basically just burgers and fries. But burgers that are how you would make them at home. Nice full juicy slices of tomato, whole rings of onion, REAL lettuce leaves. Absolutely delicious. If you want some extra flavor, ask for your fries \"animal style\" (melted cheese, thousand island and onions on top.) it's crazy good. I also got a chocolate strawberry milkshake. So thick and creamy. I can't wait to go back!"}
