{"text":"This place was the bomb good food the ramen was hot and the soju was strong and hit the spot. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Since coming to AZ we have been looking for a place with good Korean food.  Being part Korean and always being around authentic food makes that an even more difficult task for me.  I stumbled across this place and will definitely be coming back regularly! I had the pork belly salad and my hubby had the fried chicken (yangnyeom)--delicious! Of course we paired it with Hite and makkeoli :)  The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed and a great place to just chill, eat good Korean food and have a few drinks.  Looking forward to the watermelon soju bowl next time!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place with my girl. The orange chicken tasted like it was cooked yesterday, and the zucchini tasted slightly rotten. We walked out, leaving a full dish of overpriced ($16) orange chicken. Had high hopes for this place. Might go grab a burger from McDonald now because it tastes better."}
{"text":"The bulgogi nacho fries were pretty good! I think if they were more generous with the bulgogi it would even better. It was kind of just sprinkled on the top. But other than that the portion size and taste was on point!"}
{"text":"Woah this place was REALLY GOOD! I enjoyed the ambience. It was super relaxing with my fam. Would totally come with friends too. Food was scrumptious too ^_^ yay! Oh! Also the service was super on top of everything I was really impressed."}
{"text":"Great food. Good service. Nice place to chill with with friends. The music is upbeat and the bathroom is clean."}
{"text":"So amazing!! Service is great and the people are so friendly and on top of it! The food is incredible!!"}
{"text":"It's hard to write this review. I really want to endorse and talk it up. The food is decent-good. It has great ideas for their menu. The flavor sometimes lack. I LOVE their steamed egg. I can't get enough of it. Their service is often slow. Please know it's not because they are lazy or just don't care. It's because they are under staffed. I feel if there were more structure and a few more people. It would run so smoothly. The decor.... well everything is black. Feels dingy, college-y. Granted it's surrounded by college students. But you shouldn't be like this. In my opinion. Create an atmosphere that isn't shrouded in black. I really do enjoy this place but it's mainly because I am distracted by the company that I go with here. They've gotten to know the staff and they make it interesting and fun. The inconsistencies I'm sure will iron out in time and I can only assume so will the color scheme and atmosphere . I look forward to seeing this."}
{"text":"Had it for the first time yesterday. Ordered the fire chicken with mozzarella cheese yum. Really delicious and spicy. Only con is that 25% of the chicken had cheese on it and did not look like the other pictures I saw. I guessed they just decided to skimp on it. Service was good. Overall would still give it a 4"}
{"text":"Korean chicken, fries, and Ramen.  20 oz Kloud beer and K-pop in the background.  Yummy Korean bar food."}
{"text":"The service here is amazing! The waitresses here are so accommodating. The food, however, was just okay. I ordered the salt and pepper shrimp, spicy squid, and sea food pancake. The seafood pancake dough was a little soggy, like it wasn't fully cooked, but there was a lot of seafood on it. The spicy squid was a bit spicy but the flavor was good; mostly cabbages, carrots, and mushrooms though. The squid was sparse. The salt and pepper shrimp was also a little soggy and didn't really taste like salt and pepper shrimp. It was just lightly fried. Overall, this place was okay in terms of the food, but I'm giving it a four stars because the service was good."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Nice music if u into Kpop haha. I tried seafood pancake and spicy pork both are super good. Strongly recommended tho!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here. The service was great. Any questions we had about the menu or drinks our server was more than happy to answer. Would recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Real cool eatery. Very low key and good place to get Korean bar food (whatever that may be.) Fair warning they do not serve traditional Kimchee so if you're looking for that you will be disappointed. Nice, attentive and patient staff."}
{"text":"This place is fire, we ordered yogurt soju, bulgogi, and spicy pork. The service was nice and our food had large portions to them. We came here from Los Angeles to visit some friends and decided to check out some local Asian food. This place is comparable to authentic Korean food that you would find in L.A. if you're super into Asian food or would like to try it this is a great place to start."}
{"text":"This place has the best fire chicken ever!! Add the $2.50 steamed rice and that'll be a great meal. Their food is pretty great, though are slightly pricier than other Korean places. It's also nice place to hang out with friends late at night where other stores close before 10. I'm excited to try the watermelon soju."}
{"text":"If you're looking through the menu and unsure what to get-get the soy garlic chicken. Honestly the best popcorn chicken I've ever had, also got the kimchi fried rice which was good as well and they're probably meant to be shared between two people or among friends since they're big portions. Will probably be back to try other items off their menu."}
{"text":"Bulgogi fries were delicious! Fries were crispy and just the right amount of toppings. The fire chicken was spicy but to die for! Service was great and the place opened late! Sadly, they didn't have the watermelon soju since it wasn't in season, but their peach soju from the bottle was a good substitution."}
{"text":"We went to Drunken Tiger for the first time last week. The food was tasty.  Great atmosphere and patio service. The only reason we gave 4 instead of 5 stars was the server was alone and we had to walk up to find her for a few things. She was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Great Korean fusion. Decent prices. Great for night time snackers. K-pop on the radio and TVs made for a good environment. Friendly staff and right near the lakeside."}
{"text":"Finally a great Korean bar in Arizona! The ambience feels like I'm in k-town in LA.   The food is great and the drink specials are excellent. I love coming here with friends. We always order the Korean fried chicken and steamed egg to go with soju/beer. The owner is super friendly too!  Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Stay away from this place! Came here and asked for a table and the girl in the front said there were no tables. She offered no wait list. She just said there are no tables. I stood there looking at a 12 seat hightop with dirty dishes laying on the table. I said what about that table and she ignored me. This is no way to run a business. Train your employees and make them learn customer service. In the crowded restaurant business there are millions of other options. Go somewhere else if you want to be treated like a human."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times, the food is absolutely wonderful! If youre not too crazy to try new things the seafood pancake and Sea snail salad are definitely some of my favorites ^^ you absolutely can not go wrong with the bulgogi fries as well. Also one of the best places in town to get soju and beer at a reasonable price. Definitely a good atmosphere to go and kick it with friends, can't wait to go back !"}
{"text":"Wow.... just wow. I am dreaming of the day I get to return to eat at this place again. The food here is delicious. I can't believe I've waited this long to try it out but boy does it not disappoint.   We got 3 things to try. Padak ( popcorn chicken with green onions ), toebokki , and fire corn cheese.  The portions here are HUGE so remember to bring a friend to share with. Everything we've ordered tasted amazing and we loved every single bite.   There is definitely more things on the menu I want to try so I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a nice place to visit at night for authentic food, nice drinks, and a great atmosphere. Usually it's impossible to have all three, but Drunken Tiger definitely fits the bill. I'll definitely be visiting again and again!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this restaurant as probably the best authentic Korean food in Arizona. WOW HE WAS RIGHT! This place rocks! Iv never been a huge fan of Korean food till now. The owner chef has done amazing with this authentic street style Korean food. All the food came out fresh and hot, flavorful and satisfying! Every dish is unique in its own right! We started off with the fried octopus, and chicken gizzards which was amazing! We then had the kimchi fried rice, shredded beef and pineapple fried rice! Finished with fresh watermelon! Make sure you try the bar, they have a full Korean bar nothing seen in AZ! Food is so good it is meant to be eaten while getting drunk!"}
{"text":"We went last Friday and they only have one waiter.  We ordered the grilled chicken which didn't even looked like it was grilled and they didn't even bring any kimchi.  We liked the seafood pancake.  Unless it is a common practice, they automatically charge an 18% service charge for a party of 4, my wife and I and my two kids.  Never go here again.  Great alternative would be Gogi or Hodori."}
{"text":"I have an unhealthy obsession with their yang nyam chicken. The flavor for both the regular and the soy garlic is pretty good. Sometimes the meat itself can be a bit dry but overall it's satisfying.   Their menu mainly consists of Korean bar food. Aside from the yang nyam, I've only had the bulgogi fries. It's worth trying out but it's nothing to get too excited for. Drinks wise - get the yoju (yogurt soju). Their flavored soju can be a watered down, but it does the job if you're pregaming.  Service is not bad but somewhat understaffed. Parking lot has a decent amount of space. Overall good place to try out."}
{"text":"Love this place for the late night eatz. Very reminiscent of the late night spots out in Ktown in LA. The wait staff and owner are very cool and laid back. I recommend you check this place out at least once for their late night menu. This place has become a late night eating spot for me and my friends on at least one night on the weekends for the past month."}
{"text":"Service was excellent on a busy Friday night, such a fun place to come together with friends over some delicious Korean bbq beef and soju! Beware the fire chicken, its fire is no joke, but delicious nonetheless! Will definitely be coming again!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Drunken Tiger!! I honestly think I come here every weekend because it's a fun place to drink and eat bar food. I lived in Korea for a year and this place is the closest thing I've found to the Korean style \" \" or bar. Pro Tip: Ask for the Kimchi Animal Style Fries!! It's on the secret menu and it is the BEST THING EVER."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is dope af. The bulgogi fries are literally fire. The store owner is always coming out and greeting us being friendly. The vibe is super cool. Love that they have a karaoke machine. My buddies and I go here all the time just for the fries."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place? Really good food, good drinks, great atmosphere. I found this little gem a couple months ago and I come here at least once a week and I live in Glendale. The staff is always nice and attentive (if they are busy they will let you know and apologize ahead of time for the wait). My staples are the corn cheese (which is like crack I can't stop eating it) and the Korean Fried Chicken pre-tossed, the bao are very good as well the bread is very sweet and fluffy and the pork belly is cooked perfectly to accompany it. This is a good place to have some drinks and enjoy good food with friends. One of the better Korean places in town."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight at this new spot for Korean barbecue/bar food. our server tonight was Kelvin. And he was very helpful explaining the menu and going over different options for us we ended up ordering the two appetizers and two dinners that I posted pictures off and they were all delicious.   I think I like the spicy pork better than the chicken but my husband liked the chicken better than the pork that he ordered. so for what it's worth we had a great dinner.  Again I think it's so clever to take something like rice cakes deep fry it, then pan sauté it with hot sauce and have it coming out like something that looks like chicken but it's not chicken and it was still super Good.  We will definitely come back to this place!"}
{"text":"Had my birthday drinks here because DUH candy on top of watermelon soju inside a watermelon??? Yes.  If you check in and review on Yelp, you get 15% off your bill. That is precisely what I am doing now.  I shared the watermelon soju with the boyfriend and got pretty buzzed, but boyfriend didn't feel anything. Apparantly there's one entire bottle of soju in the \"bowl\" according to the waiter. My boyfriend says next time we come to request they double the amount of soju.  Definitely the closest thing you can get in Arizona that compares to Koreatown in Los Angeles. I mean, obviously it's nothing like actual Ktown but it's OK.  The watermelon soju comes with a baggie of Poprocks. Also, I asked for a cup of extra Fruity Pebbles and it was not a problem at all.  Great place for my birthday drink! If any girlfriends come to visit me in Arizona (ha.. ha... haaa) then I'll definitely bring them here.  Although, I purposely ate dinner before coming here because the food is really freaking expensive."}
{"text":"The food is great.  Staff is awesome.  Feels like LA ktown.  The steam egg took me back to my childhood."}
{"text":"Korean bbq at the Drunken tiger is a drunken tiger upper cut to my wallet!  First off this place is a bar, wouldn't say kid friendly by any means, they ask you to request water refills when they can just ask if you would like more water, what a conundrum?  The pot stickers were great, most times they are boiled, these were pan fried and crispy, the fire chicken was to hot and to be honest I didn't enjoy it at all.  The star of the show was the Korean red wings, these were so flavorful sweet with a hint spicy, great taste.  Last was the galbi spare ribs, $20 they were good, I don't think it was worth $20 but it was worth trying once.  This seems like a good place to hang and get food with friends after getting drunk somewhere else.  Probably won't be going back here but the wings were awesome!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner and karaoke with a friend. Atmosphere.....if you can really call it that was \"place going out of business chic. Menu was incredibly odd. Frenc fries, bulgogi meat Velveeta and jalapenos. Preston \"fusion\" lol. Tried the watermelon soju. Had lovely stomach acebth next day. Karoke was also a joke. Gave it a shot. Will not return."}
{"text":"Mozzarella fries, Parmesan garlic and Korean fire chicken wings was the decision we made tonight.  The wings were different than my typical choices at other restaurants but very good in a different way.  The mozzarella fries were a switch for me and I enjoyed them.  We live right down the street and always notice the packed house in the evenings, but never have stopped in.  Tonight we did, and was overall pleasantly surprised.  This was a Wednesday night around 6:00pm and place was not crowded at all.  We were immediately greeted by some friendly staff and given our pick of seating.  I like to sit by TV's with good viewing position so this is exactly what we did.  The TV's caught my attention for the music videos from Korea playing.  The videos didn't match the music coming from the speakers which made it funnier to me.  I thought MTV got sexually suggestive over the years, but these Koreans made me blush.  I have no idea what they were singing about, but by the body movements I had a good idea.  I think the \"Gangnam Style\" singer PSY dominated most of the videos.  This guy cracks me up and he can dance better than MC Hammer.  My wife kindly inquired about the karaoke we've read so much about and I believe the waitress was going to set up and give us a play list to choose from if we were interested in.  I kindly told my wife and waitress no thanks, I only sing to packed houses.  So yes, we will be coming back on a late weekend night so I can sing an ass of myself.  Overall the entire staff was friendly, place is not big at all and atmosphere was mellow while we ate.  The menu is pretty basic and I left thinking what a great place to come cure a hangover with all the fried food.  We will be frequenting more often, especially on weekend nights."}
{"text":"Finally I've been wanting to try this place for the longest time and I'm glad I did. Came in and the restaurant was very modern. It's a great place for college students and teenagers. The menu is very Korean-Americanize. It was simple and that what I like is a simple menu! We order the Korean Red Chicken Wings and it has the best sauce over it! There corn cheese isn't anything special but it does taste very good. The environment feels refreshing and new. I will definitely be back. My only problem was the severs was super nice but very lacking. They were not attentive at all. But everything else was great!"}
{"text":"I've already been here twice within this past week and I can say that I'm already a big fan of the place. The servers here are not only quick with service, but they are also very friendly and personable with their customers. The first night I went here I had the Bulgogi Nacho Fries. It's basically like carne asada fries, but with a Korean twist on it since they are adding bulgogi meat instead of carne asada. Only thing they can do to improve it would be to add a bit more bulgogi. The second night I had the Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) and it was so delicious!! I recommend pairing it with soju or beer. All in all, I'll definitely be coming back and I'll be bringing more friends with me!!~"}
{"text":"Great for late night eats, nice selection of authentic Korean food and soju with different flavors! Thanks Intizar for such awesome service!"}
{"text":"We went to here celebrate a birthday occasion and have fun with karaoke.  The food was good although the service was mediocre. We enjoyed the atmosphere and music but when came time for karaoke. We were told they only allowed half hour of karaoke at time. Obviously our night of celebrations were disrupted  when we had to wait thirty minutes before we can Karaoke. We ended our night disappointed due to some awkward rule that's place by management. My only question is \"has anyone ever gone a to karaoke place where it limits karaoke singing to 30 minutes and wait 30\"?"}
{"text":"Went with a few friends. The food is good! We had fun singing Karaoke, and Calvin our waiter was very nice! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the fried \"popcorn\" chicken and it was bomb with the red sauce. Watermelon soju was also good. A little pricy though."}
{"text":"Drinks. Food. Karaoke. Fun. This is how I would describe my first visit to this establishment. The food is Korean-themed, with more introductory options for the less experienced. The drink menu runs a straight line through beer and soju-based drinks. There is a chalk board of speciality items to enjoy, such as a half-watermelon with soju topped with fruity pebbles and pop rocks. Delicious! The fried chicken and the corn cheese (it is exactly what it sounds like) is a must! The staff is very lively, happy and fun. Karaoke options include Korean, Japanese, English, Indonesian, Russian, top 50, and many more! I highly recommend it, especially if you are looking for a great karaoke spot."}
{"text":"Surprise! Surprise! Karaoke right here and now. Don't fret over the $22  Watermelon soju. Its worth all the crazy Fruity Pebbles and Pop Rock candy on top"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat. 2nd time around and they keep up with great food and great customer service. Definitely recommended"}
{"text":"Hands down the best meal we have had in a long time!  We shared the cream corn, bulgogi, and salt and pepper shrimp.  Needless to say we stuffed ourselves to the fullest.  I kept looking across the table and saying, \"how are you still eating!\"  We also tried a green apple Good Day which was so smooth and sweet; you could easily get lit AF drinking that!  I think we may actually go back tonight just to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food was awesome, drinks were awesome, and the service was good too. Definitely a new hangout spot with my friends."}
{"text":"They have a watermelon soju with fresh fruity pebbles cereal and pop rocks it's more of a bar than a restaurant"}
{"text":"I had a lovely time eating chicken wings and cheese sticks here.  The Korean BBQ is a little too sweet for my taste but definitely my hub's type.  I did however enjoyed the garlic Parmesan wings.  I enjoyed watching the dancing in the Korean music videos played here.  It sounds a lot like our R&B and rap music with Korean performers.  FYI, Karaoke is free here as long as you spend a minimum of $10 for dinner/lunch.   This is a definitely a place I would like to visit on a weekend night!  The parking lot here seems packed every evening."}
{"text":"Such a fun place! I loved the corn cheese and Korean chicken, they have cool drinks too. I had the watermelon soju, it a lot for just one person lol I also LOVED the music playlist."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. I heard a lot of my friends come here for the Bulgogi fries so I wanted to try. It's big enough to probably feed 2-3 people which is a plus. Although it's pretty expensive. The fries were $16.99. They have Tteokokki which is a Korean noodle dish that you can add different stuff like cheese, egg, noodles, and etc. The price for that was ($10.99) Koreans generally have there signature spicy red sauce so it was on a lot of my friends meals such as my friends Korean Fried Chicken and Kimchi Friend Rice. For myself I got Takoyaki which are ball shaped snack that has tempura and octopus. It was okay the price for that was $6.99. It's a cute restaurant with a good environment like karaoke. I would only go for the Bulgogi Fries honestly."}
{"text":"They have Korean style pub food you can't really get around here. If you want to pretend you're in k-town and enjoy some soju then this place is it! Open karaoke can get a little annoying and the lights at the table are a little bright but all in all a good time!"}
{"text":"Every visit to this establishment is enjoyable. They have great staff that don't rudely correct me when I butcher the names of the menu items. Lol Every time my friends and I leave this place we are always excited for our next dinner and drinks. My favorite things to order are Korean fried chicken, seafood pancake (huge), and bulgogi. My favorite drinks are a pitcher of pineapple soju and the subak soju(crowd pleaser). I still have yet to try the silk worm soup, I'll try it soon!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, clean, nice atmosphere.  Authentic Asian bar/food and dining.  Sake bombers are very good!. It's a Korean version of sake called Soju which is a lot smoother.  Karaoke and smoking outside."}
{"text":"As a huge fan of the LA Korea Town bar scene Drunken Tiger is a much needed spot here in Phoenix. Traditional Korean bar food mixed with modern day fusion choices, and full stock of Korean drink choice, DT has become my go to spot for my Ktown fix. Although nothing can replace ktown this is definitely a close second."}
{"text":"I'm from LA and this is the closest food that I can find over here that reminds me of LA foods. DELICIOUS 10/10"}
{"text":"Over priced, over rated... and if the kitchen is as clean as this place there are even more issues to be had."}
{"text":"The quality of the food was sub par. We got the nachos, spicy pork, and the spicy sea snail salad. The snails were very tough, chewy and tasted old and freezer burned. The spicy pork was not fresh either, with most of the pork being only fat. This was really surprising given the good reviews. I would never eat this food again. The prices are pretty high considering the quality and lack of freshness."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were cruising the town in search of a new restaurant when Yelp led us to this place. We love Asian food and sports bars, so Drunken Tiger did not disappoint. We consumed lots of rice wine and yogurt soju, and ate several plates of satisfying Korean drinking food, including cheese corn (where have you been all my life?) and tteokbokki (the grown-up comfort food of my dreams), all while listening to K-pop, and therefore had an all-around great time. We'll probably be back within the week. Two thumbs up-slash-five stars for our new favorite bar!"}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out after months of trolling the reviews. I think I just found my perfect Korean dive bar. Best part: I can walk home if I've had one soju bottle too many!   Korean bar food with some American comfort food fusion like the bulgogi fries, which were pretty awesome. Spicy fire chicken was addicting, and the corn aka \"Korean elote\" was impressive. Spam and eggs, fried chicken are other items on the menu that are on my \"to try\" list.   We ordered makkoli (milky rice wine) and Soju (rice wine-much stronger than makkoli) and shared between 4 people, as well as a pitcher of Cass. Karaoke singers are comically terrible here, but I feel like that is part of the charm.   My only concern was that there were only two servers in the entire bar/restaurant so I had to hunt my server down every now and then. Service was friendly, so it wasn't a deal breaker. Also, there are only single person bathrooms, so it could be a bit of a line to use the bathroom when it's crowded.   Overall, I enjoyed myself and my friends who came along enjoyed a taste of Korean bar food. I can't wait to go back and hopefully the watermelon soju with fruity pebbles and pop rocks is in season!"}
{"text":"This eccentric little joint is outstanding!  While it has a vibe kind of like a strange sibling of a college bar, the bulgogi is the best I've had in years, and the yogurt soju is similarly spectacular!  I'll be back, and likely frequently!"}
{"text":"Great name........menu looks good. Inside, not so much. Nothing inside this place make me want to eat food. Sitting at the bar I don't want to look to the left and see all the toiletry products to the bar.  Great name........play some rock and roll, put some good looking Asian girls behind the bar.  Make this place fun!!!!"}
{"text":"YUM! I've never been here and decided to come with a friend who has had nothing but great things to say about this place. The pineapple fried rice is to die for and the Ttkeokbokki is delicious especially if you pair with the option of the cheese . The atmosphere is low key and mellow and I thoroughly enjoyed the music that was played during the evening. By the way Jasmine our server was lively, super entertaining and enthusiastic about everything. All in all, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Soju watermelon. Bulgogi fries. Kalbi. Karaoke. So yeah, highly recommend. The vibe is nice, with kpop playing on the screens and kareoke with a wide variety of English and Asian songs. Definitely come here with friends."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Very unique for the Phoenix area.  Don't sit in the bar area though.  The vibe isn't the same.  You have to get a table in the back."}
{"text":"Best short ribs in town, love to go there for a drink and karoake def a chill place to hang with friends, great service at all times"}
{"text":"This Korean bar has a variety of drunk munchies, including authentic Korean street food and homemade American choices like chili cheese fries. If you're into spicy food, try the fire chicken; although it can be aggressively spicy, the tasty flavor is accented by the cheese."}
{"text":"The food here was excellent and service was prompt and polite. I've tried most of their menu and I keep coming back for the Bulgogi fries. Drunken Tiger's food is the most authentic korean food you can find here in Arizona. I recommend coming in and grabbing dinner. Also, if you tell the server named kelvin the phrase, \"are you ok anne?\" he may provide you with a discount on your meal!"}
{"text":"This is a very relaxed restaurant with late night food options. We ordered the seasoned Korean fried chicken, cheese corn, and bulgogi fries. The Korean fried chicken was crispy and seasoned perfectly and the cheese corn is soooo good. The bulgogi fries were way too salty and after a few bites, we left the majority of it untouched but I'll definitely be visiting again soon to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"I was here on a Saturday night at around 7PM and was pleasantly surprised to see that this place wasn't super noisy. The food was delicious, I really enjoyed the cocktail soju that they had. It was sweet and went along really well with the bulgogi Nachos that we ordered. The staff was very attentive and helpful and answered any questions that we had about food or anything else.  They also have karaoke which I found to be a nice touch and added to the friendly atmosphere they had going on.  I will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  Absolutely delicious. The Wings were incredible (red sauce - was so tasty).  The tofu (with pork belly & kimchee) was especially great."}
{"text":"I always can rely on Drunken Tiger because they're open until midnight or later depending on the day. This place has good food you can share with your friends and cheap drinks. I recommend their soju cocktails and ICEings. Cocktails are $10 each that you can have for yourself and it will get the job done. Lastly, the staff is extremely friendly and hard workers."}
{"text":"Love that this place is open until 2am! I would recommend the KFC, Steamed Egg, and Spicy Pork with a side of Rice. Great place to hang out, sip on some drinks and enjoy some great food. Oh and if your not too shy, there's also karaoke!"}
{"text":"It's mainly just bar food and I haven't tried much, but it has a relaxing atmosphere and I love the steamed egg."}
{"text":"Gabli was on point!!!!  OB beer always good!  Strawberry Sochu was pretty good but dangerous.... If you know what I mean.  Great experience, awesome service.  Food came out quick and bomb ass kimchi (house made from what I'm told).  We'll be coming back!!! #bombasskbbq"}
{"text":"I am so happy that they have Korean fried chicken. It was delicious. The boneless was better than the wings, but both were delicious. We also had the cheese corn. I will have to return for the bulgogi fries. I want to try a lot more items here. I have a feeling I will be a frequent customer. Try the soju and relax. Great vibe. Great service. Very attentive."}
{"text":"Great food great vibe.  Karaoke for those feeling inspired to sing. Variety of bottled beverages to choose from.  Great for a late night snack.  Kitchen open until 1:20 am. The bulgogi is fantastic,  the chicken wings just the right crisp then sauced with the result being excellent wings. The rice dishes are all delicious  and perfectly cooked. The service matched the food and was excellent as well.   The food is so great and the staff is so attentive to the details it makes for a great place to lose track of time and have a good time.  The music keeps the place lively great place to check out.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"TLDR: 5/5 stars, best assortment of soju & best Korean anju (drunk food) in AZ + great service at great prices = win. Was my first time there, and definitely won't be my last. Go here!  Full Review: Closest thing to Gaam (well known LA/ktown soju bar) in AZ. They even have all of the flavored bottled soju (peach, grapefruit, pineapple, blueberry, etc) which was surprising because I personally hadn't been able to find them anywhere outside of Korea so props to this little gem of a place for carrying all of them in AZ.   Food also went above and beyond my expectations,  friends and I shared the ddukboki and fried chicken to go with our drinks which was probably the best I've had in AZ imo. Staff was also very friendly, attentive, and made the entire experience even better (shoutout to Jasmine who took very good care of us). Oh and to mention everything was verryyy reasonably priced and well worth it.   Great place to meet up with friends for casual drinks, pregame before hitting up Mill or Scottsdale (conveniently located right off the freeway) or a Tinder date spot ;D The only thing I would say I wish there were more of is more cute Asian chicks to interact/socialize with, but that's not to blame Drunken Tiger for :P"}
{"text":"Crunchy gizzard and the silkworm soup are my go to for snacks.    The watermelon with pop rocks, fruity pebbles, and soju was also fantastic and mouth watering!"}
{"text":"We came here after seeing the food featured on AZ republic. The seafood pancake was definitely the best you can get in the Phoenix area. I'd come here again just for that.   At some point, the owner came by to make sure everything was OK and threw in some extra appetizers! Service was amazing, drinks were great, food was great. Come here. Bring your friends."}
{"text":"Great authentic Korean food at a reasonable price    Service is very attentive    We will return"}
{"text":"Great place with great atmosphere!!! First thing you should know is most of the orders are big enough to share and definitely worth the price. Bulgogi fries are great as well as the tteokbeoki! Awesome karaoke/norae selection although I wish they had the newer stuff like Twice or BTS but I digress. Awesome place and Jason took great care of us and they let us stay for quite a while."}
{"text":"I'm pleasantly surprised by the food here and how good it tasted. We started off with the watermelon soju which was topped with fruity pebbles and pop rocks. Yummm! It definitely could have used more alcohol (maybe one more extra bottle of soju ) but tasty. I don't think it's worth $22 but perfect to share with your group of friends. We also got the Bulgogi fries, corn cheese and chicken wings. The fries were crunchy and would satisfy those late night cravings. The portion of the fries are huge so you can order one and share it amongst your friends. The corn cheese was tasty and the  chicken wings had a nice kick of spice"}
{"text":"Me and my family came here for my 21st birthday in May. I saw the restaurant by chance on my way to a hair appointment several months earlier and was pretty excited. I love Korean culture, so I was excited to get to try some of the food, and I figured the watermelon soju would be a fun first bar experience. We tried a few different menu items, and although everyone was a little nervous to try flavors out of their comfort zones, they all loved it. I definitely had the best 21st birthday I could ever imagine! My recommendations would definitely be getting the bulgogi nachos, they're super good! And if you like fruity drinks and you're with a group that also like fruity drinks, the watermelon soju is worth trying for sure! My parents still talk about how much they enjoyed the seafood pancake. The chicken was delicious as well! Seriously, check this place out! It's a hidden gem! I definitely plan on coming back soon, and hopefully next time I'll get a chance to do a little karaoke and flaunt my Kpop skills."}
{"text":"Came here for some drinks on Friday night. Place was pretty busy. The waiter was super nice and attentive and friendly.  Nice big parking lot outside  Ambience is more of a dim and cozy environment. Lots of drinking.  Love their Soju cocktails Korean music playing in the background. Drinks I believe weren't too expensive.   Good place to hang out and drink before heading out elsewhere  pretty random location on its own in this block."}
{"text":"Thumbs up for this place.  This was my second time here and not disappointed on anything that we ordered so far.  I don't remember the name of the dishes but who cares, as long as they are yummy   Watermelon soju was fun but not as strong as I expected, more soju in it please."}
{"text":"Awesome late night hangout spot. The food is pretty good. The rice cake with cheese is really good. Highly recommend for a Friday or Saturday night if you want to drink and have some Korean food at same time."}
{"text":"I came here with pretty high expectations!  I had heard about this place from several of my Yelper friends and what the hey lets do it!  The place is dark and 90's style karaoke bar.  I sat at the bar; small selections, but I can make do.  My buddy joined me tonight and we were intrigued by the fusion of American bar food and Korean bites.  We started withe Bulgogi Cheese Fries along with some Korean Fried Chicken.  My buddy also ordered their Ramen.  Starting with the fries I was definitely excited to try!  Needless to say, the fries were cooked well and crunchy with the cheese oozing, but I rather find it lacking in the Bulgogi department. (Insert Sad Emoji)  As we proceeded with the Fried Korean Chicken; pretty much popcorn chicken with a side of sweet and spicy sauce and chipotle mayo.  I can see how the chicken would work as beer food.  In the end, Drunken Tiger is a cool spot, but it just didn't do it for me.  I like the concept, but definitely needs more crafting in their part.  I rather enjoyed my quick visit, but we'll see if there's a come back! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I had really high expectations for this place. All my friends go here and I was excited to try the food. As soon as we came in the atmosphere was chill and we were seated right away. I get that there was only one cook and one waitress so wasn't too upset about the time it took to get our food. (I was the last to get my food even though I ordered first and everyone was done as soon as I got my food). my husband and I ordered the bugolgi fries and salt and pepper shrimp. The bugolgi fries were really cheesy but could use more bugolgi, especially being $16. still good tho.  What really pissed me off the most  was the shrimp. I took one bite and realized the shrimp was completely raw. like still grey raw. I then noticed my entire plate was still raw. I was so disgusted. I don't think I could ever come here again after that."}
{"text":"Yaaasssss! What a pretty cool spot for some Korean food! It has a variety of yummy delights here! I like that there is such a wide range of food to choose from. Things you would mostly find in California, is here! I like the simple atmosphere. It is a bit loud inside with the music because it is a part bar (and most of the music is Korean pop), and geared more towards feeding the drunkies LOL but I think it's a cool place! I hope they thrive.  The food tasted great. The galbi was a bit burnt but the salt and pepper shrimp was good! And the sweet and sour chicken was amazingly kimchi fried rice was great as well! I like it and will be back. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"It's a very fun place to be! Bring a few friends along for great food, drinks and even karaoke if you want. Or just enjoy the kpop music playing in the background.  I had a little of different things during my previous times, but the most recent, I ate the 12 Fried Chicken piece (garlic Parmesan flavor) for $15.99 and drank Cass beer with it. It's like a complete Korean experience right there since fried chicken and beer is a \"common tradition\" in South Korea. When I was over there, we literally went to a bunch of fried chicken and beer places over the course of our stay. Heck, we even had friend chicken and beer delivered to our apartment. lol.  So it was awesome to experience fried chicken and beer again. The chicken was extremely flavorful and tender. And you can literally taste the crunchy garlic on top of the chicken. It was so crunchy! And of course, drinking the Korean brand, Cass, beer completes the experience.  It's a little pricey but the food is good. The restaurant is also a little short staffed but I don't know if there is another Korean restaurant in the valley like this one. It's one of a kind at the moment."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of the pojangmacha's that I used to go to back home and is where my friends and I like to go to if we get the itch to play some Korean drinking games without being judged(I hope). I definitely enjoy their menu more now since they've changed ownership. Their fire chicken is bomb if you like spicy and the fact that they have silkworm soup(even though I hate it) is what does it for me. My only request for the owner's is to bring back the crispy duk!"}
{"text":"Needs better servers who know their restaurant, don't recommend it the food wasn't that amazing and the karaoke wasn't that great either"}
{"text":"Celebrating a birthday with my clique! Jasmine is our favorite server and she is AMAZING! We have been coming here since this was Cafe Agit and this is one of the only LA Ktown feel eatery. Watermelon soju and yogurt soju are a must. They have Karaoke too."}
{"text":"Delicious, unique food!!! We ordered the pina (pineapple sesame) chicken wings and corn cheese! I highly recommend both. Excellent customer service! Great happy hour prices on beer - giant Coors Light for $2.50. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been looking for good Korean food with a fun atmosphere for quite some time now. I lived in Korea for a year and LOVED ordering Korean fried chicken for delivery and LOVE Yangnyeom chicken! This place has it and it's pretty Damn good! Paired it with some classic Hite of course. Bringing friends back for sure!"}
{"text":"This a great bar to hang out for happy hour! The food and drinks are authentic, I felt like I was back visiting Korea. My favorite drink is the giant soju drink served in half a watermelon!!! The drink is perfect for sharing amongst friends on a hot summer day.  This drink is not only photogenic it is delicious, refreshing and hella fun. The food that we tried was very good, the wings won as favorite dish at our table. The Korean red sweet and spicy perfectly fried wings are lust worthy. The spicy squid was also sauced and prepared just right, all it needs is a side of white rice. The service was a little slow towards the end of our meal but the food and atmosphere is where this restaurant really shines."}
{"text":"Drunken tiger is fantastic!  Staff very friendly, Owner / Chef Justin knows his way around the kitchen.  Had noodle bowl, great flavor.  Went with friends and we all enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"Drunken Tiger is a good Korean bar food place. Food is better quality from Cafe Agit the previous restaurant. Good environment and good food!"}
{"text":"Totally had a blast at Drunken Tiger. Service was awesome and the food was fantastic. For those that love to eat spicy things, I would recommend the Fire Chicken. That dish will light your mouth on fire! They even got a karaoke machine for you to sing your lungs out too! Definitely worth visiting again especially when you want to drink and have some dank Korean drunchies!"}
{"text":"Ok 1st off jasmine amd jane gave EXCELLENT service! I wish i took pictures before i ate but  the food was absolutey great. I got the rice cake app and the fire chicken with mozzarella. Sooooo good! I DEFINITELY WILL BE RETURNING! come here you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We had a very good time.  The rice cake appetizer was awesome and creative!  The Fire Chicken was VERY hot but delicious.  We will definitely come back!  The Drunken Tiger was a fun surprise we need to come back to try more things!"}
{"text":"We came to the new neighborhood joint tonight for some late night snacks.  We dined on Bulgogi Nacho Fries, Daku Chicken, and the Watermelon Soju.    Very large portions.  Tasty food.  Would come again.  Get ready for the Koreans to rock your mouth with these tasty treats!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing korean place! their soju is quite amazing. Beef bulgogi is very tasty! Not that packed and great fast service for a weeknight."}
{"text":"Definitely not the best Korean BBQ in Arizona . Very greasy galbi, low quality seafood pancake . After eating there I feel gross . Hodori is good not far away . Do not let the solicited 5 star yelp reviews fool you . The restaurant asks for reviews in exchange of a percent discount . Poor business practice"}
{"text":"How did it take me so long to find Drunken Tiger? The name alone is great enough!   Drunken Tiger is a Korean bar that has great bar like Korean food and plays hip Kpop music.   We ordered:  1. Fire Chicken -- super spicy chicken with cheese on top. Very good, but prepared to ask for another jug of water to go with it.   2. Bulgogi Fries -- heaping portion of it, it was great but the bulgogi portion was so small and chopped it. I wish they were in bigger pieces. Don't think I'd order again.   3. Tteok Kochi? -- slightly pan-fried rice cakes with this red sauce that had peanuts in it. LOVE this dish. These rice cakes are different than the regular tteokbokki dish since this one isn't really spicy at at all.   Service was excellent, everyone came by and ask how our food was, and was super friendly.   I would give this place 4.5 stars, and I'll just round up to 5 on Yelp since their service was great, and I definitely will come back."}
{"text":"I tried drunken tiger for the first time tonight and it did not disappoint! We had the potstickers and the takoyaki: octopus hush puppies . Omg let's talk about coming out of my comfort zone. So glad I tired them! So good! We then had the Korean fried chicken, comes with 2 sauces. And then the pineapple fried rice with shrimp and peanuts. We didn't do dessert but they have this watermelon filled with some sort or cream we will have to def come back and try. Thanks for the amazing service and the amazing food that came our piping hot btw!  We will most def be back! Thanks Drunken Tiger!"}
{"text":"We came here after seeing a picture of the bugolgi fries.  We found it hidden in that corner, it was very hard to see since we came at night. But thankfully we persisted.  We were seated right away and served very quickly. We ordered the Korean fried chicken, cheese corn, and the pork belly bao.  Before I start on the food review...drink that water....I drank so much because it was delicious!   Now back to the food....it did not disappoint.  The corn cheese was the best I've had, I have tried it at other places and this one wins out because it was not super greasy and the flavors were balanced.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and the red sauce it was served with, just took it to the next level.  I just wish they tossed the chicken in it, instead of serving it on the side. Now the pork belly bao...nothing bad can be said...perfectly balanced flavors and the sweet complimented the pickeled veggies. Don't forget to check out the board before you order."}
{"text":"Saw this was fairly new, definitely too me it was new... Had to try this, based on the pics from this place, had been craving some good KFC (Korean Fried Chicken).  We ordered the KFC (Padak style), Bulgogi Nachos, Spicy Pork & Kim Chi/Bacon Fried Rice.  Well, the KFC was ok, a bit dry, but I can look past that since it is white meat...but to add green onions, it's $2.00 more...don't get me wrong...I don't mind paying, but for what we got and the quality, not as much.  The Bulgogi nachos were ok, nice intro of some fusion there.  The spicy pork was really good though, that's why I can say I would go back.  The Kim Chi/Bacon fried rice was ok, would like to have had more kim chi though.  I would definitely recommend, because the overall quality is worth it and the server was fairly attentive, considering he had a full house and he was basically the only server for a bit.  Then another waitress showed up, so it helped."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in to check out the scene and to get the watermelon soju bowl. Nevertheless, the staff was amazing and the food and drink was on point. What's more, is they have karaoke! Who doesn't love good food, drink and singing! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ugh this place makes me addicted to Korean bar food. I never get disappointed coming here. And they open late and offers free karaoke and it's just a fun time every time I go here. Their popcorn chicken and spicy rice cake is to die for! They also offer bulgogi fries which is a staple every time you come here! Definitely recommend this easily to my friends and family!"}
{"text":"Get the Bulgogi Nacho Fries!!! They are incredibly tasty! The basket is huge, so you can easily share with someone    They also have Karaoke! Win!"}
{"text":"They have the best chicken feet I've ever had. I love this place!"}
{"text":"First time in with some friends ordered bulgogi fries, fire chicken, and cheese corn all of it was amazing. The flavoured soju has made a spot as one of my new favorite drinks"}
{"text":"Came for the burn and got what we came for. went with a posse and ordered lots off the menu. The beer was cold and the karage was hot. There were mild things for the fragile palates as well. We liked the wings and the rice dishes were good. But the star was the Holy Sh- hot red chicken. Bulgulgi for the babies... Will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome place to get drinks and hang with friends ..food and drinks are awesome...get the makgeolli!! Staff is great and atmosphere was very trendy"}
{"text":"THE WORST COSTUMER SERVICE! Came in with my boyfriend (who tends to be a bit indecisive) and ordered. He chose to get something else a minute after ordering, and went up to the server to place a different order. Ten minutes later, the server told us we HAD to pay for the first order even though we didn't want it and even after we changed the order a mere minute after our initial order. My poor boyfriend still paid for it, not wanting to cause any disagreement in the restaurant. At any other restaurant, a changed order would be accepted, considering there are so many indecisive people in this world. Just disappointed. The food was good, still. This experience just ruined the whole place for us, though."}
{"text":"First time in tonight. We started with a yogurt soju cocktail and it tasted really good. We ordered 2 plates of appetizers (rice cakes and fried chicken) and 2 drunken eats (spicy squid and fire chicken) and pineapple fried rice and bulgogi fries. The bulgogi fries were huge! The other plates were a little bit on the smaller/medium size which makes sense, because it's supposed to be food to eat while drinking. The environment here reminds me of Korean restaurants in LA. It's fun and casual. A great environment for drinking and hanging out with friends. There is karaoking too which can get too loud to talk with others though."}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted by a nice gentleman who turned out to be our waiter. Ordered the bulgogi fries (which were OK) and the Galbi.   The galbi was all bones, barely any meat (see the picture I posted). We informed the waiter who in turn called the manager. Manager comes over and sees all bones and says he will take the galbi off our bill.   When the bill comes, galbi is still on there. We ask the waiter what's going on and he says the manager changed his mind and will not be removing the galbi from our bill. No explanation was given and the manager wouldn't even come out to speak with us.   Very disrespectful. Lied to us. Paid $20 for bones.   I don't recommend this place at all and will not be returning."}
{"text":"We got the Bulgogi fries, fried chicken, wings, salt and pepper shrimp, ddukbeogi, and the watermelon soju. Food and alcohol were of good quality, but I gave three stars because the service was alright and the food came out at really awkward intervals. Overall was good atmosphere, good food, and good drinks, but the service held it back a bit."}
{"text":"I was expecting this to be a restaurant/bar, but I was wrong. This is certainly a hi hop bar with the food being a distant second. Evidenced by the loud, conversation limiting, music and limited menu items that could be considered entrees.   Most of the menu is fried, bar style, food and poorly fried at that.  The mozzarella sticks were hardly heated through and the cheesy was not gooey or stringy.  The batter was interesting, similar to what I like on onion rings, not sure how I feel about it on cheese.  They serve it with...ketchup. #nowords   Then I ordered the chicken wings, Korean red spicy(??).  Things did not improve. The wings are heavily breaded (-1). The frying method allows oil to soak into the breading (-1). The sauce was ok, but not spicy at all (-1, had a single chili pepper on it). Seemed sweet.    The sweet and sour chicken was sweet. Maybe the warm pickles are the sour? Not sure, not the biggest pickle fan and certainly not warm ones.   Maybe alcohol washes down the grease and oil? I don't know, I don't drink.   Service was relatively inattentive. Stood waiting to be seated (empty tables everywhere) for a good 5 min before a customer notified staff we were there. Table service was mediocre, but it took almost 10min for them to notice we were done eating. In fairness to them, I ate 2 of my wings, so we were done unexpectedly quick.  It would take an act of god for me to return."}
{"text":"Great service! There's a lot of food!! So order family style. The waitress was really nice and did everything with a smile on her face."}
{"text":"Good food, nice ambience. Service can be a little slow but not bad. Great place for 21st birthdays"}
{"text":"Fun fact: Drunken Tiger is the name of a famous Korean hip-hop band that made their debut in 1999.  Review 9/10 for the 10 bookmarked businesses to review before the end of 2016! From Meagan B.'s thread: https://www.yelp.com/topic/phoenix-yelp-phoenixs-10-firsts-of-2016  The menu at Drunken Tiger is fairly similar to its predecessor Cafe Agit with a few more bar food type foods thrown into the mix like nachos and fries. We ordered a ton of food, most of it some sort of fried chicken. The padak chicken had a light crispy batter with the requisite curly strips of green onion on top, served with a wasabi/horseradish soy sauce and a creamier sweet sauce. The popcorn chicken was essentially the same as the padak but with different dipping sauces (A sweet chile sauce and another creamy sauce). The grilled meats we had were the kalbi and spicy pork. The kalbi had a good marinade on it and had a nice proportion of meat on the platter. The spicy pork was tender, well seasoned and I liked how it actually delivered on the spiciness level unlike other Korean restaurants where there is barely a whiff of chile pepper in their \"spicy\" marinated grilled meat.  I did make a special request for bulgolgi fries which were essentially the fries version of their bulgolgi nachos. The fries had a light crispness, smothered in gooey cheese and topped with olives, pico de gallo, jalapeños, and chopped up bulgolgi. It tasted great overall and was a huge portion but I do wish I could taste a little more of the bulgolgi flavor and meat in the meal.   We also ordered some seafood pancake which was generously filled with seafood, with a crispy crust to contrast with the softer textures of the filling.   Our Bizarre Foods moment came when someone ordered the silkworm soup. It came out piping hot, and had a weird funky aroma to me. I figured hey, I'll try almost anything once so why not try this? I was handed two silkworms on my plate. I examined them and tried to ignore the fact that they looked like something that I pay an exterminator to get rid of every month. The actual broth they were \"cocooned\" in was bold and fiery. I bit into a corner of a silkworm to find it was too chewy and chitinous for my tastes so I just ended up swallowing them whole like a bitter pill, following each swallow with a copious amount of soju. Even though I wasn't really a fan of the soup I appreciate that they offer this dish to those that do enjoy it!  Now the soju... It was served in a gigantic hollowed out watermelon, blended with fresh watermelon pulp and juice, topped with Fruity Pebbles and Pop Rocks. Truly a sight to behold and a combination that makes you wonder if someone had been on a mind-bending substance while thinking of this drink (Or maybe they had eaten too many silkworms that day). I liked the fresh watermelon but I don't think there was a lot of soju in the actual drink since I was feeling barely anything after a few rounds.  There was a mix up as we were initially served a regular bulgolgi plate instead of the fries, and I did have to remind the server about a missing drink order, but the server was apologetic and provided friendly service.   The interior seems pretty much the same was Cafe Agit, with various TV screens either playing a game or K-Pop.  Overall I think this a great option for late night eats or if you want Korean food for dinner. There were a good number of people seated here on a Friday night having conversations in Korean which is always a good sign that the food and beverage here is legit. We had a good time and I'll be back again for more food!"}
{"text":"Drunken Tiger took us last night!  First and foremost to clear things up: Drunken Tiger is a bar. It is a restaurant second. There were no other children but mine and it made things awkward. The walls are black, music loud and neon signs provided more light then the lightbulbs... it was 5pm. Very fun if your with friends , not toddlers. :/  First order of business, appetizers. We decided on the Fire Chicken, fried potstickers and chicken wings.  Fire Chicken: WAY TOO HOT. Made me sick all night HOT. Heartburn all night HOT. We could not eat it and beware when ordering. Potstickers: so much better fried than steamed, we had to actually order 2 because the first round was so yummy and my son ate most of them.  Chicken wings: the BEST you will ever eat. They are spicy yet tangy and are breaded to perfection. We should have ordered more because those were the star of the show!  For entree we ordered the $19.99 Korean spare ribs which were not the best, not the highlight of the evening. The portion was eerily small compared to the price tag of the plate and after eating the wings, the comparison was steep. Also, the service is crazy slow, literally 1 server for 9 tables.  Overall, we ate here once and truth be told, we won't return."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to this place. Prices were kind of expensive all around, but the food was very good. I ordered the Bulgogi.   Loved the Korean music and videos for the ambience it created along with the dimly-lit atmosphere.  It was karaoke night, which was alright. But it got kind of loud once that business started going down.  Will definitely check it out again."}
{"text":"This place has a casual bar feel and the best part about the atmosphere is the Kpop music playing in the background.  They have karaoke, but no one was singing.  We ordered steamed egg, mozzarella sticks, tofu kimchi (tofu, pork belly, & kimchi), and seafood pancake. The mozzarella sticks were fried perfectly, the tofu kimchi was definitely delicious, and the steamed egg was great. The seafood pancake was a little undercooked, but we brought it home and heated it up in a pan so it tasted really good when cooked more.  Service was fast and curt.  Overall, I would go back for the food."}
{"text":"I am so happy that this place is so close! Very different vibe from the outside, but very cool inside :) I love that they had kpop videos on their tvs but it would have been better if their music they were playing matched the videos that were playing as well.   We got the Bulgogi Fries which were amazing! Didn't realize how big they were! The crunchiness really made it that much better. We also did the Soju basket bundle which came with 5 beers so enough for a big group to share. We also ordered Dduk Boki which was satisfying especially for those of you who love spicy food!   We also did the Watermelon Soju which was very yummy! The sprinkle fruity pebbles and pop rocks on it too which makes it pretty and fun. Don't think it's worth $22 though because you cannot even taste the Soju.   I would love to come back and try other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Just got done watching Pete's Dragon on Netflix, and it made us hungry for some KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) do we hit up Yelp! and found this little gem. Pleasantly surprised by how good the wings were, great flavor with just the right amount of spicy kick to 'em.. if it's not enough for you just add some heat!  Also don't forget to get the corn cheese, it's a must."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere!  Very good for spot to grab drinks with friends and enjoy some authentic Korean food."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good to hang out late hours with good food. Fast and friendly service. Fun young atmosphere. There's the patio outside for those who want to chill there instead."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and it never disappoints. Food is always wonderful and the soju is delicious. Pork belly dumplings, kimchi rice and their ramen is always good. Food is spicy and flavorful. This place has become a favorite."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went on a Friday night and there was only 2 people serving. So I understand that it is hard :/ however, they served the table that came in after us first and we were waiting for 40 minutes. Minus 1 star.   The food was alright. We got the bulgogi ($17ish) and bulgogi fries ($12). The food wasn't warm enough and got cold pretty fast :/ the bulgogi fries had good cheesy fries but the fries tasted a little stale. Minus 1 star.  Overall, I like the atmosphere of this place. The concept of the Karaoke is really cool and I like that it's dark in there. It is good beer food, but not that great if you're sober."}
{"text":"I was missing this korean spicy chicken so badly. This was really delicious And spicy rice cake thing is awesome as well. We added cheese and ramen noodle. If you are finding Korean food I recommend this place and you can also enjoy korean music"}
{"text":"I saw that they had participated in the Phoenix Night Market last month... Went to this place because I had never had Korean food before and I wanted to feel it out before going to an all you can eat BBQ place. The Drunken Tiger did not disappoint. The bulgogi was amazing, the cheese fries were amazing, and the fried chicken was amazing. The server was extremely helpful and patient with us. Excited to come back soon!"}
{"text":"This place was just okay. The service was great, and I liked the outside patio. The baos were very good, and the bulgogi fries were huge! However, the fries weren't the greatest. It's more of a tapas place, good for small plates. I'm not too sure if I would come back because the tapas  are a little over priced. ($10+) and the menu options are pretty small."}
{"text":"We all came to celebrate a friend getting her first nursing job ... we ordered the watermelon soju along with a bucket of beer+soju .. we ordered the cheesy corn, bulgogi fries, fire chicken along with dduk bukki.. all the food was delicious and the service was pretty decent... I would definitely come back here to try more food from their menu.. but it is a little pricey.."}
{"text":"This is firstly a bar.  The food is a bit pricey so we went with an appetizer, Kim Chee fries. I feel the Kim Chee doesn't need to have sugar, butter would have been fine. No happy hour menu here, only for drinks. Waiter was very friendly and welcoming so I gave it an extra set are."}
{"text":"Incredible Korean food! Great any kind of food! Pot stickers to die for! Bolgogi wonderful! Seafood pancake very good! Staff very helpful & very friendly. We will be back! They also have an outdoor deck to eat on along water that was so beautiful & relaxing! The pinapple soju is wonderful.  My husband enjoyed a soju bomb. We also got a couple of soju samples. Next time I'm going for straight soju. It was really good & a surprisingly good taste. My tongue liked it a lot!  The staff will help you with drink orders as well as food orders."}
{"text":"I love coming here! The service is friendly, atmosphere is great & food is delicious! I come almost every week to get my fix of the corn cheese & padak. It's also a fun place to just grab drinks with friends & hangout/sing karaoke. Certainly recommend coming here, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Searched all around the valley for a Korean bar, definitely coming back here. Food & alcohol was amazing & their Udon tasted fresh! This spot is a hidden gem for sure"}
{"text":"This is more of a 3.5 but not quite a 4 yet...  Drunken tiger is essentially a korean bar/pub. There is flavored soju and Korean fried chicken and a bunch of other bar foods. I came in with a friend after searching for a place that does Korean fried chicken in Phoenix.   The fried chicken was good, but it was drenched in sauce. The soju was good, but it really just a mix so there isn't much to mess up.   Overall, it was good, but service was slow and I miss the table buttons you push for service. While drunken tiger seems A-OK, i'm still on the hunt for a good Korean bar."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had, ever. We walked in and nobody was anywhere near the door to greet us. When the host/server finally walked up to us and asked how many, after we told her she stopped in the middle of us telling her to exchange jokes with another server! We sat down and nobody took our food order for at least 15 minutes (btw there were only 4 parties in the place) I had to get up and ASK OUR SERVER FOR WATER because she NEVER brought us any.   When our food came, in a timely manner, the bao was decent but had very little meat and the ramen was basically the kind you buy for $90 cents with a few veggies thrown in. Soggy in some parts and undercooked in others.  I watched the wait staff taking shots at the bar.   I get that this place is supposed to have a bar atmosphere, but c'mon, at least ask me if I need water dude."}
{"text":"Cheesy corn is simple but the melted cheese is quite excellent. Takoyaki has good flavor and a good balanced of flavors. Chicken wings with the Korean red is cooked well and has good flavor."}
{"text":"The spicy Korean style chicken was really good!! You can either 8 or 16 pieces and it tastes very similar to chicken in Korea. Also, the spicy rice cake was good!! It is not very spicy so anyone can enjoy it :)"}
{"text":"Ok so im giving 3 stars because the food was fresh tasting but i will not be coming back here. The food (for lack of better wording) didnt taste very Korean. I should have known pretty much when I asked about the Korean sides along with the Korean barbecue and the waiter explained that they are not a traditional Korean restaurant and did not serve the Korean barbecue with sides. We got beef bulgogi and fried rice. In the past when I've gotten fried rice Korean restaurants (which isn't very often) but when I do get it it taste Korean like it doesn't taste like Chinese fried rice it has a special Korean flavor. The beef bulgogi tasted like when I try to make Chinese stir fry at home. It did not have the Korean flavor it just tasted like meat with soy sauce. It was expensive for what it was. Part of me wanted to send it back but I came with my two year old and he was hungry and had already started eating the food. They had some other interesting things on the menu so perhaps they are more focused on these special items and less on Korean food or flavors. The waiter was in charge of the whole restaurant as well as the bar so the service was not great but he was very nice. Also, when we order the fried rice the waiter said that it had peanuts in it and asked if that was okay and I said yeah. I was not aware that it would be so full of peanuts. There was a disproportionate amount of peanuts compared to Rice. It is unpleasant to have 5 peanuts per bite of rice. I will post a picture."}
{"text":"So this Korean place is bar, does not have the sides you would get from Gogi or Cho Dang. The staff is nice and the food is descent. I did not like the pineapple fried rice. Too much fish sauce but the guy who cooked it was nice and changed my order with no issue.  I would say Gogi  or Chodang are still my favorite places to go."}
{"text":"The food here is good especially the wings. I don't know that I would bring children here as the rap music in English and Korean contains foul language. I'm sure at night this turns into a Korean Club bar food scene so get here early if you want to avoid the crowds. I've been told that the bulgogi fries do not have enough bulgogi"}
{"text":"I live on the west side. I was on the east side hanging out with friends. So I decided to get a take out of the bulgogi fries, since it looks so appetizing on Yelp. The bulgogi fries was below average. I would have expected more meat since I paid 18 bucks for an order of fries. The flavor was just okay. Nothing really special. I even get more meat when I order the carna asada fries at Federico's. Also, they didn't even give me a folk, I had to ask for it. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I usually drive out to Chandler, Tempe or Phoenix to go out to eat but my husband and I decided to try somewhere a little more close to home. Mesa doesn't have a lot of cool, hip places to eat so our expectations were low. We were pleasantly surprised.  This Korean restaurant has a young, trendy vibe with it's black-walled interior and K-POP videos.  This place is perfect for date night or drinks with friends.    I have to say though that the food is a little pricey and took a while to come out. I do love that they try not to be wasteful.  They don't fill up your water unless you ask and they don't serve you kimchi unless you want it. Kimchi is kind of like the Japanese equivalent of wasabi or ginger, something that is served on the side of most dishes but never gets eaten. I asked for the kimchi because I've never had it and wanted to try it. I took one bite and I was NOT a fan.  I kind of felt terrible for wasting it...  Overall, my husband and I had a good time and enjoyed our food.    CAUTION: Your clothes will reek of Korean BBQ when you get home. Whether that's good or bad, that's up to you."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome vibe!! Great music, cool lighting. Food is awesome!! Definitely greatest Korean BBQ in the area!! Will be back!!"}
{"text":"What a fun a delightful place this was!  Since we were not familiar with most of the items on the menu our waiter was extremely helpful in choosing a few things to try - can't wait to come back and try more. We had the mussels, wings and potstickers. Each had just the right amount of spice and a wonderful flavor, different from anything I have had.  The bucket of beer and soju were the perfect compliment to the food."}
{"text":"I came here last night to eat and to have a beer. Atmosphere was good and also the music but the service was slow and they ignored me. I only got one beer out of the whole night, they didn't ask if I wanted another beer or if I wanted food.... they passed by me 7 times while they helped everyone else out. I was the only one at the bar too. I left disappointed and I don't think I'll go back :/"}
{"text":"Food was nice. Watermelon soju is great for groups. Service was alright. Food came out at separate times and one of my friend's food didn't come out until the end."}
{"text":"Drunken Tiger is a great bar. It reminds me of K town and the bars there. The liquor and beer is well priced and the food is great after you've been drinking (or before). It's definitely more bar food than not so you may have trouble eating dinner here in a traditional sense. Korean bars are about communal eating and drinking, so expect to share plates and bottles. Feel free to ask the servers anything. Their English is plenty good and they would rather you ask than get something you don't want to eat or don't know how to eat."}
{"text":"Good food and great service! The kimchi is tasty and the udon noodles were nice and hot. Definitely recommend the galbi!"}
{"text":"What kind of Korean restaurant doesn't serve kimchi side dishes? The reason Korean restaurants charge more is because the cost of kimchis.  Therefore, this place is the most expensive Korean restaurant in PHX area! The waitress explained that they serve \"Korean Street Food\", really? Street food with fine dinning price? Let's talk about the food now. If I don't know this a Korean place, I would say it is a Chinese restaurant because I don't taste garlic at all which is the signature taste for Korean food. Oh, by the way, the portion is so small that we had to go to Burger King to get some chicken nuggets. Nevertheless, got robbed once, never again!"}
{"text":"Good food, comfortable atmosphere, karaoke, friendly fast service, and soju that is tasty (dangerously smooth). Best bid for late night eats!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They have amazing food. Some of my favorites would have to be the Bulgogi, corn cheese, pot stickers, and sausage & veggie stir fry. Their Bulgogi is very flavorful and well cooked. It's thinly sliced  marinated beef, that is slightly sweet, and has a soy based saltiness. Along with green onions, and normal onions. The corn cheese is their take on elotes. It's served on a hot plate, with mozzarella, pepper, and green onions. They also have a fire version that's spicy and has pork belly added to it! The pot stickers comes with 7 on a bed of cabbage, drizzled with spicy mayo. They are deep fried. And delicious! The veggie stir fry with sausage is kinda spicy. The veggies consist of cabbage, carrot, onions. The sausage are slices are nicely sized. Thick, but still comfortable enough to eat in one bite. It comes with rice, so you have something to eat it with.  Over all I have always been satisfied, taste wise and full wise! The servers are friendly and will help explain any dishes you might not be sure about. The food gets out fast too. This is deff place where you get multiple plates and share with the people at your table. But don't let that discourage you if it's just you and another person. My boyfriend and I come here, just us, all the time. I would recommend this place to anyone, and I do! :)"}
{"text":"Had such a blast with a group of friends here.  What could be better than Bulgogi fries, soju watermelon, wings and karaoke? My friends keep asking when we are coming back again, so much fun.   I have also come just for dinner on a weeknight. Basically I'm shameless addicted to DT Bulgogi and the kimchi, always end up ordering another side.... So good!   Come, bring friends, eat, drink, hang out on the patio, sing your heart out. Its a great time"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite go to dinner spot! NEED I say more! The place is always full of smiling guest and staff! The Ambience and atmosphere although is joyful. I've been here a few times and i can't say I ever seen an out of order or dirty establishment. If you go the this location you won't receive bad customer service or cold food. I'd recommend this place to anyone check out the pics. Mouthwatering!  Spicy mussels are the best if u can't stand the heat get a bowl of rice. Oh thank me later"}
{"text":"Ok dishes, under average Korean restaurant. No service, or rude services, you will NOT feel welcome. Noise all the time, not very good environment, wonder where those good reviews come from. It is my first time here and I will never comeback."}
{"text":"Got food, got drunk, waitresses were cool as shit, and the music was poppin. Overall, I'll come back as soon as I have more money and when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great service and food! The waitress Jasmine is very attentive and friendly. She was also helpful describing the menu. To keep it short and simple, if you're looking for a LA Ktown vibe this is the only place in Arizona that you'll find it."}
{"text":"Since the owners have changed, food has definitely has gotten better. Chicken feet is a must & tofu kimchee is also great. Maybe a bit more meat would be nice. Service may be little different & slow because theybhave out door sitting & one server working the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"According to legend, 5,000 years ago a Chinese empress discovered silk when a silkworm cocoon fell into her tea. Here at Drunken Tiger, you can find silkworms in your soup!  What a fun filled night with Adam A., Karen W., her husband David, Grace O. (Nice to finally meet ya, missy!), and Glenn! There was a parade of three popcorn chicken dishes (the Padak Chicken coming with green onions and different sauces), KBBQ, a seafood pancake, Bulgogi fries, and a steamy stinky bowl of silkworm pupae soup. Most of the bites were pretty delicious, especially the Bulgogi fries, but that silkworm soup... I can't say I'm a fan. Grace describes it best by comparing the texture to soft shell crab. The taste? It tastes like it smells and it smells pretty bad. For $10, you too can have the same experience! If anything, the silkworms look freaky as heck and will give you the shivers.  We also shared a watermelon soju that Grace and I ended up taking over. To be fair, there didn't seem to be much soju. The Fruity Pebbles were fun when they were crunchy but got soggy at the end. We also liked the Pop Rocks that came with our drink.  I felt like I was in Willy Wonka! \"Come with me and you'll be in a world of pure imagination...\"  Drunken Tiger is a fun place to go with a group of pals. Stop by for their Happy Hour and enjoy some decent eats!  There's a limited quantity of watermelon soju so plan accordingly!"}
{"text":"Was craving some great food, and cheap drinks. Dropped by and ordered up some takoyaki, delicious as always. Wanted to just get some snacks but ended up staying and eating an entire entree of good eats. Service great as always, along with drunk karaoke rap! Will recommended!"}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere was great. And the food was delicious it is a little pricy but service was excellent!!"}
{"text":"This place is great for your Korean-Pub food fix. You walk inside to a clean, friendly environment. The music was a little too loud for normal conversation, but it was still a great vibe. The food is great! We had the bulgogi fries, and it was a great combination of American and Korean. I do wish there was more meat in the fries, however. The drinks are fantastic. We ordered a Beer Bomb (Korean Beer and Soju) and one was plenty (and it was only $8.50!). Do not expect traditional Korean with the different kimchis when you get your food, this is very much your \"pub-style\" Korean food."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool for being in Mesa and totally reminds me of Ktown in LA. They have a ton of good bar foods but it is a bit pricey. We got the bulgogi fries (which is huge, so you can definitely share with a group of friends), their fire chicken was tasty and spicy. Their ttukbokki was pretty good and their cheesy corn was also good. My friends got the watermelon soju which looked amazing but they said they couldn't taste the alcohol in it and it was like $22 dollars! I could have made that myself at home :) anyways!  We didn't sit outside but I noticed the outside patio has seating over water, which I thought was awesome. The inside is your typical dark, bar atmosphere. The server was pretty quick and attentive. I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place is good. They ha s bulgolgi fries which I've never seen at any other Korean restaurant. The appetizer was a size good enough for like 2-3 people. There was little bulgolgi and quite expensive ($19.99). I got the boneless Korean fried chicken (KFC) because my friend said it is usually really good at other places. It was nothing special. Just regular popcorn chicken only with a dipping sauce not so flavorful.   There is dish that has rice cake and you can add egg, ramen noodles and cheese to it. That was pretty good however the sauce is really thick and sweet. I just mainly liked it because of the rice cakes.   My most favorite thing here is the takoyaki. It is always so weird how whenever I go to a restaurant, one of the things that become my favorite there are always the food outside of the ethnic group. The takoyaki was delicious but the fish flakes did not move around much. It barely moved actually, I do not know why...   I find it weird how they call dumplings \"potstickers\" at this place... There is an automatic 18% service charge fee at the end. Did not get to take a picture of the rice cake!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great drinks. Get the watermelon soju and do a couple soju bombs! Our server, Jasmine was awesome! Come out and bring your friends! Gamsahamnida!"}
