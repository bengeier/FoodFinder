{"text":"The burger was so tiny and when I told the cook perhaps owner all he said was \"really\" no customer service. They don't care about the customer. My brother and I will never eat here again   This is not a gourmet burger establishment. Terrible"}
{"text":"This is the place I go to when I want to treat myself. The staff are friendly and bring the burgers to your table.   My favourite burger is the Better Than the Other Guy. It's $6.99. When getting a combo, I recommend you to pay extra to get the sweet potato fries and the strawberry milkshake.  Their burgers are huge!"}
{"text":"My husband got a 20$ coupon for two so we decided to give it a go.  The wooden interior and the dark chunky furniture has given this place quite a character. As for the food, I got the Swiss Mushroom Melt and hubby ordered the Spicy Jalape√±o Burger. I didn't really find the cheese taste in my burger and hubby though that his was quite bland. I should say that the patty was sizzling hot and freshly made.  As a conclusion, this place has decent burgers but we're still looking for that perfect burger to die for!"}
{"text":"Ordered (through uber eats) the cheeseburger combo with milkshake and onion rings - as well as the greek salad (what a JOKE) and the poutine (Don't do it).... No salad dressing came with the greek salad.....which was actually just lettuce with some feta cheese on it....seriously steer clear, especially since it was $10.  The poutine - it was gross the fries weren't cooked through and were hard. Nobody likes an undercooked potato. The burger was basic and so were the onion rings...do yourself a favour and go to Holy Chuck's or some other decent place instead of wasting your $$$ here."}
{"text":"Unpretentious gourmet burger joint with fantastic decor. The burgers are above average - not OH MY GOD! but still very tasty. The sides (choice of fries, onion rings, or sweet potato fries) are all great, although I wish the sweet potato fries came with some sort of dipping sauce. There's a free candy jar on the counter that you can help yourself from after your meal!  The staff are all young, friendly, and professional. To the reviewer who mentioned a \"no strollers allowed\" vibe, I've seen plenty of parents in there with strollers and young kids, and it doesn't seem to be a problem with either the staff or the other customers."}
{"text":"sweet potato fries are the best i've ever had! Definitely a must if you decide to stop by, BUT the prices have drastically gone up and the portions of that cut down.   their milkshakes are okay, i've had the peanut butter one and it was too thick and heavy for my liking. cookies and cream was pretty good but most of the cookie was at the bottom and i had to finish it with a spoon, same goes for the mint chocolate chip but that one is my favourite.   i went back again recently after a month or two to see that their prices went up, which i guess was okay for me since i love their sweet potato fries, and i had a cookie dough milkshake, which sucked. it tasted like nothing and it was way too thick.   i would return but maybe not as often as before"}
{"text":"I am just a little bit obsessed with the Canadian burger and their sweet potato fries! The poutine is delish all the people that work here are super friendly good vibes here and a good selection of beer! A must try!"}
{"text":"While the burgers here are interesting and a good size, it was a bit too salty for my taste. The fries were burnt and soggy. The staff was friendly though so I'm willing to give this place another shot."}
{"text":"Love their poutine here. The gravy is amazing!! In the summer they have this cute little patio that sits probably 10 people. We also wanted to try their milkshakes which I have to say we're pretty good for the price."}
{"text":"I had a chicken burger when I went there, it was well-cooked, the fries were pretty decent too. The burger itself was pretty big though, I could barely finish it. But I would recommend this place to anyone who wants an alternative to fast food burgers."}
{"text":"My first visit to Burger Stomper was last friday. The sign outside read \"bacon Bleu burger\", my favorite! It was juicy, tasty, had plenty of crumbly Bleu and they certainly didn't skimp on the bacon. This burger was excellent! I had the fries and a beer with the burger, both excellent.  The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because I couldn't sit outside on their patio to enjoy my meal - no liquor license for the patio I was told. It was a beautiful evening and I had to sit inside, oh well."}
{"text":"If you don't eat beef then you might be out of luck when you go here.  We went there around 8pm on a Friday and they had run out of Chicken.  When you add Onion Rings to your combo, expect to get about 8 onion rings for the $5.49 extra that you pay.  Although the onion rings are big, most of it is batter.  Also, don't? go in with the intention of ordering the Secret Stomp ( the towering burger that is plastered on their site and reviews), because we were told they don't have that burger anymore.  The milkshakes are good.  The burgers can be messy to eat, so have the napkins ready."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how many times we have ordered from Burger Stomper and they've messed up our order. The foods good but not good enough to justify the consistently poor service. Most of the times they've just asked us to drive back up to The Danforth (always difficult to find parking) and pick up the missing or wrong item. They don't offer an explanation or refund or even a discount on your next visit. So next time, there just won't be a \"next visit\". There's enough specialty burger shops out there now. Just google one in the neighborhood. You'll find others...easily"}
{"text":"We have ordered from Burger Stomper several times a month and on more than one occasion (4 or 5 times) arrived home to find out they screwed up the order which meant a trip back. It seems ridiculous to have to unwrap everything before leaving to check that it's actually what we ordered!. Food isn't good enough to justify this crappy service. Am moving our gourmet burger business elsewhere"}
{"text":"SERVICE & GROUPS Went there with a party of 3 for lunch.  I thought it was pretty slow considering there was only one other person in the restaurant and 3 staff behind the counter.  It was not painfully slow, but I wanted to mention this because I question their ability to handle groups because I think this slowness would snowball and get slower.  The cashier seemed a bit aloof, like she was hipster and a tad too cool to be bothered with answering questions from non-regulars.  Not engaging, but I don't generally have high expectations for counter service.  They are big on promoting their proprietary plastic Burger Stomper device so you can stomp your own burgers at home.  It decorates the cash register area.    FOOD They claim The Stomper enables them to get a nice brown crust on the burgers when cooked on the griddle.  It does seem to get it more brown, but the results didn't wow me --- meaning it didn't markedly improve the flavour.  Given that their burger is the namesake, I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 because it didn't deliver on the hype.  The burgers were okay.  Had better in the GTA.  They are a thick puck patty, not skinny minnies like McDonald's.  Perfect for hockey loving Canadians!  Ha!    The Cheese Please was intriguing.  They smother it with so much cheese that a couple inches flood on the grill to create a crispy ring.  Put enough cheese on something and it's gonna be tasty.  Really fun, decadent idea.  Good size burger.  Would satisfy most people.  The burger is cooked all the way through; I will give them credit for not making it too dry when cooking it so much --- but it wasn't screaming moist and succulent.  Toppings seemed rather average and traditional.   Onion rings were tempura style.  Light and crispy, but hard for one person to eat in addition to a burger.  I feel like they need ketchup or their chipotle aioli sauce; they aren't stand alone good eats.  Caesar salad was over-dressed w/ traditional dressing.  Garlic breath for sure!  Not intended for those on a romantic date.  My friend said their shakes were average (but generous) and sweet potato fries were above average.  Didn't get them, but they do have Truffle Parmesan fries for gourmet folks.  Would I eat there again?  Maybe if someone else picked it or I worked/lived in the neighbourhood.  Not a destination restaurant.  AMBIANCE It's sort of confusing.  For a burger dive, I'd expect it to feel cozy to compliment the comfort food.  The decor reminded me of a hip Italian cafe, though.  It seemed very clean and new.  KIDS Fine to take kids there just because they'll get lost in the noise.  They don't really cater to children, but I other guests won't be terribly bothered by kids who can't sit still.  Burger sliders (aka \"Stompinis\") might be good for 2 kids to share.  PARKING I recommend taking TTC to Chester Station and walking a block.  The Danforth street parking is always slim pickings.  HANDICAP ACCESSIBLE On the ground floor only.  They have chairs so a wheel chair can pull up to a table.  The cashier counter is a bit high for a wheelchair.  The menu is posted on a wall in the dining area, so it is nice and visible from a wheel chair or a table in front."}
{"text":"So far, this is the best burger I've eaten in Greektown. There aren't many options, but this is the best one.  I ordered the \"Better Than the Other Guy\" bacon cheeseburger combo. It was a big burger, it was fresh and it was damn tasty. At $13, the price isn't too bad.  Burger Stomper seems to be a hit in the neighbourhood. Every time I pass at lunch or supper time by it looks busy."}
{"text":"Third time there. I ordered two small cheeseburger. It sucks.  The meat was overcooked that the bottom is black.  I don't like the food here, but they got super comfortable chair and it is close to where I live. I like go there to do some reading( I know sound awkward for a burger place), but their food is really not worth It."}
{"text":"Very kind service and a great bite. If a flavour bursting burger is what you're after, this is the place to go. You're paying a bit more but you are definitely getting your money's worth."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, yummy! Vegetarian burger paradise :)  Put together your own from all the goodies you can think of. Fresh, tasty, healthy!  Add some sweet potato fries and a drink too and you are good to go.  Don't continue reading this post, just step in to this great d√©cor and cool Burger Stomper :)"}
{"text":"Milkshakes looked amazing. Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to try one since they ran out of Nutella...a key ingredient. They did offer to make it without the Nutella,  but not sure it would taste the same.  I'll likely give them another chance, but for now they get a poor review from me."}
{"text":"My friends have been on a burger kick and decided they wanted to try this place out, so I tagged along.  I ordered the burger called \"Better Than the Other Guys\", onion rings and a bottle of Coke.  I received the onion rings first, heavy battered, but still pretty good, they had a Cajun type dipping sauce served with the rings which complimented them very well.  My burger arrived a short time after.  I had to send my first burger back due to pinkness in the meat, I don't like taking chances when it comes to ground beef.  My second burger (they made a completely new one which was nice) arrived about 7-10 minutes after I returned the first one and by that time most of the party I was with were finished their meals.  I ate the burger, it was very tasty, but also very salty.  I didn't feel the greatest that evening or the next morning, possibly due to sodium content.  I am not returning or recommending this restaurant to anyone I know"}
{"text":"Had a good burger and poutine here today.  I had the \"Canadian\" with peameal bacon, saut√©ed onions and cheddar.  It was a good burger although with sauce and tomatoes the bottom bun fell apart really easily.  The taste was great though.  I got the regular poutine and it had ample mozzarella cheese with lots  of gravy.  I prefer cheese curds but it was still good.  My wife had bacon cheeseburger sliders which she enjoyed.  The cashier was nice and one of the cooks dropped off our food so that was our service experience. No complaints - it's what I expected.  I should have got a milkshake, I will next time.  Overall, a good lunch and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good experience overall. Went with two buddies for dinner tonight.  The decor is great. It's got the exposed brick look going, and I've always loved that. Signage is well organized and aesthetically appealing. My only beef with anything decor related is the storefront sign, outdoors. It's kind of small and easy to miss, we actually did miss it at first, then had to back track.  The food was pretty good. I had a cheeseburger and poutine. The burger was good, I like that lettuce was nice and fresh, that's always a big plus to me. The burger itself was alright too. It was a little more cooked than I tend to prefer but still not bad. The poutine was surprisingly good. It wasn't what I'd call gourmet, but it was still tasty, and I enjoyed it.  The service was fine. All young people, I don't mind that. They were polite and the wait for the food was appropriate.  All and all a good experience, stop in for sure if you're in greek town."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon and gave this burger joint a try. The cashier was really great in helping decide which burgers would satisfy our craving. I did the secret stomper combo with fries while the wife did the cheeseburger combo with onion rings and a Greek salad. Everything was ready in less than 10 mins. The burger sizes are huge, as are the portions of fries/onion rings. Better yet, it tasted great. Despite the fact that I had a Groupon, I would definitely pay the full price for these burgers - completely worth it for what you get. I'll definitely be back to try the milkshakes as well. It was too cold outside to try one out this time, but looking forward to it on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Must Try: Signature Truffle Burger, Truffle Parm Fries   Rating: (7/10) Food, (8/10) Service, (7/10) Value, (8/10) Ambience, (8/10) Presentation, (9/10) Cleanliness  My Experience:    Came here with a coupon and an appetite for a burger. Ordered the Signature Truffle Burger, although the Secret Stomp, the Eggsodus and the Better than the Other Guy all sounded very appealing. Ordered fries and some milkshakes on the side cause, why not.   Overall the burger was good, the meat patty was the highlight of the burger, however it didn't necessarily blow me away. I would consider coming back and trying some of the other menu items, but made no striking mark that will keep me coming back again and again.   The seating area was fairly large, and the restaurant was quite clean. The service I received was great, no complaints there."}
{"text":"Really overrated! Was looking forward to having this after tasting Burgernator.   I ordered the sweet onion d burger with fries with a strawberry milkshake.  Service was timely and prompt.   The burger was super sloppy and salty and just overloaded with condiments. You know when you have a burger, you'd actually like to taste the meat. All I tasted was ketchup and mayo. Kinda turned me off. The fries were good.. just a bit salty.  The milkshake on the other hand was bomb.com! You earned an extra star because of it. But really, this place isn't that great. My mouth feels like I ate a spoonful of salt... meh."}
{"text":"Decent burger place, it's very pricey!  Got the truffle burger (which was amazing idea- truffle and burger=heavenly idea) but it wasn't thaaat flavorful.  The Greek fries were good too, nothing exceptional though.  All in all... 3/5. I won't bother coming again"}
{"text":"The bacon cheeseburger poutine is the best poutine I have ever had and I have had a LOT of poutine. A bit much for one man, it would be good to share. Had a couple burgers too pretty good but O you poutine."}
{"text":"Nouveau bar √† burger sur Greektown, le Burger Stomper propose une carte de burgers de toutes tailles et pour tous les go√ªts. A recommander absolument!  //New burger joint in Greektown, the Burger Stomper has a full menu of burgers of every sizes, try the tiny ones they are awesome! Definitely a place to go!"}
{"text":"This is not a gourmet burger place! Do not let the full store name fool you 'Burger Stomper Gourmet Burger & Milkshake Bar' cause it is a load of crock!  Had the cheese burger and swiss burger from here and my goodness it tasted like a fast food burger from McDonald's.  You can literally see the meat they use looks exactly like the meat from any fast food restaurant, small/thin/crap, they only claim it is 'gourmet' due to the special custom burger topping, it is perfume on a dead body to cover up the crap burger with toppings!  Just like other reviews, milk shake was decent, just revamp this place to a dessert place or something cause they can NOT make a good tasting 'burger'  Go to any bars on the Danforth, order a burger there and BAM that is what you call a real burger, size and taste as well as price, something they should consider doing and see for themselves what a real burger looks like.  I repeat, THIS IS NOT A GOURMET BURGER PLACE!"}
{"text":"Second time coming here, this time with a Groupon. Service was mediocre at best. Cashier was rude and even though the Groupon had no restrictions listed on it they said it doesn't apply to a bunch of things on the menu. Items are fairly pricey too. Atmosphere is nice but I would not come here again given there is much better (and cheaper) selection on the Danforth."}
{"text":"I was uber excited to come here after reading about this place on yelp and seeing the owners go on dragons den. However I was left pretty disappointed. I got the eggsodus burger with a fried egg and pesto sauce, and it was good. The pesto was great at cutting the greasiness of the burger, and made it very easy to finish. I was disappointed with the fries though, but the sweet potato fries my friend got was fried very nicely. I also got the cookies and cream milkshake, and found it ok. Not worth 4+ dollars in my opinion. I also tried my friend's nutella peanut milkshake and found it waaayy too thick and heavy, so not really worth the hype in the milkshake department. Although the burger was good, it wasn't exceptional enough for me to be like, \"wow, I must take my friends here.\" Considering that I paid $18 for a burger combo and large milkshake, I expected something truly exceptional and I found this place fell short. Overall, I probably won't go out of my way to visit here."}
{"text":"Fresh Delicious You don't get stuffed heavy feeling when you are done. Bun is light.  Fries are ok."}
{"text":"During Thursday night, I realize I crave for a burger and was really hungry and so this is a potential opportunity to go to the Burger Stomper which I neglected to over the months that it had been opened. And since I want to order take-out, I went to this place.   The atmosphere is really casual and always busy. However, If I ever had to dine-in, it might take longer since the place looks somewhat hectic. Also that a group came in and had to sit on a dirty table which the staff forgot to clean it.    Gourmet burger sliders (2 for $5) was the best thing I ever ate. I really love the chips complimenting it. The burger itself wasn't dry and was very consistent.   And poutine was decent albeit too much gravy and fatting in it. Also the fact that since I ordered take-out, it became somewhat soggy with the moisture and I did not really enjoy it. The gravy was good however but I almost felt that I had a heart attack afterwards. Although for around 5/6 bucks, its worth it.   I will definitively come back to try out their combos which I embarrassingly did not saw and the infamous Cheese Please Burger."}
{"text":"I only had their burger through Uber Eats, so it would be unfair to make comments about anything else. The burger and onion rings were really tasty with a relatively big portion. They food is a big greasy but that is more of a personal taste."}
{"text":"My experience seems to be very similar to other reviewers.  The experience as a whole was very pleasant. Nice clean establishment and friendly customer service.  The food was fine and fresh and nothing at all wrong with it.  That being said, the food just lacked something and I really can't say what it is. One reviewer said that, \"it didn't have that wow factor.\" I would hate using such a cliche and apologize to Burger Stomper for saying it, but it is true. The Cheese Please burger, onion rings, and Oreo milkshake were all good and prepared well but all lacked something. Maybe they needed a little more flavour or more high end ingredients. I can't say.  I do recommend going there and trying it out, there is nothing wrong with it and this just may be my personal tastes influencing my review but that's what I think about it."}
{"text":"They blacked out the milkshakes prices in marker, so I had no idea what the prices were. I was with my 4 year old so wanted to buy their \"kids size\" but whatever flavours I asked for they said I had to buy large. So why have a a \"kids size\"? Ended up buying the large because we really wanted the flavour. They were really rude and the milkshakes were meh. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, burger was solid, but it took a while to get our food. They were busy enough, but it wasn't packed either.  I've only been the once, which isn't a lot of data to go on.  Basically, it's what you'd expect for a slightly upscale burger chain. It's good, but it doesn't stand out from a crowd of other similar burgers. It wasn't a revelation, and there are several other burger places closer to my home that are better, IMO.  Still, it's better than most of the mega chains (McDonald's, Harvey's, A&W, etc.) in every way but speed. If you're in the area and you want a burger, this isn't a bad place to get one. Just don't expect to be stunned."}
{"text":"I liked the ambience here. Cool vibe. It was a very nice restaurant. I enjoyed the laid back house music. However my first impression of the service was dismal. The girl at the counter was frowny. I don't expect you to smile from ear to ear but I'm a paying customer who helps pay your pay cheque try to be a little more chipper. I hope I just caught her on a bad evening. On the other hand the other girls seemed more upbeat and cheerful. I think one of them should have switched onto cash instead.   The burger was great overall. The quality was wonderful and the bun was amazingly good and fresh. I ordered the spicy burger with the crispy jalapenos was a great touch. A little odd that my fries came out separately than the burger. But the fries were excellent. Hand-cut and yummy!  I smothered them with ketchup. I'm allowed to be unhealthy sometimes!  I like the way you get a number on your table which allows for you to relax and wait for food. The food is fresh and delicious.   Would I recommend it. Yes! I will go again. I'm hoping to move to this area. It's pretty funky!  Added note, the girl who frowned at cash seemed chipper later when she took my tray away. She must have been tired earlier. I added an extra star after this. I also tipped but probably good to keep \"tip talk\" quiet around customers."}
{"text":"What a BONUS that this amazing burger joint is in the area.  I'm so pleased to have finally said yes to my husband on coming here.  He is a burger kind of guy and have been trying to convince me to come here over 5 times.    WOW, hands down the best burger I've had compared to the more mainstream competitors.  The patty was so flavourful I can't even stop drooling writing this review.  I asked for extra onions and got a ton of it in my burger which made it even more delicious! The service was amazing and all of the staff were very friendly, one note I wanted to highlight was I really really really appreciated the small things such as them bringing our order to our table...oh the small things in life!"}
{"text":"I'm not a burger person, but I'm giving this place 4 stars which is very high. We ordered swiss melt and spicy jalapeno burger. Both were awesome. The patty is juicy and seasoned well. I'd say this is the best burger I've ever had (not that i get burgers often).   I find the prices very high. The only reason I came here is because I had a buytopia voucher, which is effectively $10 off. With that, the price is ok. I probably wouldn't pay $12 + tax for a burger combo, even if it's very good. The value is ok. I like how they don't cheap out on fries like so many places. The combo comes with a very generous portion of fries, and they were fried right.   If you feel like spending $10-$15 for a burger combo, this is the place to do it. For this price range, I'd much rather get a souvlaki plate in the nearby Greek restaurants. But that's my personal preference. If you love burgers, go here because even someone who doesn't usually get burgers recommend it (me)."}
{"text":"It's not often that I go out specifically to a burger joint, but I noticed Burger Stomper on Twitter and decided to take the plunge.    Came here on a Monday around 1:30PM to try out their burger and milkshake.  I had heard a lot about their milkshakes.  A large (ringing in at $6.25 including tax) is quite the splurge, but worth every penny IMHO.  And probably a good deterrence so that I am not having one everyday! Haha.  I opted for the CHEESE PLEASE burger - and boy was it a CHEESE burger.  The cheese ring that oozes out of the burger (see photo to truly appreciate how much cheese is in the burger) is definitely eye-catching though I must say that you sacrifice flavour for presentation here.  It tastes more like a chip, though in its defense it is very crispy!  The burger itself is quite juicy though the thin bun-bottom doesn't hold up against the grease.   The home fries are twice fried and hand cut daily and are pretty darn good.  It is also interesting to note that the restaurant is named after the owner's invention - the Burger Stomper which presses out perfect and uniform 6 oz. burgers every time.  The bonus is that there is a mini-stomper which presses out 2 oz. sliders, in the same perfect uniformity every time.  This \"apparatus\" took 5 years from conception to market and they will be appearing on this season's Dragon's Den so keep your eyes peeled!  I would definitely come back - I'm eyeing the Nutella Peanut Butter Shake!"}
{"text":"First impression, small cozy, got the signature big stomp, good burger, patty could have been thicker or it should been a double patty burger for the bread size and amount but it was filling. I also got a shake (cookies and cream)  it was alright, could been a thicker more creamer shake but it was tasty  I may or may not return, it's not something to return for"}
{"text":"Finally had the time to give this place a try after seeing it for so long on Uber eats and some friends having it.  Tried the spicy jalape√±o burger with a classic poutine.  It was fairly tasty.. My girlfriend had the better than the other guy burger and it was alright. I'd defiantly say go for it and try it if it is your first time."}
{"text":"Stopped in at Burger Stomper last night on the Danforth to take dinner out and back to our house. The first thing I noticed was that it doesn't have that \"stay here and eat vibe\" and, even more so, it has that \"don't bring a baby here\" vibe. It also has a less-obvious but still relevant \"lactose intolerants steer clear\" vibe. Thank God I'm not, eh?   We had an order of sweet potato fries, a poutine and the \"Cheese Please\" burger.   The sweet potato fries were ok, run-of-the-mill deep fried sweet potato. The poutine- meh- shredded mozzarella is not a replacement for cheese curds, ever. I'm pretty sure it's one of the ten commandments, written right there on those two stone scrolls, si?   Anyway....the Cheese Please burger was ri-goddamn-diculous. It had so much cheese on it that I didn't even find the meat until, like, way late. It was good- not cooked as much as I like it, but that's my psychosis and probably not yours.   What we didn't splurge on was a milk shake, which they are supposedly known for. Next time, next time.  The prices were much better than many of their gourmet burger joint counterparts, though, which is great. And their staff are super friendly and helpful.   We'll be back for a meal with less cheese. That burger needs a warning."}
{"text":"Ordered the Greek burger and paid 2 bucks extra for onion rings. The burger was dry and way overcooked. The onion rings were also overcooked in oil that was too hot. They were very hard. Will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Came here to try the poutine--it's actually quite good.  BUT.  The gravy is burnt. You can taste and smell the burnt gravy. That's a rookie mistake, as it relates to poutine--especially in an ultra-competitive burger/poutine market like Toronto. Kind of spoiled what otherwise could have been a stellar dish."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I stepped foot into Burger Stompers on Danforth. I was amazed at the cleanliness, the atmosphere and the super freindly staff. We discovered that we can actually eat there cause they have gluten free burgers and buns.  I was super suprised at the size of the burgers that came. The onion rings are now one of my favourites next to Harvey's.  Only downfall is it's very expensive.  I would still stay I highly recommend and revisit this place in the future."}
{"text":"I love burgers; if there would be no effect on my hips, I would have one everyday.   A Yelp Event this afternoon brought me to Burger Stomper and gave me the opp to try a few of the burgers that are offered on BS' menu. I found all the burgers to be pretty good; they were not overly greasy and the buns were crunchy.  When working at Greenwood/Danforth, the Danforth was my go-to place for meals, but haven't given this street much love in the last couple of years. I'll definitely be back to check out BS again. It's primarily a burger joint, but they also have milkshakes (with pretty funky flavors).  A four star here -"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best burgers I've had in Toronto. I'm sad I didn't get around to going here earlier. I got the truffle burger. It has the juicy, awesome beef patty, mushrooms, truffle aioli, bacon, and some kind of \"truffle cheese\" the menu tells me. The truffle aroma was fairly mild, but present (they obviously aren't going to shave a real truffle for $12, so don't expect that, it's more like a splash of truffle oil). The beef and bacon were both perfectly cooked. My favorite part is that I'm watching my starch consumption so I ordered it without a bun and they took it upon themselves to wrap the burger in giant lettuce leaves. That was awesome. Mind you I'm a knife and fork guy so I ripped off the leaves and ate them as a side salad, but it was much appreciated. The food was quick to come from the kitchen, the staff were friendly, the place was clean, and the price was in line with the competition, maybe even a bit cheaper. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"the bacon and cheeseburger poutine was sooo yummy. i was afraid that i would be too greasy but honestly it was just right. the hint of vinegar really  made the difference! im definitely coming again when im in the area"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch, I love a good burger!   When I was walking here I actually passed by it, I guess I was not really paying attention. However, this was a foreshadow of what was to come.   I was expecting something more, I got the jalape√±o burger. It was a little spicy but mostly plain, there was nothing about the burger or fries that made it stand out.   This was a very average burger and just like I walked pass by this place on the way there, the food pass by me un-noticed."}
{"text":"Burgers are excellent. Meat is top notch, buns are good but not great. Standard toppings. The sweet potato fries seem to be dredged in a light batter to make them crispier--lovely. The onion rings were disappointing because they were all batter. Also subtract one star for calling itself a Burger AND SHAKE joint and having no malted shakes on the menu."}
{"text":"So I've tried out this new-ish place a few times now. I've had the Cheese Burger, the Bacon Cheese Burger (it WAS better than the other guy, btw), and the poutine. If I could I'd give the place 3.5 stars, as it's better than a 3, but not quite as good as a 4 in my humble, admittedly not-a-burger-conneseur opinion. What it does well: obviously fresh, not frozen, juicy burgers that are flavourful & not laden with seasoning. Good fries. The food you get is more than enough. Decent vibe to the whole place, and friendly service. What I didn't like: the poutine was a bit of a disaster: the cheese didn't taste like cheese curds, and there was way too much gravy (\"french fries soup\"), and the burger buns are way too soft & white-wonderbread-y. For the quality of the burger it seems wrong to me to put it on such a crappy bun. I'll go back though."}
{"text":"Found the burger here decent. I wouldn't go out of my way for this place but if you want to hit up as many good burger joints as possible put this on your list.  The onion rings and milkshake were really good. Also very filling at a good price."}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant 5 stars for the owners beautiful spirits. They don't talk about their kindness but I know for a fact that they regularly have fed the homeless in our neighbourhood. They were very kind to Billy Jeanes, a leprechaun of a man. He passed away on October 6, 2017. I suggest if you go in to give a donation to the restaurant, in Billy's name, and others in need. Thank you for always looking out for Billy."}
{"text":"Edit MAY 2018: they finally improved the delivery service! The burgers arrive in good condition and hot... finally! I'd order again now.  The stomper sauce is really good. Keep going!   Disappointed!! Never order again... the burger arrived in a worst condition! I couldn't even eat it... the bread was full of sauce (so was the box and everything!)    I remove all the stars! Probably the luck of the beginner.  We'll find another burger place."}
{"text":"Just happened to run across this restaurant when we were exploring the neighborhood our condo was in. The smell drew me in and after looking at menu it was definitely the right choice for dinner. There burgers were very good and at an affordable price. They also had fries, onion rings and milk shakes that all looked good."}
{"text":"Cheap and good pretty much sums up Danforth's Burger Stomper. Will it blow your mind? Maybe for sure, maybe not. But it is hard to complain about size or holier-than-thou foodie qualities when much of the burgers are UNDER $10.  Some stuff, like the spicy jalapeno burger ($7.99) are good choices. Others like the Greekburger ($7.99--more like a Greek salad stuffed in a burger if you ask me), are duds. As well, they got milkshakes and just three poutine types on the board. Bacon cheeseburger poutine ($9.99), essentially a poutine combined with bacon cuts and ingredients of a basic cheeseburger (minus the bun), is a greasy wonder comparable to something you'd get at a Smoke's Poutinerie.  It's not a full-service diner, though some alcohol is served, and on slow periods service can get too laid back. Otherwise Burger Stomper is a decent choice for a quick gourmet bite.  {TTC: Chester. Subway. Station.}"}
{"text":"The big stomp is a burger stuffed in between 2 grilled cheese bun sandwiches.  My son loves it.  I got the swiss mushroom vegetarian burger this time and last time I got the blue cheese burger.  The fries are fresh cut but needed salt. We went here with a Groupon so it was reasonable but the regular prices are quite expensive.  The beef and veggie patties are quite small for the price."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Huge fries with your order (we share between the two of us) and tasty beef burgers. Usually get the Swiss melt with shrooms, bbq and mayo. So good.   Fries are fresh and tasty along with the great milkshakes. Def recommend."}
{"text":"We went when they opened and the quality has gone down since. Their burgers are so packed full of condiments that this is NOT a great place to meet for a business lunch. Which is too bad because it is close to my office and fast and relatively cheap.  The last time I went there was literally no place to sit. It was high noon and the entire seating was taken over by school kids. Some 12 kids all sharing one order of fries and the odd coke. What is that 8 dollars? So I had to take it to go, they didn't seem to care that a 30 dollar order walked out the door, and never will I step foot in there again."}
{"text":"3.5 / 5  A pretty solid burger place, although it doesn't really have that \"wow\" factor that some places have.  I ordered the swiss mushroom burger with fries and a drink, which i think totalled to about $14.  Somewhat standard pricing for a gourmet burger place, and the portions were good so I was satisfied.  The burger itself was a tiny bit on the dry side but was fresh and tasty, although the taste didn't exactly blow me away.  The fries were also pretty good, definitely tastier than your average fries you get at most fast food places.  The service was quite good, especially the fact that my burger was made in what seemed to be less than 10 minutes or so.  The girl working the cash register was friendly and attentive, and the whole place had a good overall vibe.  The decor was pretty cool too with it's exposed bricks and wooden tables.  Overall this was a good visit, not outstanding by any means but definitely better than most burger places."}
{"text":"The burgers are good but it is way over priced. Almost 40.00 for burgers, onion rings and milkshakes."}
{"text":"This place made be violently ill with food poisoning. I ordered a cheeseburger. Right from the get-go there were a lot of red flags, like; \"hmmm these pickles are ice cold\", and \"hmmm, is this really cheese? I don't remember cheese being this runny.\" And most importantly, \"why is this thing leaking so much? Must be the excessive amount of \"stomp\" sauce.\"  Also, you have to check in on Facbeook to use their wifi, which at first I thought was annoying, but now serves as proof that they're responsible for the horrendous vomiting I endured all night last night and into the morning.  Despite the red flags, I ate the burger because I was hungry and I had somewhere to be. I've eaten at \"gourmet burger\" places in Toronto, since they're all over. Big Smoke is delicious. Burger's Priest, out of this world. THIS place tasted like a glorified Big Mac, only not as reliable. This was not a gourmet burger.   I checked in at 7:21 on FB. By 10pm I was with some friends and made them know I wasn't feeling so well. I thought it was indigestion. But as time passed, I recognized that feeling as: \"oh no, that supposed burger place served me something absolutely rancid.\"  I rushed home and spent all night hovering the toilet. It's been over 24 hours now, and I still have stomach pains.  If that's something you want to experience, then please, enjoy the Burger Stomper.   If not, I recommend you eat LITERALLY anywhere else."}
{"text":"Over priced for what you get.   The burger looked like a meatball in the middle of a large loaf of bread.  It was over cooked and I was underwhelmed.  Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great little burger joint in the area. Got a spicy jalapeno burger. Just the right amount of kick. Nice sauce. Fresh bun. Juicy patty. What else do you need for under $10. Staff is friendly. Clean area. Will try the poutine on the next visit. For the price, this place is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Best Burger place in the city! Always fresh and always great! This is not my 1st time here, they have never disappointed me in any way! Staff is always nice and willing to explain what's on the burger or fries?"}
{"text":"Seeing the last review talking about \"huge portions\" is a real shock. Something pretty drastic has changed since that last review. We made an order via just eat and got utterly robbed for our dollars worth.   I'll start with the basics. Two burgers, 1 order of fries and 1 order onion rings plus 2 milk shakes (the shakes alone were $12 before taxes) plus a 10% automated tip that amounted to $53.35 -- you read that right.  The worst part about all of this was the portions for the fries and onion rings. There were a total of 9 rings for a whopping $5.74. The amount of fries wasn't very impressive either but they were a little cheaper. ALSO we got suckered by this next detail, apparently paying more for a side order gives you the same amount as if you got a regular combo...well except it technically costs more for less because you don't get a drink. (We actually called shocked by the portions to discuss and got that gem) the staff was sympathetic but you got the feeling they might have a bad time for doing anything about it. As \" they didn't price the items out/ decide the portions either.\"   Moving on to the positives -- the quality -- everything  tasted great! My grilled chicken BLT was fantastic although they forgot the guacamole ($1.49) extra. The  few fries I had were delicious. My partners meal was good too but she wasn't crazy about her 9 onion rings. Both the salted caramel and skors shakes were tasty. Kinda small for $6 plus tax but again at least it tasted good.  This might have been a 3 Star order on quality alone, if we didn't need to drag that $1.49 back kicking and screaming from them after over a half hour of calls, and dealing with just eat customer service.  All of this combined put a pretty bad spin on what should have been a pretty decent junk foodie dinner. There was really nothing wrong with the food itself."}
{"text":"Alright, I came back today and they did it.  Three words- FIVE STAR WORTHY!  Brought a Burger Stomper virgin here today since he loves burgers but have yet to check this place out.  Walked up to the counter to be greeted by a friendly smile.  This time, I knew exactly what I was getting- the CHEESE BURGER!  As I waited for my friend to decide, the same manager/ owner (probably the latter) as last time greeted us and then to my surprise, recognized me from my previous review!  That's impressive!  He offered to buy us our meals this time... even MORE impressive![1]    Cheese Please Burger: $8.50 (5/5 stars) I promised myself to come back to try this, and I am glad I did.  Best tasting simple, yet original cheese burger ever!  When I say \"simple\", I mean that it embraced the regular cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickle, etc.  But it's \"original\" because where else will you find a JUICY burger with a giant cheddar crisp that extends flat out beyond the the size of the burger?? (Please refer to my picture if you don't understand.)  It's like a spaceship... or a flying saucer... or the ring around Jupiter... you can probably even play ultimate frisbee with that piece of cheese!  The only minor criticism I have is that when I picked up the burger, there was a some grease  that the bun was sort of soaking up at the bottom.  But, I cannot NOT expect any grease when I ordered an ultimate CHisbee burger... (If you're one to complain about a little bit of grease, just get the classic burger and add cheese).  Mediterranean Burger: $7.75  My friend got this one, and unfortunately I did not try it.  But by the way he described to me and how he ate it, probably 4-5 stars.  He was a happy camper.  We were lucky and got a sample of a hash that they're are possibly adding to the menu as a side.[2]  It was a simple potato mashed and mixed with generous chunks of bacon, sweet peppers, onions, and cheese.  It was good, but I personally would have liked some heat and smaller bacon chunks.  Service: (5/5 stars) Haven't disappointed yet.  Keep it up!  Since I got my burger for free, I left a $5 bill in the tip jar.  But really, the whole experience deserved more.  Unfortunately, I only had my debit with me.  As much as I really wanted to, I didn't get a milkshake and try their sweet potato fries (which looked so good) this time 'cause I was watching my girly beach figure.  Oh well, only means I'm coming back![3]  I already have a line up of friends waiting for me to take them here haha.  [1] If Stomper staffs are reading, Thank you SO much!  We genuinely appreciate it. [2] I would love to see something other than french fries and onion rings as sides... maybe fried pickles(!!!!!)?  As a nutritionist, I would suggest something a bit lighter and not deep fried just to add a bit of contrast to the menu.  Perhaps a simple salad, corn and chickpeas, slaw, or a GIANT portobello.  Yum! [3] I promise!  **I may have to challenge Burger Stomper to Superwoman's Superburger! (Yes, I also make them and not just eat them haha) Dare me!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had, great service. Little wait (not long) on our milkshakes so the server upsized the shake size."}
{"text":"I came in to Burger Stomper from Square Boy down the street, the staff was friendly and patient. Where it is a little bit more expensive than the Square Boy burger joint down the street, the quality of the burger is unparalleled. The patty isnt pre-made or frozen, it's ground beef pressed into patty form, awesome. Next time you are in the area i highly recommend you grab a hamburger."}
{"text":"The fries were great. The onion rings were great (crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside). The service was great. The burgers? Meh. Loved the brioche bun and the crispy lettuce, but the patty was pretty flavourless and that's what it really comes down to for me. Wanted to like it more than I did, but not a bad place and I wouldn't mind coming again."}
{"text":"This gourmet burger and milkshake bar JUST opened to the public yesterday. And though it used to be an old magazine store (sorry..had a soft spot for that store even though it moved down the street), this is a welcome and needed addition to the Danforth nabe.  *Note: I did get a free burger  *Note 2: it won't stop me from having an opinion. *Note 3: Cash only   VIBE  Really casual and fun. Modern. And I say this because the only other modern place on the strip is Pizzeria Libretto. It's got remnants of a barn in here with the woods that they've used and leaving the exposed brick wall exposed. I'm so glad that they left the front floor to ceiling window and put a bar there because it's the perfect spot to people watch while chowing down. Even on their first day, the place was pretty busy. Lots of families here and the back booth enables you to speak to your neighbours. The Danforth hood is so friendly. They just need to be provoked a little. :)   The owner, Nick, is really nice. He's excited about his business and he's going to be on Dragon's Den on April 25.to promote his new product (which I'll discuss below). I'm really not trying to sound like an infomercial here but it's cool. How many people do you know that go on Dragon's Den? Anyways...  I ATE  I had the \"Cheese Please\" (would you expect anything less of me?). Not only does it have lots of gooey cheese laden inside of the burger, there is a SKIRT of fried cheese surrounding the perimeter of the bun. Not for those going for heart surgery anytime soon. It has your typical ingredients on top of it but let's talk about the meat. Everything is ground daily (pick up at 5 a.m. for fresh beef) and then grinded with a burger stomper, a burger press that makes patties or sliders. This will be promoted on Dragon's Den and it retails in the store for $29. SMART idea. I don't know any other burger joint in the city doing this. The burger is just as you want: greasy, gooey, messy and satisfying. BUT it needs more flavour. A little bit more pepper or seasoning and BAM!, you're in repeat business!   Other burgers reminded me of a cross between Burger's Priest, Holy Chuck and Lick's. They have a turkey burger here (mmm) and the popular one seems to be their version of a bacon burger called \"What The Other Guy Is Having\" (forgive me if this name is wrong...going off of memory and their site is up not yet).  They also have one with an egg on top. Burgers ran from about $7 to $9.  Your sides are typical -- fries, onion rings,poutine.   Honestly, the burger is enough. The sides are big portions but I was able to sample some onion rings and if you're having a craving, it will hit the spot. But again, not a lot of flavour. Needs more salt. I gave the feedback.    I will come back for the milkshake. They have a nutella one and a berry cheesecake one. Between this place and the A&W opening near my house, I've come to the realization, I'll never have a remote 6-pack. I'm trying to deal with this. Milkshakes are $4. And the cute part: they have one for couples at $7.50 (errr...) but how very Sandra D. of them.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  This joint is making the Danforth a place you want to \"stomp\" to. Whaa Whaa. More flavour and they're good. Plus, their seating is what a casual joint should strive for. It's a good mix and I have a feeling they'll be popular. I'm excited to see what new places open up given the popularity Libretto has done for the Danny."}
{"text":"The big joke about these so-called, \"gourmet\", burger joints is there isn't anything gourmet about them. What they make is no different when we ourselves make burgers at home. To be called gourmet one would expect exotic garnishes or ingrediants. They have neither. Though price wise they are decent their quality is no different than a McDonald's.   At least with a Big Mac we know what to expect. Here, the meat tastes different from week to week from greasy to dried out. When we add the sides (fries, onion rings etc...) it can make a super full meal for one but at the price point of two. Some people like thick shakes and others prefer runny shakes. They tend towards the runny side and their shakes aren't the only thing that runs. The cook that day wiped his nose on his short black T-shirt sleeve without using his hands. Eww GRoss!!!  Seating only favours 1-2 per table and they frown on moving 2 tables together for a party of 4."}
{"text":"The patties are not house made, so they are thin and dry. I had to put a lot of hot sauce on my cheeseburger just to make it not taste like a plain bun. The place is clean and the staff are friendly. Decent selection of tall cans, I had a Shock Top beer with my burger, which was a nice treat. $12 for a meal with a drink, not bad, but next time I would just get the sweet potato fries or onion rings as the burger does not meet my standards."}
{"text":"I had the better than the other guy burger (basically a bacon cheeseburger) along with a classic poutine and a mint & chocolate shake. The burger and shake were both amazingly delicious. The poutine however was only average. Service is quick and friendly. A great addition to the neighbourhood! I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"What happened to the old burger stomper? Little details have been deteriorating....they no longer carry interesting ciders or much range of drinks...fewer milkshake options...today in our takeout I got home to find they gave us \"sliders\" that were just regular patties cut in half on small buns. I ordered a blue cheeseburger...no blue cheese :(. Not sure we'll keep going here."}
{"text":"A must stop for a heart attack inducing Big Stomp burger with grilled cheese buns. It's exactly how it sounds - super greasy, messy and is great for sharing but can be a bit overwhelming. We split that with an order of the Smoky Bacon Poutine which we weren't fans of - there was just too much going on with the ingredients and the fries were quick to get soggy.   One thing we couldn't get enough of were the milkshakes! We both got the cookies and cream shakes with nutella and skor bits which was chocolate paradise!  The food here isn't cheap and set us back around $30 which isn't really worth it imo, but I'd definitely come back for more milkshakes!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had a $40 voucher to try Burger Stomper, which is located just steps away from The Big Carrot in the Danforth. So we went just after the Friday lunch rush. We got a nice table. Typical burger bar decor, clean.  The big menu is on the wall, and you order at the cash and then they bring the food to the table. It was quiet when we arrived, and the friendly server at the cash answered all our questions patiently.  My friend ordered the truffle burger combo. The burger comes with truffle aioli and truffle-flavoured Havarti cheese. It was billed as \"very truffly,\" but according to my friend, it was only mildly truffly. She enjoyed it, though. Combos come with excellent fresh-cut fries and a can of pop or bottle of water.  I splurged and got the Secret Stomper combo. It is a Chef's Choice burger. You are guaranteed a minimum of 2 patties. You specify the toppings you do not want, and then the chef gets creative with the rest. I omitted mustard and relish, but was open to anything else, especially spicy. My burger had 2 regular patties, PLUS 2 additional slider patties, I think (the sliders are half the size of the regular - so a total of 3 patties, essentially). It had a ton of crispy bacon (easily 6-8 strips), 2 types of cheese, some sauce (either the Stomp or secret sauce, I couldn't tell you which since I was a first-timer), onion ring bits, deep-fried jalapenos, pickled jalapenos, and pickles. I don't recall any tomato or lettuce, which was fine. This burger was all about the meat, which was perfectly and aggressively seasoned. There was no way I could have had room for any grilled-cheese as buns.  We also split an order of onion rings, a very generous portion. The batter was tasty and thick. I would have preferred them just a touch crispier, as they got a little chewy over time. They come with a nice dipping sauce. They are definitely worth a try.  I will definitely come back whenever I shop in this area."}
