{"text":"My friend took me there for my first Pilipino food experience. It was great. The owner served us herself, the food was delicious. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went here for a party with a filipino martial arts school. From the amazing service from Mayette herself and the array of delicious food available (especially the fried chicken and vegetarian spring rolls), it was probably one of the better filipino restaurant experiences I had. The karaoke machine deserves a medal - all the strange songs hidden away on it made my sides hurt laughing the entire night (\"My dill goes MMM\" still sends me into fits). I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I made the epic trip out to Scarbarough to eat the best traditional Pilipino brunch in Toronto. I ate until I wanted to lie down and sleep. The food is unreal."}
{"text":"Mayettes is like the best aunt/mom/sister you can ever have or wish you had!  She cooks from the heart and it shows in the quality and flavour of the food served.  From the Filipino spring rolls to the complicated and everso delicate care-care dish, each is made traditionally and with so much TLC.  Most people order and take out, but if you have time, eat in and enjoy the company of others while watching filipino movies.  It's simple comfort food.   Price is affordable!"}
