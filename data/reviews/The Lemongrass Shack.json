{"text":"This place catered at my work today.

I have celiac disease and the girl helping was very knowledgeable- she even knew about cross contamination and helped guide me to the right choice! 

I had the vegan curry- it was amazing!  I love coconut curry and I was so happy to be able to eat this today.

Great light flavor."}
{"text":"First time trying Cambodian food... I love Thai food so the owner suggested that I try the coconut curry with chicken. IT IS FANTASTIC!!!!

I'm not crazy about the papaya salad, but I'll just move it aside. 

The portion size is HUGE (for a lunch) and there is lots of sauce, which is the best part!!!

Thank you Lemongrass Shack! Job well done."}
{"text":"Both my wife and I ate here when visiting the Chinese festival and got sick as dogs. We ate chicken or at least that's what they claimed it was. I have always been reluctant to eat off these roach coaches, but this one looked pretty nice buyers beware don't let a good-looking trailer fool you stay away from this one"}
{"text":"This food truck came to my office complex today and DID NOT disappoint. I got the chicken curry and it was delicious! I hope the property management company has you guys out again!! YUM!"}
{"text":"This food is the bomb.com!! I eat at this food truck as much as I can when it comes by. My favorite type of food is Asian food and when Polo comes by he hooks it up with that Cambodian coconut chicken curry! I've had everything on his food truck and NOTHING disappoints!"}
{"text":"I am a curry snob, super picky ! Like my favorite curry is from either Guyana or Trinidad. OMG The Shrimp Curry from Lemongrass Shack is now on that list ! Amazing flavors. My husband had the Cambodian tacos and loved them. Next time I will also get another side of the lemongrass salad it was  super light & refreshing ! You MUST check out their schedule and go ! I will drive far distances for some more of that curry !!"}
{"text":"First tried this place about a month ago and ever since we have been hooked. We go to the power ranch farmers market every Wednesday. The sausage plate is awesome, the lemongrass chicken is delicious and the best of all is the coconut curry chicken. If you ever see the lemon grass shacktruck you should check it out Cambodian food is awesome"}
{"text":"Excellent service tasty eats. I added heat to the curry over lemongrass chicken mmmm combined with the papaya salad and Thai iced tea couldn't go wrong. I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Ugh this place is so good! They were at the Asian festival and were the only ones handing out samples! I was pretty hesitant to try a sample but I did and I'm so happy I tried it! I ended up getting the chicken curry TWICE! Best portion I've ever gotten from a food truck and the price was just right. Service was excellent. Until we meet again!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly chef. Got the sausage and beef stew! Both were amazing. Well definitely be back. They are in Gilbert every Wednesday."}
{"text":"they came to my work today.  i got the two item combo with salt and pepper beef and lemongrass sausage.  straight up nasty.....your beef has a ton of grizzle and is overcooked....the sausage is just gross and i love sausage........i do not recommend these people at all.    gross!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Food Truck! I have never tried Cambodian food, but am a huge fan of Thai and Vietnamese, and since it is geographically in the middle of the two, I figured I was in for a treat. The owner allowed me a sample of their lemongrass cured sausage (soooooooo delicious!) and said they had recently added coconut curry (w/ chicken) to their menu. So that is what I ordered. It was phenomenal. Scrumptious actually. I washed it all down with a can of icy cold thai iced tea. I look forward to them returning to our offices for another heaping helping of great customer service and yummy food."}
{"text":"I tried them for the first time at my church tonight! I was so excited they had a vegan option! I had the vegan plate which was SOOOOO amazingly good! Also, try the roasted coconut water... there's bits of coconut chunks in it and it was deliciously refreshing! I'm a forever customer!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Cambodian food and they have definitely set the bar high. I loved the coconut curry chicken. Very good favors and nice large portions. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Definitely recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"My fiancée love the Lemongrass Shack! They have come to our apartment complex for food truck night a couple of times and we are always so excited to see them on the calendar! Yellow curry is sooooo good and my fiancée loves the Lemongrass plate! Quality made food that does not skimp on portions. Yummy Thai iced tea! The people that work the truck are very very nice. Can't wait till they come back to Alta Midtown!"}
{"text":"The curry. Oh my gawd the curry. It's so so SO GOOD! I can't get enough of Lemongrass' food. Definitely need to check them out if you have not yet."}
{"text":"The Lemongrass Shack was one of the food trucks available at the Asian Festival this year. They were giving out free samples which was such a good way to get people interested in their different dishes for sale. I tried a sample of the coconut curry chicken which was excellent. I ultimately ended up getting their special \"limited time only\" Cambodian beef stew plate. The plate included a bowl of the stew and several scoops of rice for $10. 

It was served super boiling hot. I did wait a few minutes to eat it but even after waiting, the first bite was so temperature hot it burned my tongue and the roof of my mouth a bit. The taste was savory and a bit sour, a little reminiscent of Filipino sinigang. It had hearty chunks of tender beef and stewed Thai eggplant. 

Service was friendly. They accept credit card, cash and check. 

Overall it was a good meal and I was full after eating it. If I had to try another dish I would indulge in that tasty chicken coconut curry next!"}
{"text":"I don't get tired Cambodian food very often at all to speak of but I happen to be at Chandler Regional Medical Center because I wasn't feeling well I got out early in the morning about 1 a.m. and I discovered that what I was hungry there was a Cambodian street food trailer in the parking lot and so I decided to stop and check it out I just had some of the best Cambodian food I think I've had well living in the valley at this little place called The lemongrass Shack

Seems to go everywhere I had a moment to speak with the owner and he was a nice guy and even gave me a discount on a full dinner plate with a 3 meat combo which turned out to be very very good the thing I like the most about it was the beef and chicken I'm not too partial to sausage but they made it in a way that I can still eat it and it was very good I have to say for a $15 plate it's well worth it"}
{"text":"By far the BEST food truck I've ever had and maybe the BEST Asian food I've ever had!! I ate the Coconut Curry Chicken and it was to die for. The curry had the perfect combination of sweet and spicy. I have never tasted anything like it. It comes on a bed of white rice and a salad pickled in lime juice on the side. It was so good that I found myself licking the plate after the food was gone. Please please please try this truck. You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Lemongrass shack is always nailing it on the flavors!  If you enjoy bold flavors and healthy eating you owe it to yourself to hit up the shack! He always creating new dishes, there is something for everyone! Come hungry!"}
{"text":"I've had the chance to try majority of their dishes. My favorite was the yakisoba. The owner is super cool! Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"My first time trying Cambodian food is a success!  I asked for the most authentic dish and the young lady recommended the Cambodian beef stew.  It is delicious and has a good kick to it.  Maybe a little spicier than normal folks can handle but perfect for me.  I also got the Thai tea.  Not sure what's in it, but it tastes like tea mixed with an Italian soda.  Almost more of a dessert drink.  Interesting flavor.  I liked it.  The staff (young lady as cashier and, I'm assuming owner as chef) were very friendly.  The lady sitting at the table across from me had the lemongrass chicken and said it was very flavorful but not spicy.  I think this place is a winner!"}
