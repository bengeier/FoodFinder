{"text":"This is my first time here.  Great customer service, fast, and delicious Indian food!  I really hope they open one up on the west side of Cleveland!!"}
{"text":"The food is consistently excellent and I'm always amazed at how friendly the staff is.  I work nights so I usually get there kind of late and in some places the quality and the service are slightly different at a later hour, but not here.  Always super nice and professional!"}
{"text":"You have to go to Choolaah!  You will be be so glad that you did!  Whenever my family visits Cleveland we always go to eat here, my husband and son insist upon it!  Even if we have a hotel room across town, we don't mind the drive so that we can eat here.   I love Indian food, and this place does not disappoint!   It is so good to have a fast-food type of restaurant with healthy, varied menu.  My only wish is that they had a drive through.  One day maybe..."}
{"text":"Soooooo good! Everything is so fresh and flavorful! I really like that you can see into the kitchen area--you can see that everything is prepared on the spot from good ingredients. The veggie croquettes were delightful. They were hearty, full of texture, and perfectly crunchy. I highly recommend and would head back in an instant!"}
{"text":"Was very impressed with decor and even the food the first few days after it opened. However, the last 2 times i have visited the quality of food has clearly deteriorated. I really hope they can maintain a consistent level of quality and the taste of the food. Their menu is quite limited and feel it is extremely important to maintain quality and consistency to succeed."}
{"text":"Have been addicted to their chicken tikka masala now. And their biryani was really awesome. I love the raisins they put in rice. But actually my personal fav is their chocolate truffle. A must try!"}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, and really tasty! I loved the paneer and the curry sauce was on point. Great idea for quick Indian food."}
{"text":"Great flavors! Will return. Had the lamb meatball sandwich- absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Choolaah is the best Indian BBC around (get the mango lasse and wash your hands at the Jazz hand station)"}
{"text":"It's not bad considering it's fast Indian food. Need to satisfy a craving in a pinch? Come here. Not exactly my cup of chai, but not bad."}
{"text":"Great customer service! I recommend the mango smoothie type drink they sell. It's fantastic! Plus, I adore the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I like it... I really really like it... Different concept for an Indian restaurant, good flavors and awesome service. Amazing ambiance and really clean. Hope this continues..The chai could be much better.. was disappointed with it.."}
{"text":"Amazing! The flavors and atmosphere are great!  give it a try! The chicken ticka mashala is great! I go there alot ... they also have paddling right up front for veterans!  These are going to take off like Chipotle!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is pretty cool and new age. Think of it like the chipotle of indian food and you'll know what to expect. They have one of those new auto beverage dispensers and a cool hand shower/wash station. The employees in general are professional, nothing more, nothing less. The food is very consistent and pretty good tasting. It's in between fast food and restaurant food, just like chipotle. Its a cool new place to try as there are not many quick indian food places I can think of nearby."}
{"text":"Glad to see Indian food innovated in an amazing manner. No doubts the owners of this restaurant have poured lot of money into this unorthodox venture of Indian food. This place is a must visit if you crave for Indian food in USA."}
{"text":"My order was charged for a green sauce which was never provided and naan was burnt.Very little raita given with any of the dishes and drinks like mango lassi are half filled. They charge you for condiments like raita, which is like McDonald's charging you for ketchup. Raita is filled half way in the plastic cups as they know customers will come back for more kinda like getting a dime size of ketchup on a burger. The manager is extremely rude and not open to suggestions or customer feedback. This place is the McDonald's for Indian food and the manager compares it to a higher end resturaunt. He claims to have the best chickens used ....Very untrue it's not organic or grass fed at all. Basically they have taken fried meatballs and label them different names depending on the sauce provided. It's more of a ripoff for your money since they provide very tiny quantities especially rice. I will go to Taj India Palace which serves authentic Indian food with great customer service and healthy sized options where the food is prepared fresh and tastes amazing. Perhaps the manager at choolah needs to rethink and take courses in customer service rather than behaving like he is a pretentious maharaja wannabe prince"}
{"text":"Best place to eat in Mosaic District , we love the place to visit with family n friends"}
{"text":"This was about exactly what I expected. Good, quick, inexpensive food. Not incredibly authentic but extremely enjoyable.  I got the chickpea masala. There were a solid handful of non-meat options. He got the lamb meatball barbecue. I got samosas, he got naan. We bot ate for less than 20 dollars.   The samosas were great. Crispy, flakey crust, flakey interior. His naan was also excellent--bubbly, buttery and chewy. He enjoyed his lamb. I made the mistake of underestimating the sauce on my chick peas and rice. I added a bunch of hot sauce. Still delicious, just with a little more sweating than I originally signed up for.   Delicious.  I will be back again, probably for lunch after a morning of grocery shopping."}
{"text":"The food is some of the best fast casual Indian food in the area at a very reasonable cost. Definitely the Chipotle of Indian food. Place is always super clean and service is friendly and fast.  You have to check out the long table next to the service line."}
{"text":"Just checked out the new Choolaah's on Chagrin. Loved it.  Really liked the menu options, atmosphere was great and staff was so friendly and helpful. (It was obvious we were amateurs)  Highly recommend the salmon plate with naan and tikka masala!!!  YUMMY.   Best fast and casual experience !!!!  Yep,  beer and wine are also beverage options :)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff & Fast .. Delicious food.. I tried three different dishes .. Necessary to try this restaurant"}
{"text":"Fantastic...a gentlemen greeted me as I walked in and kindly helped me with the menu. Ordered the samosa chaat and chicken biryani. Had no idea what either were but it was all delicious. Beautiful restaurant too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Choolah is in the fast casual category--not fast food, but not a sit down restaurant either. Think Chipotle, Panera, Shake Shack. Choolah is definitely the Indian Chipotle. There are so many business opportunities with this concept.   Choolah is in a former car dealership--it's huge! It's high tech, modern, sleek. It makes Indian food cool and trendy. There is a glass wall separating the dining room and the kitchen, so you can see behind the scenes. There are plenty of seating options, including a community table and patio. They even have a \"hand jacuzzi\" to quickly wash your hands before you eat. The place is super neat and the space alone is worth a visit.  Now onto the food. My boyfriend and I both ordered the chicken tikka masala bowl, two pieces of naan, and a side of samosas. Our meal was a little over $20, which I think is reasonable. The samosas are a steal--3 for $2. They're small, but it's a good side to share. The chicken tikka masala was good, but not the best I've had. Our issue is that they put the masala sauce on the rice instead of on the side. I personally do not like a large amount of tikka masala sauce. It was also more spicy more others I have had. I would have enjoyed it more if the sauce was on the side, but now I know for next time."}
{"text":"We love it. I have a three and 6 year old who are not risky with their food, so we rarely get to go out for anything remotely exciting. Thank goodness for Choolah, now we can get some good Indian (for fast food) that is quick and reasonably priced. Best of all, the kids can get pizza or pb&js, so we can still go out as a family.   Staff is super friendly, the decor is interesting and a sophisticated."}
{"text":"Excellent place - quick trendy and awesome menu. The decor is cool - look at the tandoors or the 'choolahs'...I'd give them 5 stars if they add halal food to their menu!!!"}
{"text":"Greats fast 'gourmet' food. It is the Indian equivalent of chipotle. I've not yet been disappointed by anything on the menu. My favorite is the samosa chaat. I would, however, not recommend the chai, tastes artificial and watered down.  The interior is very trendy and cool. The automatic hand washer is a cool touch too."}
{"text":"Choolah is very large, very modern, very busy, and very hard to get out of! It's located right on a shitty spot on Chagrin, but crazy traffic and bad drivers won't stop me from going there. I love the paneer tikka masala- the paneer was deliciously creamy, and the restaurant manager informed me that it's made by the Amish in Amish country. Very cool. The chicken biriyani was good, but I enjoyed the tikka more. My only qualm is the price of the sides: $1.50 for a rather small section of naan is a little pricey. The samosas were good, nothing special.   While the food isn't authentic, it's suited for American palates and I still love the concept. Try it out.. and exit near the service exit for the dealer next door. Waaay easier than trying to turn left on Chagrin."}
{"text":"Delicious fast food style restaurant with bright modern  decoration"}
{"text":"Delicious I got the BBQ meal chicken tikka masala  with tandoori veggies and a bowl of black lentil soup yummy. Will definitely be back price is a little high 16.71"}
{"text":"really great food - i can't imagine better chicken. for chipotle-style ordering and atmosphere, it was good. a bit pricier than i expected, so i'll go back but not as often as if the prices were in line."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Cool atmosphere and great food.  Several people have referred to it as the \"Indian Chipotle\", which seems like a good comparison.  Its got a trendy, modern style with high quality freshly prepared food.  We got the Chicken BBQ plate with Naan and chickpeas, Chicken Tikka Masala bowl and a Lamb meatball sandwich.  Everything was great - fresh, clean and tasted great with a ton of flavor.  This is not Indian fast food that you get in a mall food court and it was much better than most Authentic Indian restaurants.  Hope this place does well."}
{"text":"Really delicious and great environment! Fast casual, helpful staff. I had the chicken BBQ meal with tikka masala and whole wheat naan. The spicy mango sauce was delicious!"}
{"text":"Being an Indian I would recommend this place to people of every ethnicity to try out this place. The taste and flavor of their dishes are really authentic and delicious. Thumbs up to the person who started this restaurant. Been there just once since I am not from around the place but I will definitely come here again. You cannot go wrong with the tikka bowls and BBQ chicken with rice and naan. Fantastic eatery!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of an Indian food \"chipolte\". Great concept and I love the hand washing station. The food was good if you want Indian food and are on the go."}
{"text":"The best Indian restaurant I have ever been in the US. Went there two times both the times the food was excellent. There tandoor chicken tasted authentic. Atmosphere and ambience is awesome. This restaurant belong to a different league of  Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Efficient workers, impeccably clean, and great food! The bathroom made me feel like I was at a nightclub! I think a great addition to the area"}
{"text":"Think Chipotle Indian style! This place is great for what it is - fast, convenient and delicious. I have been multiple times and the food is always fresh and hot! Don't be afraid to ask questions as the service is very helpful. My favorite is the chicken tikka masala bowl with naan on the side. I would also suggest experimenting with the sauces - they are on the side so you can try a few without ruining your entire plate if you do not like them. Be careful the hot sauce is powerful!"}
{"text":"We've eaten at Choolaah 3-4 times in the last few weeks and every time the food has exceeded our expectations! The salmon and chicken tikkas are fresh, succulent and grilled to perfection. We've tried almost everything on the menu and it's hard to pick a favorite...biryani, bbq plates and sandwiches are all mouth watering! Fiery hot sauce can be added for those who enjoy an extra kick. Kulfi, mango lassi and chai are definitely not to be missed. The  place has a cool vibe and the chic contemporary interiors are very representative of modern India. A restaurant like this was much needed in Cleveland. Choolaah will appeal to both novices and connoisseurs of Indian food. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"It's a fast-casual place... the ideal lunch spot; it's like Chipotle, but way better because 1. the food is amazing, 2. the service is always friendly/ patient/ helpful, 3. it's Indian = naan!  They have a handwashing station right next to the plastic-ware/ soda machine. A+ Excellent vibe. Very modern & clean.    The service is excellent... always friendly, smiling faces, willing to explain menu items or how the ordering process works. I got my order to go, and the person behind the counter made sure all of the order was accounted for.   Yes, the food is Americanized (we're in Ohio), but it's really good. I love that there's another vegetarian-friendly place in the area. I typically get a meal, which is a ton of food. Ask for extra hot sauce.   Unfortunately, I'm not in the area often so I only eat here once every month or so (please open more locations). They did a great job with location though, across from Whole Foods. There's an around-the-side exit if you can't/ don't want to turn left across the busy road."}
{"text":"Choolah has a great atmosphere with a lot of special touches. It's clear a lot of thought has gone into the decor and menu. We especially loved seeing the tandoor ovens out front and center. I had the veggie croquette meal with standard naan and yellow dal. Portions were more than generous (enough rice for a family), and the flavor was better than you could normally expect for a mass-audience Indian restaurant. The two hot sauces helped make up for the lack of heat. A fabulous place for a fast and satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Quick delicious low cost Indian fare similar in layout to Chipotle."}
{"text":"The food their is so delicious and the prices are great, when compared to alternative options, such as a steak house where everything is pricy. Choolah should become international."}
{"text":"Food is fine, naan is their big thing it appears. Some odd flavor combinations for my taste, but not bad.  The order/pickup area gets very crowded; that part of the layout is not the greatest, but the restaurant is very roomy, and quite popular."}
{"text":"I love Indian food. Happened to be in the area (I live 40 minutes away), had heard about Choolahh, and was thrilled to visit for lunch.  It's so open, inviting, modern and friendly. You feel good when you walk in. the menu and presentation made me think of Chipotle: relaxed, fresh, generous portions (mostly rice, it turns out), as you like it choices. And fast.  The ready-made mango lassi took me aback. It was OK, but not really enjoyable. We did not drink it.   The tikka masala flavor was very good. Mom devoured hers with salmon. My daughter liked her BBQ chicken and I, my tikka masala paneer. Only mom was able to finish her food.  I was disappointed in the vegetable sides we ordered. The lentil soup and chickpeas were mushy and bland. We didn't eat these either. This is not Indian food as I know it, which has subtly blended flavors to enhance the simplest of vegetables.  While mom and daughter would return, I'm not a fan. Spoiled, perhaps, by authentic fare at a fraction of the price in the East Village of Manhattan years ago."}
{"text":"Had the lamb tikka masala, it was great with the hot sauce they give you on the side!!  Nice heat, but not overpowering!!!  Anyone who likes Indian food, served quick, but with quality will love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Tikka Marsala. I enjoyed the blend of flavors and something a little different. It is similar to Chipotle only in ordering style. You pick your meat, rice and bread pretty much the way you do at Chipotle. The choices were nice and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I never have been particularly fond of Indian food.  That is due to my tradition American childhood of basically pizza and fast food.  I could never get use to the Aromatic spices that Indian food is so known for.  However, I noticed the great reviews and photos while on business in the Cleveland area and decided to give this nontradition approach to the cuisine a try.  WOW! I must say a hugh thank you to the owners and staff for reintroducing me to their version of Indian \"fast causal\" cuisine.  From the outstanding decor, the quick order process, easily understood menu, helpful staff, quick service and last but not least amazing food I personnely have a new found cuisine to enjoy and explore further.  The BBQ lamb meal was very tastey and the basmati rice cooked perfectly.  The freshly baked naan brought the meal together.  I will make this establishment a frequent stop, business or pleasure."}
{"text":"Choolah was absolutely delicious and the food came fast too. It's a nice place to get a quick bite to eat or even stay and have a drink for a little while. The staff were friendly and accommodating, making the experience even more positive. I highly recommend going here at any time."}
{"text":"We always try to visit local Indian restaurants in the hope that one will finally do us proud. When we drove by Choolah, our expectations went up, only to be quickly deflated once we visited shortly after it opened.   The best part was its decor - very trendy yet casual. The view of the tandoor ovens behind glass was a novelty that will surely grow old in no time flat.   Though some caution not to expect traditional Indian food from Choolah, you cannot even call it Indian fusion or hints of Indian. Any self-respecting Indian would not enjoy the bland curry, the watered down-chutneys and limited vegetarian options.   Even for my kids - who tried the pizza  - complained that it was American on a naan!  Plenty of other Indian restaurants in northeast Ohio that offer better food though not in a comparable atmosphere and most definitely with any quality in service (sadly, too commonplace at Indian dining experiences in America and in India).  Final verdict: Not worth a try unless you someone you know closely and trust implicitly is able to prove that food has dramatically improved since they first opened. Let someone else be the guinea pig; spend your dollars elsewhere in the meantime."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Best Indian food in the area. Store is clean and interior is really cool. Good service as well."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is great but just be careful u can become addicted and then become fat."}
{"text":"First time here. Sonya was helpful with suggestions. I ordered tikka masala chicken with naan. The food was fresh and delicious. I will come back."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Clean kitchen and simple menu. Sumptous taste."}
{"text":"Customer service was awesome. They walked me through the menu and wanted to make sure I had something I would enjoy. Being able to watch my food get cooked is always fun, and they have these very different oven/grill things. The decorations were very cool as well and I enjoyed the atmosphere. The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is because I did find the food to be a bit too hot (spice) for my taste. I am able to handle most full flavored food but I guess Indian is not my thing."}
{"text":"If you want an expensive soulless trendy and sterile pseudo-ethnic experience where they've turned 10000 tears of sub-Asian cuisine tradition into Panera Paneer and a tikka made out of Campbell's organic tomato soup (see picture) ... you'll like this place.  The naan is very thin and generally the food is mild.   The \"Amish paneer\" tastes a lot like \"Amish farmer cheese\" and has none of the sourness or creamy qualities.  One actual Indian American worker in the 20+ staff we saw.  This is the mall food court version of Indian cuisine.  They also messed up our order the first time I was here when someone else wanted something changed, I ended up with hybrid of what I ordered and what they did.  The manager gave me some free cheese as an apology and corrected it, too.  The naan so thin it's naan-existent and the biryani got merged with pot pie.  Enjoy upbeat house music encouraging you to eat  and leave quickly."}
{"text":"MAJOR rip-off and the food is not even good. I got the chicken Tika BBQ. I basically paid $9 for a bowl of rice with tasteless sauce and 5 tiny pieces of chicken. The bowl was not even half full. I would say there was about 1 cup of rice total.  The Naan bread was tasteless. It is not even real naan. If you go here expecting real Indian food you are going to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yes. It is like a chipotle for Indian food. Great flavors, fast service, and big open spaces for seating. The lamb, paneer and chicken were all flavorful and we would order all three again. They have a fancy soda machine that requires you to use a touch screen to get your drinks - kids loved it but it was a bit complicated for grandma. Ha!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here its amazing. Great atmosphere and great food. Do not miss the appetizers Samosa Chaat. Incredible. + they have the freestyle coke machines."}
{"text":"This is a quick dining service where you place your order and receive a buzzer similar to Panera when your food is ready. Our group ordered the chicken tikka masala, chicken biryani, the lettuce wrap with bbq chicken and extra naan. All the dishes were tasty, freshly made and promptly received, as in less than five minutes. For the quality of food, fair price, friendliness of staff, casual atmosphere/decor and speed that food was received, Choola's is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first Indian bbq experience. Open family style dining with plenty of cooking activity to keep you mildly entertained as you wait for your freshly prepared meal. From the Nan cooked in front of you to the delicious lamb meatballs with yogurt mint sauce the meal was almost too much to eat. But save room for desert the Kulfi Mango ice cream is a must!"}
{"text":"Good food, clean and spacious place. See through kitchen and cool hand warsher-massager.  However i feel the kids menu is limited for picky eaters because my children dont like spicy food like i do."}
{"text":"Not exactly what I was expecting but great food. I would describe it as modern Indian cuisine. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"So far everything I've tried is deliz...from a person that is vegan-ist, that's saying a lot."}
{"text":"I was skeptical. Another Chipotle-like modern fast casual eatery owned by a capital investment firm somewhere.  Slick and modern interior with ultra clean-crisp design elements.   But I loved it.    For about $8 I got a filling bowl of basmati rice, perfectly fluffy and steamed, topped with the most tender tandoori oven roasted chicken, alongside a wheat naan and a generous portion of tikka masala sauce and a sweet and spicy dip.    It's fast, simple, efficient and well done.  I inquired about more locations, and it looks like many more are in the works, but the locations are still TBD."}
{"text":"We loved the food!!!! We ordered quite a few things. The chicken tikka was excellent - compares to some of the best I have had in India. The chicken biryani was also very flavorful. The naan's were fresh and again among the best I have had in Cleveland for some time. Ambience was very excellent. Will definitely make this a regular place to eat out at."}
{"text":"I love it!!!! So yummy. I got the chicken with masala,rice and naan... Mango lassi is perfect"}
{"text":"Great chipotle model applied to Indian food. Good selection of meats and sides. Food is flavorful though less spicy than a more traditional ethnic restaurant. Service is prompt and cafeteria style. Decor is modern, comfortable and family friendly. Prices were similar to other higher end fast food places. Parking was ample and free."}
{"text":"Limited menu but great ambience, hygienic and very friendly staff. Chicken bbq is great, biryani so so. Wish they have more on menu, but i'l keep ordering chicken plate over n over. Love this place with feel of NY and space of midwest"}
{"text":"If you love chipotle you will love choolah. They had a few options but all of them looked delicious. There was very nice staff. Definitely going there again. There were even Indian people there. If you go there get the chicken barbecue meal."}
{"text":"Great food! Four stars for lack of customization and charging for every little thing like sauce and bread.."}
{"text":"I'm glad there's finally a fast Indian place near my home! Although I wouldn't say it's particularly authentic, the food here is very good and comes out quickly.   Imagine yummy Indian cuisine meets Chipotle: that's Choolaah.   And don't miss the hand washing station!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, authentic indian food taste in a fast food environment.  Clean and convenient."}
{"text":"Just ate here on a business trip. The place is beautiful, the food was fast, fresh, and delicious, and it was very reasonably priced. This is their first one, but I'm hoping they expand to Los Angeles!"}
{"text":"Great take out Indian food! It is fun to watch the food being made while waiting for your order. Service is good and people are nice."}
{"text":"First time-fantastic food, helpful staff that helped me make pairing choices and a great set up of the restaurant. All of this for a very decent price. Loved the whole experience!"}
{"text":"What a concept!  A chipotle style restaurant but with Indian food!  I will be back for sure.  Food was out quick and the beer was cold.   Had a lamb meatball bbq meal with naan and a kingfisher.   Food was very flavorful.   However if I could give a 4.5 I would only because the rice was just rice, nothing special.  Needless to say, if this is a franchise, I'd be interested in getting in!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! Speedy service, clean and modern restaurant, friendly staff! We are eating her for the second day in a row on our trip. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"To be honest, not the best I have every had.  Choolaah has very interesting design choices but the food lacks in the wow factor that is Indian food.   It's sub par at best.  Was really looking forward to real Indian BBQ but sadly it turns out to be another bi-product of lack luster Americanized ethnic food.  Portions are incredibly small, I could feed a small chihuahua (yes, I know they are small already) and it too would be hungry after eating there.  Prices are really high for what quality you get,  I get the idea of a Chipotle/ cafeteria style place but the place falls really short of that expectation.  Would I recommend to others...eh but say check it out and make your own decision."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have tried both vegan BBQ options and they are both excellent. The tofu and veggies is better, and the veggie masala side is a must. The samosas are a bit small, but still tasty, especially dipped in spicy mango sauce. Overall, quick service, great food, and large portions!"}
{"text":"Really loved the food every time I've been here! Service is quick and friendly. I took off a star because I think the food was a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"In Cleveland for a business trip and I found Choolaah on Yelp. I knew this was on my top 10 places to visit and it was right down the road from my hotel.   This place did not disappoint. I got the lamb meatball BBQ with masala sauce and it was a great mixture of flavors. I love how this was build from an old car lot show room.  I will definitely be back before I leave Cleveland.      Looking forward to when they open one UP in Fairfax, VA."}
{"text":"Had takeout from the restaurant the other night.  PROS: Excellent service and quite clean. We didn't order online but I bet it's convenient. Lots of sauces that I thought were quite good. The lamb balls were nicely cooked.  CONS: Very expensive for what it is. You are essentially paying about $15 for a meal. That's not horrible but the quality of food is on par with fast food. I enjoy fast food but not at that price. You can probably go to an Indian restaurant and get something better for the same price. The naan isn't really naan. The food presentation wasn't great. I thought the rice was quite soggy sitting in the sauce they pour on.  Overall, this is a fast casual restaurant that offers a convenient takeout experience with relatively high prices that serves Indian food that is probably geared towards those that are unfamiliar with Indian food."}
{"text":"Very high quality with great selections in an impressive atmosphere.  I've been trying to eat here since spring when I found it visiting whole foods across the street.will definitely come again."}
{"text":"They give you such small portions of the main course and they have the nerve to charge too much. Did you notice how small their dishes are? I think they use disposable plastic small dishes.   I would not recommend going there if you don't want diarrhea."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place. The food the people working there are amazing. The price is very responable as well. I would recommend this place to my friends and family ."}
{"text":"I am a fan and I've FALLEN IN LOVE with this place. This is an Indian take on chipotle and I must say I might not be going to chipotle anymore lol. I'm visiting from California and I wanted to try something Indian haha. I wish they would expand to California. This restaurant will never disappoint. Will make you come back for more. I am Indian and never had something so savory and so GOOD!"}
{"text":"I think it's an ideal place for those who likes Indian food but don't wanna spend time at dine-in. Choolaah Indian BBQ is a nice place to have decent Indian food with fast-food service. We had Choolaah rice bowl with chicken and added extra naan, and extra masala. I like there're many options for the masala sources, Tikka masala and Yellow Daal masala are really good! The size portion is pretty large for small appetites, but I think for guys will be perfect."}
{"text":"Worth a try. The food is good and the restaurant is very modern and clean. Good stop for lunch."}
{"text":"Better than it should be, I was pleasantly surprised- menu is a little goofy and hard to follow but the staff is cool and the food is reasonably good- fast and casual for sure- do it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love! So many different way to fix your meal. Bonus points for offering so many vegetarian options. The sauces are key. Customer service is excellent."}
{"text":"The hype is legit, guys. Ordering is easy, service is fast, and the food is excellent. I'm a big fan of traditional Indian food, and while this isn't quite that, these guys are killing it in a new fast and fresh category of Indian. The paneer was light, rich, and unlike any other I've ever had (in the absolute best way). The mango lemonade is delightful. The Naan was buttery and cooked perfectly. I left stuffed, and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is like an Indian Chipotle with endless options and combinations of BBQ meals. It's rare to find a place that is quick, vegan, and delicious - all for a very fair price! If you're unfamiliar with Indian food terms, the menu might seem a little daunting. I got the tofu and veggies BBQ with the yellow lentil masala and wheat naan. I ordered my boyfriend (who is not vegan and maybe has had Indian food once in his life) the veggie croquettes with chana masala and naan. He loved it and ate the whole meal! I would've finished mine, but you get a TON of food when you build a BBQ meal. The leftovers were still just as fantastic the following day. I can't wait to go back to try more menu options!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat. Really quick service and great food. Very vegetarian friendly place. The biggest downside is the menu is too small but that is also the advantage, you don't have to think so hard on what you want to eat. They don't have order over the fone or online ordering yet."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the atmosphere. It has a clean flow. The cashiers were very helpful during the decision making process. I asked to sample the masalas, and found a favorite. I went for the Choolah Perfect Balance bowl with Lamb meatballs. I like the options and ease of use with the menu, choose your protein, how you want it, any sides.  I like my authentic places a lot, but Choolah is a good, fresh take on the classics. So far, I've been there 3 times.  My only gripe is a personal one, it's a little expensive for me, so I can't go as much as I maybe would."}
{"text":"I was shopping across the street and saw this Choolah! My first impression- modern amenities with tandoor ovens and even a fancy soda machine. The food was piping hot, fresh and delicious. I'm glad I decided to give it a go! There are other fast food type Indian places popping up in the area-but this one stands apart with its bold authentic flavors and small details like fresh herbs. (Cilantro fans- go wild) They need to open one of these by the University circle area!"}
{"text":"Tried some takeout recently.  The aesthetics of the restaurant and website really impressed me.  I appreciate the spacious, uncluttered feel of the dining area, and I really like that the online menu has a photo of every item.  I would have given 4 stars if they had the prices and descriptions to go along with the photos.  I tried the veggie croquette meal (rice, wheat naan, tikka masala soup), and had mixed feelings.  The soup, naan, and sauces were all really good, but the main dish itself was pretty blah.  My meal came with several sauces, and I ended up dumping most of them on my rice.  I don't know which one was hot, but one of them was really, really hot.  My husband loved his chicken sandwich, but said he didn't think it was worth the price (I think about $6-7, but I'm not sure since the website doesn't give prices).  The samosas were decent, but not life changing."}
{"text":"A modern and fun place to get Indian flavors.   Having visited a few times, I have sampled few things on their menu, and they have all been a hit. Paneer, chicken, Biryani, naan, side of curries, Samosa..... All were pretty delicious.  Flavorful and yummy. Good quality fresh ingredients make a huge difference  The serving vehicles make it Visually appealing as well.  Only thing I did not like here is the chai.  Twice now I have found the chai on watery side.  The aroma is so good that I look forward to the sip.....but the taste and mouth feel falls short of expectations.  It does not help that it sits in a thermos. For me, it is not \"Indian\" chai!! The decor, the seating and the ambience in general are very inviting and make you want to stay longer. Some of the reviews mentioned the portion size....... I must say it is enough for me on a normal day. But I do feel that if I am really hungry, one portion may not be enough.   As such, we are so used to getting huge portions (and doggie bags for next day) that a reasonable amount of food seems inadequate. As for price......it is indeed on the pricier side for fast casual places.  It may be in line with other nice places in the area though. I will definitely go often."}
{"text":"I love the food there and the people who work there are friendly. The tikka masala bowl is awesome and filling"}
{"text":"Incredible. The food was really good, maybe the best lentil soup I've ever had. It was made fast and looked just as good as it tasted. We liked the the place right away when we walked in. Very clean and their core values are written right on the wall. After we left we looked the place up online to learn more about them. This is where we fell in LOVE with Choolaah. And they are doing just what they are setting out to do. I hope and pray others follow their example. Thank you Choolaah!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is YUM!!!! Chicken tikka masala, samosas, and a naan. No other words are needed!!"}
{"text":"Cool concept! Lines are still long but service is pretty efficient. We waited about 10 minutes. I love that the meat is locally sourced and the paneer is Amish made! Haha. I got a lamb wrap and my fiancé got a \"perfect balance\" bowl with chicken, plus some naan and mint ginger lemonade which were great. The flavors weren't anything out of this world but it was very good, simple, fresh, and with quality ingredients. Plenty of condiments to choose from to spice things up. The open kitchen concept lets you watch your whole meal being prepared as well!   The chicken bowl was a good portion size; my lamb wrap was delicious but definitely on the smaller side--although it's like an Indian Chipotle, don't expect Chipotle burrito sized portions. The lamb is halal and they labeled things that were vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free pretty well.   As a side, there was a mix-up and as we were finishing eating, we were brought a second lamb wrap by accident. I told them that i had already received and finished mine but they were super nice and told me to just take the extra wrap. Great service! We will be back :)"}
{"text":"SO good and SO fun.  Great atmosphere and fun to go with friends.  They have so many menu options and the price is reasonable you can try tons of options and not break the bank."}
{"text":"An absolute jewel in the midst of high-priced, so-so eateries.  It delivers great tasting, authentic East Indian food and the staff is consistently pleasant.  They have had the sense to limit their menu to a manageable number of items and all that we've tried have been delicious.  My favorite...the Rice Biryani with chicken."}
{"text":"Almost all the food was great -panneer sandwich, chicken Tikka sandwich,  vegetable croquet, channas, mint chutney were the best.  Great to watch them cook and good was served fast."}
{"text":"Took the kids this weekend and found the place very busy - there is definitely a market for this kind of mid-scale casual dining.  The place has a Chipotle type vibe and the restaurant is visually appealing and pleasant.  The food was really quite nice - some interesting flavor combinations and high quality.   The samosa chaat was the least compelling offering that night with cold and somewhat soggy filling.  The salmon and lamb meatballs were really good.  The big drawback for me is the value.    I'm willing to trade volume for quality but in this case I left the restaurant hungry after ordering a plate (protein, dal, naan).  Unfortunately, the side dishes are also very small for the price so there isn't an obvious way to economize a meal here.  I'm not a huge eater but I think this will be a major critique for many patrons - if I have to fill up my boys it will be Chipotle for us."}
{"text":"I just order a pick up from Choolah I had a chicken BBQ meal. Once I got back I noticed that my naan was burnt very badly to a point  I couldn't eat it. Then I didn't get a bowl but got a rectangular container with chicken and small side of rice ??? How does this happen I'm very dissapointed in the due diligence of the employees. Not sure if I will every order for pick up again or eat there again."}
{"text":"Very good Indian food. A totally different experience from any other Indian food restaurant. Choolaah is very clean, fast and bright. Definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"THE BEST. I have been waiting for this place to open. Finally did and I have been every Friday since opening weekend. I love love love it. As an Indian person and a student I super appreciate fast and delicious Indian food"}
{"text":"Choolah's is awesome! First of all, this place is NOT closed - not sure why Yelp is saying that it is. I got the Paneer cheese BBQ bowl with brown rice, regular naan, and tikka masala, which was very fresh and not very spicy at all! I loved the green mint yogurt as well. The place is clean and modern, and the service was quite fast. There's also a glass partition where you can watch them make the food. Definitely will go again for more!"}
{"text":"My lord this place has amazing food. The Samosa Chaat is so good! The tikka masala is so good. The naan is delicious. The decor is so nice and open. I especially love the long book table.   I love this place and can get a great meal for under 10.00. Definitely recommend it for first time Indian food goers."}
{"text":"Awesome Indian fast food.  Rather enjoyed the meal and the atmosphere is unique here.  Enjoyed watching the food being cooled in the ceramic ovens."}
{"text":"Overall, decent Indian food to satisfy your craving but I felt like it was missing a lot of the rich herb flavors and creaminess in your typical chicken tikka masala. The serving of the salmon was relative small...with that said I highly recommend getting the chicken. It was more on the $$$ side. Dinner for two was about $35 to $40 considering that it's fast food."}
{"text":"Indian food (fast casual concept) with family and friends.  Excellent food quality for the experience and style of restuarant.  You order at the counter and then wait for your buzzer to go off to retrieve your meal.  Large upright clay ovens lined up in a row behind the glassed-in kitchen gives you an open look into the cooking and prep process for your meal...great idea!  Watching the folks prepare the hooked meats to a perfect char and the process for oven-grilled Naan was fascinating.  Now on to the actual food!  The chicken tikka masala had great flavor and the chicken was very tender and juicy.  The tikka sauce was perfect for dipping the Naan, and served on the side so you could control how much to put on your main dish or simply use as a side.  The samosa order contained three small vegetable-stuffed samosa with a bright, fresh mint sauce.  Great meal in a unique atmosphere.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I'm not usually adventurous but I see all the cars every time I pass Choolah so I decided to give it a try.  So glad I did !  The food was terrific and the staff helped me decide what I might like for my first visit.   Thanks Choolah.  I'll surely be back !"}
{"text":"Finally we have a workable business model for a good indian fast food place! If you believe it or not, this is how delicious street food in India is (well a little spicy)!  Choolaah is trying real hard to make one of the most delicious cuisines in the world available to the most daring palates in the world! I went there with my family and we had fun figuring our their ordering system. Some of my family members didn't like the idea of toned down Indian flavors to suit the american palate, other enjoyed the novelty and taste. Overall everyone enjoyed something about this place.   I will not call it authentic indian food, but all famous ethnic dishes in USA are not authentic according to natives anyways. Its good food at a reasonable price in a very clean facility and still gives you the taste of India. You need to try it to decide for yourself but I will to there again if I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"It's Indian (sorta) and fast.   But the food quality can be spotty.  The meats are dry and tough. The biryanis are bland.  The naan lacks flavor.    Regardless, I do eat there and will go back because the food is different from anything else in the area. Also? Its a very pleasant environment, especially the patio on summer evenings."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying out the 'assembly-line' style in an Indian restaurant, and I've got to say....it's a hit! I will definitely be coming back here again. Fresh ingredients, friendly staff, and a very clean place."}
{"text":"The Bomb! Great food and value. My guess is you will see this concept spread across the country quickly. Like Chipotle, only Indian. Yum!"}
{"text":"Do not hesitate to eat here!  It's good.  You order kind of like at Chipotle- pick your meat, pick your rice, pick your bread, pick your sauce.  I had lamb meatballs, white rice, naan and tikka masala.  I also ordered samosas and a side of lava sauce.  Spent $16. They had free fire sauce in a dispenser next to chopped jalapeños, onions and lemon wedges. The naan was very good.  It was thinner than I like but it worked.  The tikka masala was thin also.  I like to have a thick piece of naan with a curry as thick as ketchup.  This curry was soupy.  Also, not as rich as I like.   I was suspicious that preparing it this way was more cost efficient and less time consuming, but I was rightly corrected that this recipe is actually a healthier way to prepare tikka massala.  Either way, it was good.  The lamb meatballs were nothing special.  I ordered the chicken on a second visit- delicious!  Samosas were good.  3 for $2.69.  Pav Bhaji was a meal size serving of vegetable curry and a grilled roll, $6.99.  Very good! All in all, the food was better than average and I'd eat there again, but one of the big reasons I give 4 stars, which I don't do often, is because I loved the hot sauces, chopped jalapeños and mint sauce.  The food was stand alone good, but being able to make it hot puts it over the edge for me.  I love spicy food and I don't mean black pepper- I want it HOT!   There's also a kid's menu, folks!  Take your kids there and expose them to a truly great culinary tradition- not to impugn the cabbage roll. Also, there's a hand washing station by the soda fountains in the dining area.  That's really cool!  You don't have to go the the restrooms and touch knobs and handles.  It's a \"hands free\" hand wash."}
{"text":"Bright atmosphere with open seating. Order up front and pick up when they buzz you.  They have a really cool hand washing machine. But if you have loose rings, be careful not to let them slip into the machine.  I got the Chicken BBQ with white basmati rice, naan, and Tikka Masala dipping sauce that you can also pour over your rice.  It was very tasty overall. The Naan was oiled and sprinkled with salt and cilantro or parsley. Chicken was good, nothing too special.  I also got the Mango Lassi as I usually do at all Indian restaurants. This one had pretty good mango flavor but was a little on the thick side and pre-made and sitting in the fridge so it's not freshly blended. It was good but can't say it was the best."}
{"text":"A very unique concept of Indian food.. Loved the Ambience and presentation  Only negative thing as per me is it's not real taste of Indian food..  A go to place when you are in a mood of fast food but Indian.."}
{"text":"The saying don't judge a book by its cover, really isn't applied here, it looks... deluxe! Not only that but people who don't understand what the indian food is made up of, they do a very good job with explaining it. The food itself is extraordinary, so if you feel like eating a flavorful, rich and all in all delicous meal go to choolah!!!"}
{"text":"My 1st time even heading of this place, but I love it, I got the chicken sandwich just to intoduce myself to the place, but I now realize, anytime I come to Cleveland I'll be eating here. I pray they open one in Nashville as well as other cities (I'll be researching this) great flavor, prices. I love the influx of culturally diverse casual dining places.  I normally don't eat Indian food, but this has intoduced me to even more offerings.  This is definitely a winner."}
{"text":"I love this place... fast quick and healthy.  I've been coming here since it opened.  I have always loved Indian food, so it's really nice that its super simple to grab a quick meal.   Exterior/Location: An old car dealership on Chagrin Blvd.   Interior:  Totally re-done, modern, well lit, and They have some real high tech gadgets... like the hand jacuzzi!    Vibe/Ambiance:  Moderm and technologically advanced.  Friendly, foody atmosphere.    Staff: Awesome and talented.  Welcoming  Clientele: Anybody.  Mostly younger, cultured adults.    Price:  I think very resonable!  I fed four people for $36.  That's even with extra soup and naan.  Must get items:  Buttered naan!  All items are tasty.  Why I love or hate it:  Love it!  Fresh, healtly and different than my usual food.   Final thoughts:  Try it.  I actually like it better than some of the more fancy Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"Fast casual style and seriously good Indian food. Highly recommend for lunch. Even during lunch rush it was not super packed. This would be a good place for a lunch meeting."}
{"text":"Came here for a soft opening and I was really impressed.  The interior looks nice and there's plenty of seating because they have an upstairs as well.  The service was excellent and my order came out in under 5 minutes.  Now onto the food, I got a lamb tikka masala power bowl, naan on the side, and mango lassi.  The mango lassi was very refreshing, the only thing I'd say is that it could be a bit colder.  The lamb came with white rice and vegetables, everything was seasoned perfectly.  The game changer was really the sauces that they have on the side.  I tried every single one and they all were delicious and complemented the lamb amazingly.  I will definitely be back to try other things when they officially open.  Lamb tikka masala: 9/10"}
{"text":"A great place for awesome, locally sourced, homemade Indian food. Choolaah features a variety of menu items that satisfy the vegan, vegetarian, or carnivore in your life and takes service to a whole new level. The staff are incredibly attentive and have separate areas for you to order and pick up your food. Have doubts about what's in your dish? Have no fear, you can watch them make it! The kitchen is surrounded by a glass wall and allows you perfect vision into the food they are preparing for you. They are also incredibly knowledgeable about all of the ingredients in each dish and can assist you in choosing which sauce pairs well with what.  The interior of the building is clean and modern, and has enormous windows for natural lighting. Lots of seating to choose from, including an upstairs balcony. They are also BYOB friendly, so have a go at pairing your favorite beverage with your favorite meal! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food is no where near to Indian authentic delicacies. After trying everything from biriyani, naan, paneer, and sandwiches: the sandwiches deserve a 5star, others are really bad. The desserts are worth trying. I have been there twice but sure of not visiting again."}
{"text":"If I could have my review consist of me smashing my keyboard over and over again followed by at least 200 exclamation points, I would, but where would the usefulness in that be? It might garner a funny vote from y'all, more than likely not a cool vote, and definitely not a useful one.  But, I digress. Work led me to the Cleveland area these past two days and I found myself near Eton around lunchtime. As I was driving around, I thought it sounded intriguing, but I figured I'd consult Yelp before making any major decisions.  And wouldn't you know, this place pops up first for lunch recommendations.   I got a Chipotle vibe when I walked in. Not just in their menu, but also the minimalist metal decor. In addition to their barbecue plates, they have salads and sandwiches with a tandoor twist. I settled for a chicken BBQ plate with wheat naan and tikka masala sauce because tikka masala is my favorite 5ever. They gave me a buzzer for when my order would be ready a la Panera or any other overrated chain restaurant, but it was ready in a a matter of minutes, and this was at the tail end of the lunch rush.  The chicken was super yummy as was the sauce, but I made the mistake of drenching my chick chicks and biryani with it-- they sure give you a lot! They also gave a little bit of what I think is some kind of mango sauce that I thought was too sweet to be part of the meal, but too spicy to be dessert (it kind of had the consistency of custard)  They have two choices of naan, regular and wheat. I opted for the wheat to be healthier (haha sure) and found it to be much crispier than naan that I'm used to. The next time I come back, I'll have to get the regular naan to see if it's lovely and fluffy like I know it.  Something really fun and gimmicky that they have is this hand jacuzzi that you can use to clean your hands after throwing out your stuff. I didn't make quite a mess, but I used it for the novelty of it. Now, that's something that should be in all American barbecue joints!  This place made me more excited to be moving to Ohio. Even though I'll be living in Columbus, I may very well make the 2-hour drive just for this place. With some luck, they'll take their concept to Cbus, too!"}
{"text":"Far exceeded my expectations...wow, good stuff.  I want to call this place the Chipotle of Indian food but that description completely dumbs it down.  The flavors are authentic Indian...it is so approachable for people who are new to Indian food and flavors (but not for this old goat...I have eaten seriously authentic Indian over the years).  There is a great sense of humor about this place from the naming of the chulah ovens to the copy on the napkins.  I ordered the chicken tikka, chickpea masala, Naan and a side of hot sauce with the side of mango sauce.  Deeee-licious.  And flavorful without being spicy.  If you think Indian food has to be blow-your-ears-off-spicy, eat here and debunk your own myth (or go eat at Taste of Kerala and actually have your ears blown off).  Are you as neurotic as me about what you eat?  Check the back of the menu for a complete list of nutrition information.  BOOM.  Not sure why BBQ is in the name...does not make sense to me.  Anyway...Brilliant concept, great atmosphere.  Save that last piece of Naan for me...pretty please?"}
{"text":"Right from the start we were greeted warmly. The gentleman who waited on us gave us a tour of the menu and even gave us a sampling of their different masala sauces. We also got an appetizer the samosas. They were wonderful and although fried weren't greasy. We each had lamb meatballs as our protein and my version came with the tandoori veggies. Definitely will be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"This was a really unique place to visit. I loved the food and so did my date. The handwashing machine and the sentence wall is an added bonus!"}
{"text":"Such an unconventional and creative way of dining out for Indian. When my partner suggested we go for indian food while we were in a rush to get to our appointment, I was skeptical that we'd have enough time. Then we walked into this establishment, which is basically a fast food-indian restaurant, I was convinced that we could sit down, eat and leave soon! Unlike other fast food restaurants, however, Choolaah did not spare quality in exchange for speed. I was impressed with the endless combination of foods/proteins I could pick out. The taste was exceptional- as good as other 'authentic' indidan restaurants in Pittsburgh. Although it is a fastfood establishment, the food cost does come out to be similar to a sit in restaurant. I paid about $40 bucks for my parter and me- I did leave with leftovers. I was impressed and I would come here again."}
{"text":"I love this place! Literally everything is 5 stars: service, ambiance, food! I usually get the chicken bbq bowl with tikka masala and naan. It's the perfect amount of food to make you feel completely satisfied bordering on too full. The perfectly spiced chicken is so tender it's falling-apart. If I'm feeling extra indulgent I get a chocolate truffle, they are seriously amazing. Better than those I've had in actual chocolate shops. I eat here way more than I should admit, it's on my way home from work and goes great with a stop for groceries at Trader Joe's down the road!"}
{"text":"First off, I have to say that the owners poured a ton of cash into this place. It's modern, sleek, and focused on local and pure ingredients. People have said it's like an Indian version of chipotle, but I think that description is way off. First off, the ingredients are better and most of it is made from scratch in the restaurant. There are some customizations of various BBQ plates, but you place an order versus standing in a cramped line. The choices for sides are fairly simple, which is a good thing.   As for the technology - they have a coke freestyle machine, and this was my first encounter with this amazing contraption. It could be a whole star by itself. Lemon coke zero? Yes, please! The automatic hand washer is pretty cool and super practical.   I have to admit that I had high expectations for this place, but keeping in mind it's a fast-casual restaurant, the standards are different for sure. From my experience, the samosa chaat was the best - soft and crispy with a good blend of spices. I was very disappointed with the vegetable biryani. They bake a naan crust over it, but this just turned out hard and basically in-edible (although this was take out). The actual biryani was not good. They serve basmati rice, which is a plus - but both times I've had it, it was too dry. The lamb meatballs were tender and tasty with the mint yogurt - much better than what you'd expect from a fast casual place. The chana masala is a yummy side choice and the chai was better than average.   Overall it runs about $11-12 for a meal and a drink. It's steep for Cleveland lunch, but the overall quality is high and the portions are large - so it's definitely worth it. Another big plus, the menu offerings are much healthier and nutrition information is readily available on hand held cards. Great for people who like to know what they're eating. I will definitely be back to try their other menu offerings."}
{"text":"Fast food Indian - what?!?!?  Amaze-balls.  That's this place.  The tikka masala with paneer and brown rice, with a side of veggie balls is my typical order.  The paneer is either rubbed or marinated in the perfect blend of spices.  The tikka sauce is mild, and well flavored.  Oh, wait!  The naan!!!!  Salty, herby, soft, perfection!  Such a wonderful place.  Make the trip.  You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I can't comment on the actual restaurant but my friend brought me food from there yesterday and it was just as rave-worthy as my husband had made it out to be!  The samosas were perfect, the chicken tikka masala was so flavorful, the basmati rice was fantastic, and the naan was perfect.  But the kulfi... mmmmmmmm give me more!  I can't wait to actually visit there - I've heard it's sweet.  BTW my friend that brought me the food is Indian and he loves it so that has to count for something!"}
{"text":"Very welcoming, modern decor.  Open kitchen, watch them cooking your food.  Service was quick.  Very spicey but good.  Limited selection on main dishes, although a lot of sides."}
{"text":"Having seen the long lines outside this place the past few weekends since this place opened, I was dying to try to see if it was worth the hype. IT DEFINITELY WAS. I guess they market themselves as a \"Chipotle for Indian Food\", which would be accurate. You get to pick a protein, then add it to a signature bowl or create your own... and there are sooo many choices! I got the chicken tikka Choolaah bowl with greens and brown rice, my friends got the lamb Choolaah bowl and paneer Choolaah bowl with naan and black lentil daal. The food is fresh, flavorful and served hot... with a variety of chutneys to add to your liking. I personally doused my paneer and lamb with the mint chutney, which tasted as good as homemade. The ambience and decor of this place are incredible, very modern and unique with accents of Indian pop art. The coolest thing is that you can see  the naan being cooked in the tandoors right in front of you. The food hit the spot, and the service was also very good. I highly, highly recommend this place if you're looking for a quick Indian food fix that's not the nasty, generic stuff they serve at most Indian restaurants (especially buffets) in the U.S.. huge props to the owners for this cool concept fast casual restaurant! OH! Also, the mango lassi was deeeeelish!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype! This place lived up to the hype and beyond.   First of all, they have made such great use of the space. You come inside and it is bright, clean, and open. The kitchen is totally visible from the dining area, including the massive ovens cooking up all kinds of deliciousness. Free parking for 45 mins in the garage next door is a huge bonus.  The ordering process is generally smooth, but the menu can be confusing at first, so you'll probably need to take a few minutes in line to figure out what you want and how to order it. Dont be deterred by the lines. I'm sure the lines will move faster as people figure out how to order.  Now, about the food (obviously the most important part). I got a chicken masala bowl with basmati rice and chick pea masala and a side of Naan. I dare say it may have been the best meal I've ever had for 10 bucks. The chicken was so incredibly juicy (it's Bell and Evans!!!) and covered in a heavenly blend of spices. The chickpea masala had the perfect amount of kick to it. When mixed with the rice the entire bowl became a hearty and unbelievably satisfying meal. I scooped up every bite with the rest of the naan. I will be back again very soon. This place is amazing."}
{"text":"We decided to try Choolah after its grand opening because of all the hype about it in the Indian community. The place does live up to the hype. The decor is artsy and contemporary. The place is kind of crowded I think since I went there at noon once and also at like 4 pm once which isn't lunch or supper. Maybe it has to do with it being so new. The queue for ordering could move faster but I think this isn't restaurant's fault but merely because of the unique concept of presenting Indian food as most people think of \"curry\" when ordering Indian food and Choolah has so much more to offer. I have tried salmon tikka with salad bowl and chicken tikka with perfect combo bowl while my vegetarian wife has tried samosas, pav bhaji, and veggie bowl. The samosas kind of suck and are far from being authentic but everything else was spot on. We ate in and the ambience is casual. They have these bench and seats right in front of stalls for condiments and drinks which makes the place really stuffed up and hard to move around and I'd suggest they take that off. The open kitchen with naans being made right in front of you is amazing and definitely worth watching if you haven't ever. All my friends who have been to this place have loved it and we all will surely come here again and again!"}
{"text":"A welcome addition to the East End!  Love this concept of an Indian Chipotle.  The menu may seem overwhelming when you first arrive but the staff is so friendly and helpful so be sure to ask. Order at the counter and your food is served quickly at the next counter over. They have plenty of seating including an upstairs.   I highly recommend starting off with the mango lemonade-it is so tasty.  You have bowls, wraps and numerous sides to choose from for your entrée. The food is filing and more than enough. I always stick with the bowl with either white or brown rice topped with the black lentil daal and for my protein the paneer.  You also have lamb, chicken and numerous other meats to choose from. I have been to India a few times and the paneer at Choolaah is as authentic as you can get. Don't forget to upgrade to include a side of naan bread topped with butter and garlic. It is to die for!  If you still have room for dessert they have ice cream and I recommend the mango."}
{"text":"Great organic Indian food and phenomenal mango lassi's. Great friendly decor and truly fast food. I'll certainly return to Choolah for more fantastic Indian food."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Indian food in a fast food concept. Paneer was very tasty and fresh. Their mint sauce was yummy. Spicy Mango sauce was very different. Try this place if you like Indian food"}
{"text":"This place takes a very interesting and successful approach to fast casual (think chipotle or panera). You enter and order from a cashier, and your options include BBQ plates, bowls (like a burrito bowl), sandwiches/ wraps, and salads. There are also desserts on the menu (I think mango lassi), but I didn't get the chance to try those.   After you order, you get a little beeper thing, and you go find a seat until it buzzes, and you get your food. For me it only took about 5 min.   At the recommendation of the person taking our order, each person I was with ordered the BBQ plate, which comes on a big bed of rice, has a side of naan, large sauce, and small sauce on the side. I had the paneer, which was definitely better than paneer I get at the Indian buffets around here. I got a tika masala sauce and a mint chutney, which all blended really well. The naan here was amazing, it had some spices on top which added great flavor. Overall, the meal was good, but overloaded on carbs (HUGE bed of rice, big slice of naan) and had no veggie option. That's why I give 4 stars instead of 5. I left feeling overstuffed, but that was probably my fault. Next time, I would certainly get a bowl or salad, something lighter and with more veggies. I wouldn't recommend the bowl as a balanced meal."}
{"text":"Feels like a Chipotle, love the fact that the kitchen is completely encased in glass.  Apparently this is not a chain; at least not yet.  Everything is fresh.  Very tasty."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It is basically the chipotle of indian food. Everything is really clean, really organized, and there's a diverse cast of employees. It's not a traditional family owned sit-down place... much more like a chipotle than a \"restaurant\" and I didn't really like their lamb meatballs so I can't really give it 5 stars but the chicken BBQ was terrific, the paneer wrap was also really good, and their mango lemonade it phenomenal. 4 stars seems right."}
{"text":"Ohh yes ! Fell in love with the place the first time I got a takeout. Decided to eat in this time around and boy it was even better than the last time around . The concept - a fast food Indian ? How's that even possible - but here it is - and the concept works - it's quick- the order taking ( you order at the counter) and the preparation and yet it is delicious as if everything was cooked right then and there- and tastes fresh too ! I don't think any other Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh can even match up to the flavors here at Choolah!  Am I overdoing the review ? Hell no ! The place deserves all the praises . The biryani is a must ! Though not authentic - but yet soooo nice - it's easy on the spices but high on flavor. The samosa chaat was good as an appetizer. The chicken wrap was to die for - chicken tikka pieces and the juices of the chicken just makes it perfect. A little messy to eat though ..but then it's by Indian food if it's not messy :)  The Choolah bowl with paneer was also amazing . But here comes the highlight of the day for us - the chai - an Indian would give anything for the perfect chai ! And the malai kulfi . You just need to have it !  So I'm all lovey dovey for Choolah ...it's far for me but I'm going to make sure that I get here atleast once a month !"}
{"text":"I had my second Choolaah experience this weekend and though there were some frustrating moments, I will still be going back.   First off the frustrations: We went Sunday afternoon for a late lunch (1:30ish). The line was long and there were a limited numbers of cashiers. We waited in line a good 15 minutes to order. We both agreed that we would use order ahead on our next visit.   Now here is where my frustration is mixed. Part of the reason the line was moving so slow is that cashiers were guiding customers through the menu in such excruciating depth that orders were taking multiple minutes to put in. One cashier actually brought samples of each masala to a group of four so they could taste before ordering. While I appreciate the commitment to customer service and satisfaction, this was frustrating to watch. I would rather see samples be given in a separate location so customers can make informed decisions before standing in line.   Now for the actual food: On my first visit I got the Perfect Balance bowl with Tikka and Lamb. It was exceptional. The lamb was perfectly cooked and the sauce was the perfect pairing. On my most recent visit I ordered the Choolaah salad with Salmon. I wouldn't normally order salmon at a fast casual restaurant, but the strength of my first visit encouraged something out of the ordinary. It was quite good, though not as a good as the Perfect Balance. (Note that this is probably due to the fact that I rarely, if ever, feel fully satisfied after a fish meal.)  Overall Choolaah is great. Its ordering system is a little slow (definitely consider ordering ahead!), but that can be worked out."}
{"text":"This place  reminds me of the Indian version of chipotle but more expensive. I like the chicken tikki masala you can also get it with a lamb meat ball which does not taste too great or you can get it with salmon for $3 extra which I think is too expensive for what you get.  Watch out for the big long wooden table near the entrance, there are books glued to the bottom which is Hard not to bang your knees on and there are too many stools at the table and makes it hard to maneuver your legs .  I also banged my knees on the booth seats. The outdoor chairs are also not comfortable to sit in. WHO DESIGNED THIS PLACE?! They should be fired"}
{"text":"Love it! Think chipotle for Indian food. Fast, fresh, and clean. Menu is very simple with only a few options but well executed. Food isn't spicy so even people with a low spice tolerance would enjoy it. Not a fan of their vinegary hot sauce they offer on the side."}
{"text":"The food is perfect! The front desk young lady was super nice and offered us five different samples of masala. This is the best Indian food in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"It's the best Indian restaurant in town. I'm really shocked (In a good way) to see a place like this in Cleveland. Great food. Great customer service."}
{"text":"I have been going here since it opened and it has consistently been amazing. I have never had a bad experience. The wait time is never too long and the food is always fresh. I like my food spicy and I love their hot sauce. My order varies from the BBQ chicken to the lamb meatballs. I also like their tikka masala if I want to switch things up. You receive a lot of food for your money. Great service too, everyone is always smiling and happy."}
{"text":"There was some buzz around this restaurant and I finally ate here. It was perfect because on the day that I went, they were offering some samples of the different sauces available. While I had looked up online what I wanted before going, the samples confirmed my choice. I was very pleased with the Chicken Choolah Bowl with Black Lentil Masala. So delicious and flavorful. One day I'll have to try to Paneer which looks so good too! I waited quite a well, but that's fine knowing that my food is made fresh. The condiment station is plentiful with more options to embellish your food. The person who gave me my food made recommendations based off what I ordered. I definitely recommend Choolah especially if you're looking to explore!"}
{"text":"Decor - A unique spot in Beechmont that resembles a mix of indian cuisine and Chipotle style of delivery. This Indian \"fast food\" joint puts other eateries to shame with their modern design and clean concept. Their prep and kitchen areas are encased in glass, which includes multiple tandoor ovens. I literally saw my naan from dough to oven to serving plate.  Service - The service staff are knowledgeable and friendly. The manager/server actually made their way to each table and remembered what everyone had ordered. They seem to care about the experience.  Food - All the food for our party was hot and the naan was freshly made. I really appreciated their attention to vegan and vegetarian options. The heat and spices in their sauces and curries are good to introduce people to indian food. However, my party felt that the heat could be increased and the salt should be decreased. Other than that, everyone enjoyed their dishes.  Overall - fresh and fast indian at a reasonable price. I'll be coming back her often."}
{"text":"Please note that my meal, like those of other reviewers at pre-opening special events, was complimentary. My meal would have been $12.24.  This is an Indian fast casual restaurant, offering mostly bowls of rice, veggies, and proteins, along with other Indian-American staples like samosas. They are tech and feature-forward offering online ordering and pickup, Coca-Cola Freestyle machines, and even an automated hand washing unit for customers. The ambiance is clean, modern, and upscale for the market. Dishes are about $9-$13. You can BYOB into the restaurant and they are right next door to a wine store.   I ordered a Choolaah Meal, their basic rice bowl, selecting white rice over brown, and Paneer cheese as my protein with tikka masala as my sauce. It came with a piece of naan bread. For a drink I ordered a mango lemonade.  Everything was good. Rice was cooked to a perfect consistency and seasoned nicely with the right balance of salt and hint of butteryness. The organic Amish cheese had a nice satifying texture to cut and bite into and was firm without being rubbery. The cheese was just powerful enough to not be overwhelmed by the sauce, which was good but unremarkable.  The highlight for me was the naan bread, which was just perfection. Salted and seasoned just right, cooked perfectly. It tore beautifully and was just some of the best Indian bread I've ever had. Definitely not to be missed.  Speaking of sauces, a bar of pumps has several additional ones on offer. I tried the Tamarind apple sauce and the Choolaah Fire sauce. The apple sauce went quite well with the Paneer cheese, giving it a bit of sweetness. The Fire sauce is the lesser of the two hot sauces, and I don't think I'll be trying the Lava! Fire was more than hot enough for my tastes, a little bit goes a long way.  Service was outstanding and very fast, the kitchen was working like clockwork. Despite a huge line nearly out the door my wait to order was under 15 minutes and I had my tray of food less than 3 minutes after that.  Even with the crowd, seating wasn't an issue for me dining alone.  The attached parking garage has 45 minutes of free parking, and despite the thick crowd and huge rush of people clamoring for free meals, I almost made it. I ended up paying $3 in parking, which of course was a fantastic value.  I intend to return to Choolaah as a paying customer, and I look forward to trying the local Bell & Evans humane farm chicken, their in-house ranch sauce, and one of the Tandoori wraps."}
{"text":"Good food at a fair price. Told the nice guy it was my first time there and he  perked up and helped me eagerly with my order. He even let me taste the soup (?) which was DELICIOUS!! And don't get me started on the truffle! Was a little slice of heaven in a little soft chocolate ball. So glad I got two!...99¢ each. Oh and I got the cheese Paneer plate (kinda tofu-ish.) with rice, bread and a lemonie green sauce for dipping and lemon wedge garnish. Only had to wait 5 minutes or less for my order. Will definitely go back! Great little meal all for $10.97!"}
{"text":"Color me surprised to find decent Indian food in Ohio, especially when it's described as \"fast food.\" I got a paneer tikka masala, my mom got a chicken plate. I really enjoyed the sauces on the side, especially the mint yogurt; I tried the Choolah Fire sauce and was disappointed at how mild it was. Alas. I do like me some spice.   Everything I ate was tasty and well-sized; I left feeling full but not bloated, despite having eaten every last bite. I almost opted to get a mango lassi, but once I saw that customize-your-own soda machine, I knew I had to just get that. I'm a sucker for pressing buttons.    I wish I had one of these places near me so I could hit them up for weekday lunches; it's the perfect quick meal that is super satisfying and doesn't drain your wallet."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and never been disappointed with the food, their veggie biriyani wasn't one of their best, but we had several other varieties it was all really good, especially paneer, it's soft and tasty...best part of the meal Was mango lassi! Choolah meal was perfect for my 2 year old toddler and 82 year old grandma"}
{"text":"So good! The amount of chicken that came in my Choolaah bowl really surprised me. The naan was fantastic too. All very fresh ingredients with authentic taste. I will definitely be back. Outdoor seating is a bonus!"}
{"text":"On Wednesday nights after work, my husband and I trek to the east side for evenings with friends. One night we decided to check out a place we had seen while driving around the Beachwood area-Choolaah. Let me tell you, this was the beginning of what has become a weekly love affair with this place! When you first pull up and get out of the car, you can already smell the delicious food that's being cooked inside. The place is fast casual, and you build your meal from various components in their menu. They have a wide variety of ingredients and dishes that suit nearly all diets. They have four tandoors, large ovens with holes in the top through which you place skewers of delicious food to cook. It's fun watching them prepare and place the skewers into the tandoors and watch the cooking process go down. Even though the place is fast casual, the food is actually very authentic! I spent a lot of my college years eating at friends' houses whose parents were from India, Pakistan, or Bangladesh; and the food at Choolaah brings to mind the food my friends' moms would serve us. It always brings a smile to my face!Also-you MUST try the naan, it is absolutely fantastic here!  I like to order the bbq bowl with white rice, naan, chicken OR paneer (a type of cheese that looks like tofu), and the chickpea masala. My husband likes to order the same, except with yellow daal (a lentil dish) rather than the chickpeas.  Going to Choolaah on Wednesday's has become our weekly ritual, and we always look forward to it! The place is also very clean, and the staff has always been extremely friendly and on top of their game, even on super busy nights."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service!  I came here for the first time, and our cashier very patiently went through the menu with me to explain how everything works. She even brought out a tray of masala and drink samples, so I could try everything before making my final choice.  I ordered a choolaah bowl with lamb meatballs and yellow lentil masala. It was very delicious!  I also had a side of samosas.  There is a wide variety of sauces to choose from too.  All in all, it is fast food, but a unique take on it, well done.  I will come back for more!"}
{"text":"So impressed! Place was pretty busy on my first visit yet we waited only a minute in line, and got our food within 3-4 min of ordering (at the most!). The woman who took our order was bright and enthusiastic, and really good at explaining some of the offerings i hadn't heard of.   I went with chicken tikka masala, and my friend with a panner sandwich and we were both very pleased! The chicken in my dish was bountiful, beautifully seasoned,  just perfectly slightly charred, and full of flavor. The Masala sauce and rice were absolutely delicious as well. We have a lot of fantastic Indian restaurants in Cleveland, and I'm happy to say that Choo Laah compares very well! Especially considering the fast service.   Will absolutely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"I would recommend this place, but the food does is not authentic (indian food).  Pros: ambient, good options, food is ok Cons: you will be disappointed if you expect authentic food What to look for: Kulfi, BBQ options (veg and non-veg) are good  We visited Choolaah twice. I had biryani, BBQ vegetarian and lamb, kulfi. Biryani is not authentic, I will avoid it here. BBQ is good and Kulfi is excellent."}
{"text":"Not the Restaurant I will go again with family . Too Loud and not comfortable seating arrangement. Décor is good ..but my house décor is much better . Portions were too small for the price. The samosas had a different shape and the potatoes had not flavor at all, though the mint sauce was really good . The cheese was very different and not even close to the one we get at Indian Restaurants. It became dry after 15 Minutes . The lamb had too much of fat and looked like frozen lamb and wasn't cooked well . The Naan bread was too thin and crispy with no taste of butter . Didn't see any Indian staff in Kitchen and that explained why the Indian taste was missing in curries. The lemonade was good and different and don't see at many Indian Restaurants ."}
{"text":"I came for dinner to support a local nonprofit. I liked the modern floor plan and color of this fast casual restaurant. The staff was super friendly as this was my first visit. Ordering was easy and our orders arrived quickly. I ordered the choolaah salad with lamb. I loved the seasoning on the lamb and the side dressing. I plan to visit again soon with friends."}
{"text":"My coworker and I stopped for lunch and loved it! We both got perfect balance bowls with chicken and tikka masala- it was delicious! MINT GINGER LEMONADE IS TO DIE FOR! Please consider selling it by the gallon I would literally buy it daily!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place looked awesome inside. I had the bbq chicken bowl with the tiki masala and really enjoyed it, a little kick of spice! My boyfriend had the lamb I thought it was more bland when I had a tast but he likes it. Make sure you get a side of naan!  Also- side note the hand washing thing they have next to the drink machine is pretty neat- all the kids eating were entertained and actually wanted to wash their hands."}
{"text":"Kudos to the owner of the this restaurant! It truly revolutionizes the Indian food cuisine experience. I can see it as a large chain in the near future.   Food is delicious. Service is great. The place is very clean and the kitchen operation is behind glass - so you can see everything, which is pretty cool!   So glad that I live 5 minutes from this place! Would definitely recommend it to anyone! Believe me, you will not be disappointed at all!"}
{"text":"Excellent! We love Indian food. Great atmosphere food is made with fresh ingredients and it was very clean. I would have taken a picture but I ate it too fast!"}
{"text":"Great fast food place. Great service and decent Indian food, flavors and quality for fast service. Chipotle-style with different option combinations and price. They don't make the food right in front of you, but you can see their ovens and food stations behind enclosed glass. Very clean, slick and open inside.  If you're looking for authentic food, you may want to find a sit-down place (e.g., Jaipur Junction far away in Hudson is my favorite). However, this establishment pulls off this newer fast food concept very well, with friendly service.  Quality of meat (e.g., lamb) could improve but the naan was tasty. The food is a tad oily for me, but I overall really like this place.  ----  The chicken tikka masala definitely improved in taste since being here last, months ago.  Grilled chicken and I enjoyed the fact I could combine the mango sauce and tikka masala sauce myself.  I also really enjoyed my mango lassi."}
{"text":"We went the weekend they opened and have been back several times since. The staff is friendly, the food is yummy, and it's kid friendly. I love the concept and and am glad to have this so close to home."}
{"text":"Pros: Awesome ambience. Best in the fast food business.  Cons: Wish taste of the food was Indian. I had chicken biryani bowl and mango lassi. It was the worst biryani I have ever had. It wasn't spicy and chicken pieces lacked flavor. Mango lassi wasn't great either and lacked sweetness.  Advice: If you like real Indian food, avoid this place. And on second thought...if you like good food, avoid this place."}
{"text":"LOVED IT!!! The service was awesome, the food came soo fast, the decor was beautiful, and the food was delicious! The paneer was perfectly grilled, and their Mint Ginger Lemonade was to die for! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"this place is amazing, absolute treasure. Diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Great Indian fast food. Chipotle style ordering, but lots more options/sides. I had the tofu veggie bowl. Tofu was good (big thick multi-bite chunks), but the veggies were even better in terms of grilled flavor/taste, so I probably would have been just as happy with all veggies. Also had a veggie croquette I was tempted by. I added fresh red onion, jalapeño, and lemon juice from condiment bar along with their spicy sauce to round it out (bowl came with spicy mango sauce, too).   Yellow lentil dhal was my masala and to die for. Much more flavorful than I expected! I could probably eat a dhal rice bowl for lunch from here daily :D This place really does justice to Indian flavors.   Naan was thin and crispy and sprinkled with black onion seeds and cilantro. I thought this was great...my 7 year old didn't. Would ask for his plain next time. He loved his mango lassi though! Husband had a lamb BBQ bowl, which came with mint yogurt sauce. His only complaint was he wished he had ordered some veggies, too. We both appreciated the Coke freestyle fountain options.   Atmosphere was great. Big open bright space. You can watch them grill. Variety of seating options: indoor/outdoor, tables/booths, long communal table with embedded hanging books down the center. Cool art and decor all around. Lots of fun details to discover. They really did a nice job designing this space!"}
{"text":"Everything was so perfect that there's not much more to say than that. But....the customer service was fantastic, the food was absolutely delicious, and the special whirlpool hand wash machine was a fun touch to this modern Indian restaurant! Definitely going back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"This place is super convenient and great if you're in the mood for something different. They have lots of lighter fare and healthier options along with a extensive section for people with dietary restrictions or vegans/vegetarian. It can be a bit overwhelming to order if you're not familiar with Indian food but the staff is very helpful and willing to answer any questions you may have. They also have a number of options that appeal to younger kids or those with less adventurous taste buds.  Of your not into spicy foods, like me, fear not they have plenty of milder options. Great place if your looking for a quick lunch or dinner on the go, easy to take in or carry out. You should definitely try at least once!"}
{"text":"We eat lots of indian food and decided to eat at choolah. Food was tasty but the portions are ridiculously small. We don't eat that much to get full either. Within a few minutes we are all were hungry again!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit - with our neighbors who want to try it out. The tried several different things and were so disappointed. Did not finish even 1/2 of the biryani that they were most excited about. The rice was undercooked. The Chana masala that I had liked last time was sour. The legume soup was tasteless. The only saving grace was the samosa chat, mango lassi and kulfi.  Seems like it is getting worse."}
{"text":"Yes! I was in town and decided to check out this place. The decor was really nice and modern with a touch industrial. The space was really clean and airy.  We ordered the lamb plate, chicken plate, samosa chadd, truffles and mango lassis. Mango lassis waere amazeballs.... Creamy, a touch of sourness from the yogurt and mango-i. Totally recommended, get it and you won't be disappointed.  Food was also very good, albeit not as spiced as the usual indian food, and yes, my friend's samosa chadd was better (coz she's awesome) but theirs were decent . Lastly the chocolate truffles gives enough sweetness to roundup the meal.   Prices were totally reasonable for the amount of items we get. When the food arrived, we thought that it was not that much... But oh were we wrong.... The portions filled us up for sure.   Overall, we had a pretty awesome experience. Cool atmosphere, clean space, great customer service and awesome food. We will be back to Choolah!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken tikka masala and regular naan.  Tasted amazing.  They have the cool computerized soda machines.  The man who took my order gave me a really quick and detailed run-down of the menu and he was nice.  The service was really fast. I thought it was going to take longer because they gave us the little buzzer things, but it took like five minutes.  There were a lot of Indian patrons, which is always a good sign when you go to an ethnic restaurant."}
{"text":"This was my second time at Choolaah. I had a similar experience to my first time...no disappointment!  I ordered the choolah bowl with paneer and a choolah salad with veggies to split with my husband. Both were really good. The paneer pieces were very thick. I loved them. We ordered our food to go. Everything was packed very well and it was intact when we got home. We parked in the garage behind choolaah. It is free for the first 45 minutes. Beats trying to find a spot on the street.  Im not in the mood for indian food everyday but when I am I will be sure to return."}
{"text":"Great food, service and ambience. Should include more food options/varieties like rajma, kadhi, kaali daal, aaloo gobhi, bhindi.. Overall, must go restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken wrap with the tamarind apple and the spicy mango sauces. Was so so good. One wrap didn't fill me up so had to go back and get another one. Granted I was starving."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great atmosphere! Perfect for a casual dinner. Like the chipotle of Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"One of the best American Indian food places. The malai kulfi was to die for.  Great customer service,  unique decor and perfect quantity of food."}
{"text":"Choolah is like Indian Food lite. The menus is really small, it's quick service, but it's good. The cashiers are friendly and understanding if you want no cilantro. I've gotten both the paneer and the chicken and they are on par with any good Indian restaurant.  Just go and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Choolaaaaahhhhh is my jam. Basically think of it as the Chipotle of Indian food, except better. The chickpea masala is a go to move here as well as the yellow lentil soup."}
{"text":"I love the concept, the food is fresh and tasty. I got the chicken tikka masala with roasted vegetables that I added which were cooked perfectly, I hate when veggies are over cooked which they weren't. The tikka masala sauce though left something to be desired, it tastes like they are trying to dumb it down for American standards or something. Anyways it lacks the tomatoe and cream that you expect in this dish. I'd rather go to a real Indian place for the good stuff. That said, it's still a good place to come. The wheat naan was wonderful."}
{"text":"This is a tip for others like me who had never had Indian food before: go with someone who has had it before so they can help you out.  I would have totally been lost without the guidance of others.  A lot of the food was too spicy for me.  I ended up liking my less spiced options of Samosa Chaat and Chai tea."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, and deliciously awesome. I've never been disappointed by a visit here. One of my faves in Cleveland, for sure."}
{"text":"I got a perfect bowl with chicken and veggie masala and it was pretty good! The chicken was super soft but the veggies could've been grilled some more to make them more tender. The proportion or rice and masala is less than what i had expected for the price. My friend got the lamb meatballs and was t very impressed. We also split a samosa chat which was alright but not the best in the area. I'd say this place is more of a 'once in a life time' type of place. I probably won't be going there again"}
{"text":"Fast,  clean, delicious!  Will come back to try everything in the menu! Lol  Had the bbq lamb combo and Chai. The portion was decent. The place is very big with 4 cashiers, so I think they can handle peak hours very well."}
{"text":"This place was good on the chicken tikka and on the naan.  Samosas were awful...the truffle was wet on the inside...overall I don't think $15.42 for one meal was acceptable - as a sit down Indian restaurant would have been more relaxing...and more true spicy not \"would you like hot sauce with that\"?!"}
{"text":"Everything about our experience was amazing.  From the sauces to the straws, everything was high quality!  I'm impressed!  It was so good that I am writing my first review!"}
{"text":"We are big fans of Indian food, so my husband and I were excited when Choolah opened in our neighborhood. Unfortunately, our take-out from there last night was kind of disappointing. It did not seem like a good value (I usually have leftovers for days when I order Indian food, but this was barely enough for dinner, for the same price). There are also not a lot of options on the menu, and the samosas and naan were really week.  I think Choolah could be a good choice if you're looking for a quick lunch or if you're new to Indian food and want to try it out. However, I prefer other options in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place, the hospitality of the staff with delicious food makes it for a great experience most Indian places lack!"}
{"text":"Do you like Indian? I do! This place is not only a fast food place. It's made the correct Indian Way. I like all the spices they put on the food. It makes it so different and different is good! Make sure to buy a package you will not regret!"}
{"text":"This food is delicious. Think kind of a Chipotle-esque process but with fresh Indian food. They have a good amount of variety too, so there's something for everyone. I've even eaten here with someone who doesn't like Indian, and they enjoyed their meal. I love that they have their kebabs roasting behind a glass wall so that you can see. The restaurant itself is clean and parking is easy and plentiful."}
{"text":"Very good and unique indian restaurant. There is a line on weekends and they 45mins free parking right next to them. The paneer is out of the world and very nice and soft. The curries can be better but tikka masala and chana masala are really good. The biryani is an over hype and would say have had better elsewhere. The naan and kulfi arenvery good too. Pav bhaji was average and samosa was decent too. Overall a wonderful place we went there twice in 2 days"}
{"text":"Not impressed. As another Yelper said, she found herself anticipating the opening of this place, only to find that upon going, the experience was not what she'd anticipated. I had a paneer sandwich--which is Indian cheese, vegetables and sauce rolled up in naan. I agree with the Yelper who said this place is like an Indian version of Piada. The prices are steep for what you get, in my opinion. The size of my sandwich was normal--it wasn't like I was \"stuffed\" after eating it. The mango lassi was expensive -- $3.45 or $3.95, and was just okay. It was missing a key ingredient: rosewater--an essential component in a quality lassi. Anyhow--I think my bill was just below $12 for dine-in.   The people were kind and friendly though, and I thought it was cool that you could see the naan being cooked through the glass wall. Food is expensive these days, unfortunately. Maybe with a few tweaks, this place will improve over time."}
{"text":"Excellent food, clean accomodations, loved the automatic hand washer.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We had food at Choolah last week and it was great . The lamb wrap, Paneer Wrap were great and the chicken biryani was amazing it was flavorful and was better than anything we expected. This place is definitely worth going to and am sure will be frequently visited by our family."}
{"text":"My iphone died so I was near this location and had enjoyed it in my previous visit. I arrived around 1pm and it was busy with a diverse group of visitors. I had a great cashier who was patient and explained the menu and order options to me. I got a chicken bowl with wheat naan, and lentil soup. All the items were prepared quickly and when I went to eat them were hot.  I loved that we could add spices and onions, peppers, sauce, it was pricy but good. My only dislike was their coke freestyle machine was hard to operate and the sensors were worn out. Overall please build in Boardman/Youngstown area."}
{"text":"Great concept I highly recommend you go to a real Indian restaurant but if you choose to go here make sure you check your bags if you are carrying it out to make sure that they put all the food in it."}
{"text":"Tasty and fresh food for a decent price. Quick service too. The menu has various options for different palates. The dining room has plenty of tables and the facility is clean."}
{"text":"I'm not entirely sure if this is authentic Indian food but it is quite amazing for the price. My favorite thing to get here is the BBQ meal. The BBQ meal consists of a barbecue meat, rice, a soup and naan (bread). The chicken was not dry. You can also top it with a mango sauce that pull everything together. The spices blend nicely and it's just different. Its not your average chain in Cleveland Ohio. It's a fast food place that serves quality food. The atmosphere is great. The staff was friendly. Great place for college students to grab their next meal."}
{"text":"\"Choolaah\" shines as a concept, and I hope to see more of them pop up around the area before too long.  Described somewhat accurately as an \"Indian style Chipotle,\" it's the glassy, modern, orange-logo building you always see on the way to Trader Joe's or Whole Foods; the one you promise yourself you'll go check out one day, but still have yet to do so.   Take the plunge; it's worth your while.    The restaurant will begin to win you over before you eat.  The space is both impressive and immaculate, with lots of modern touches: high ceilings painted black with exposed ductwork, stainless steel and wood laminate finishes, and windows galore, including ones that look into the kitchen and prep areas.  You'll feel like you should be paying more for your meal than 10 measly dollars.     The ordering experience has been simplified to perfection but not dumbed-down, making it great for Indian food novices and veterans alike.  The minimalist menu features large, colorful photos that break down your choices into a few core categories and one or two simple additional steps.   You'll want to order everything, but alas, you must choose; on my visit, I picked paneer as a \"plate,\" served with naan, masala sauce and rice.    I would stop short of describing the food as \"exceptional.\"  The paneer, while certainly serviceable, was reminiscent of firm tofu in consistency and not as melt-in-your-mouth as I remember the dish elsewhere.  When thinking about this, perhaps rather than a quality issue, it might simply be the natural result of its  \"bbq\" style preparation which could render it less moist than a \"stewed\" preparation.  The naan was more thick and biscuity than fluffy in texture, but still buttery and tasty.  The masala sauce was on the tame side, resembling a lighter soup and perhaps needing a bit more zest.    These minor complaints, however, should not be taken as deterrents: much as Chipotle should not be held to the standard of authentic Mexican fare, Choolaah, similarly, makes its quickness and freshness its selling point, and not its authenticity.  Judged by this criteria, the result is an overwhelming success."}
{"text":"My first experience with indian food was at a place called taj palace that used to be accross the street from the old Randal park mall.  They had a buffet for about 7 bucks and I tried it on a whim and immediately fell in love.  Since then I've made it something of a goal to try new places when I find them and I've been to a pile of them.  The two things that I love most about the dozen or so locally owned Indian restaurants I've been to are the (usually) reasonable cost and the amazing variety of foods available.  This place has neither.  They have fewer options than your average hotdog cart and a meal for one with a fountain drink is about 12 bucks.    I also tend to love the sort of home grown feel of the decor at most of these local places.  This place has all the charm of a chipotle.    Now dont get me wrong.  The food i did have was fairly tasty, but still I'd skip this place.  Do yourself a favor.  Hunt up one of those locally owned mom and pop places and go there instead.  The food will be far better, with a much broader selection [didn't like what you had this trip? There are 50 other dishes to try next time.] you'll be helping the local economy and you will be much more satisfied by your experience."}
{"text":"A fresh concept of Indian Fast food!  Decent taste, good for people who would like to have less spicy, oily version of Indian food. A bit of creativity as well  in the preparation, like a layer of bread on top of a biryani dish that acts as the lid to enable 'dum' technique of cooking! Very impressed!"}
{"text":"I eat here at least 3 to 4 times a month and am yet to be disappointed with the food.Very consistent quality and taste everytime!  They now have a new recipe for their chickpeas masala and it tastes authentic Indian and tastes even better than its predecessor.  I like creating lines from the words stuck on the wall outside the restrooms, their automated hand wash gets me excited everytime and do not miss the row of books underneath the main tables!"}
{"text":"Besides the cool concept,  the cool urban interior, open super clean kitchen friendly staff, the food here is very good. When I first saw the \"Indian BBQ\" sign out front,  I thought twice about going in. As an Indian,  I was afraid that the restaurant was more about the concept and less about substance. Like Chipotle is to Mexican food,  or Piada is to Italian food.  However,  after one spoonful of  their Chicken Briyani, and I was gladly proven wrong.  The Briyani (Chicken Rice pilaf) was baked in a pie. the dough top a nice touch to balance out the spicy rich rice and chicken. The rice and chicken were cooked perfectly, with the right balance of spices, plus you can add  the hot sauce which packs quite a bit of heat .  There's plenty of rice and chicken to satisfy even a big hungry guy like me, and at a reasonable price.  I can't wait to go back and  try some of their BBQ next,."}
{"text":"Amazing Indian food, ample food choices, unusually clean. Open kitchen in an Indian restaurant is rare and they have what it takes to impress you. Every penny is worth it and it's total value for money. Don't not forget to try the meat balls ... meat balls being good in a BBQ Tandoori restaurant are a sign of great chef and recipes behind the quality and taste. Come to CA soon!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst place to got terrable service there very rude the food was bad and had hair in it the place was dirty they didn't wash there hands not clean at all"}
{"text":"This place is a \"must do\" if you've never had Indian cuisine! We weren't sure of the different sauces so the girl taking our order went and grabbed a sample of each to help us decide!!! What service! We ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Meatballs! Both were very good!! We're definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Good food, may be a bit overpriced.   I went while they were somewhat new and it seemed like they were still working out the flow of order and wait.  We got an large order to go and they forgot a few things.  We will go back again."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for lunch, honestly not knowing what to expect.   Fast food Indian, is how it was described.  I was skeptical, but now I am a believer.  Great atmosphere, quite busy, and impeccably clean, right down yo the high tech automatic hand cleaners in the dining room.  Food is very high quality, very well prepared, and good portion sizes.   The menu is smallish, but I suppose for food that is high quality and fast, that's a small sacrifice.   Overall, very impressed!"}
{"text":"Love the business model. The atmosphere of this place is super modern, clean, and welcoming. Its a very high tech place, even has a hand washing station where you just put your hands into a machine for 12 seconds and it washes them! You can see everything in the kitchen through a glass wall.   The lady at the register gave me a tour of the menu since it was my first time, and she was very accommodating to my gluten allergy. I had the lamb meatballs and they were good, the sauces had great flavor. I was very impressed with the service and atmosphere more than the food. But the food was still crazy good. I definitely recommend anyone to try this place out."}
{"text":"I feel bad giving Coohlaah 2 stars, but I think it comes down to the fact that Indian food just isn't my \"thing\". I was excited to come here after seeing a lot of hype on social media about it. The best way that I could describe it is the Chipotle of Indian food. If you are an Indian food lover, I think this would be a must visit!    The atmosphere inside is very trendy and clean. I love that you could see inside the kitchen and watch them make the naan- that was a fun part of dining here! It's also huge, with seating downstairs and upstairs so there is enough room to be comfortable with a large crowd. All of the staff here was super friendly and helpful with the menu & provided a nice experience for us.   As I said before, this was actually my first time eating Indian food so I didn't know what to expect. Chris and I both ordered the \"bowls\", he got the lamb and I went with chicken. The bowls came with rice & the tandoori vegetables as well. You can pick any of the masala sauces to put on top of your bowl, I chose the only one I was familiar with which was the tiki masala. They also had a few sauces to add on the side that were all unique. The sauces were the only part of my meal that were actually spicy.  We also ordered a side of naan that was delicious! The chicken and the vegetables were both super flavorful- I think it was the tiki masala sauce that I didn't love. Great addition to the Pittsburgh food scene if you love Indian food!"}
{"text":"Indian Fast Food!! LOVED THE IDEA This place is very modern and clean and the staff are friendly.. very fun and enjoyable I loved the Mango Lassi and the Chicken Tikka plate My only recommendation is that they should have more variety in the menu :)"}
{"text":"I pronounce it CHOO-LAAH and I am on board the choolaah train! I had heard amazing reviews and I've been trying this new thing where I explore foreign cuisines and become more cultured so why not try this for starters right? It was SUPER clean inside, like immaculate, I probably could have eaten off the floor. There was a line but it was well orchestrated and went fast, ordering was a breeze and the staff was very informative on allergens and nutritional values. I was actually really impressed by that. I got the bbq chicken with tiki masala and let me tell you...this was my first experience with any type of Indian cuisine and I fell in love at first sniff! And to think this place is considered \"faster\" food blew mine. The food is prepped in an open area where you can see them actually making it, the naan is fresh made in shop. The ingredients were beyond fresh and the spices and such made for a mouthwatering experience. I really cannot wait to come back! The prices were great and you really do get a bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"Great food and beautiful dining area but kind of pricey and they charge extra for sauces.  I eat there a lot."}
{"text":"chipotle-style indian food. got the meal with chicken tikka and samosa chaat. nothing like new york traditional indian restaurant food but still yummy"}
{"text":"One of the best Indian places in town, a healthier and fresher version of Chipotle. Always great service and gray food!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic. The food is mouth-watering, it is super fast and the interior is clean and modern. Try their chicken Biryani and tikka masala. Also their samosas are delish ! The staff are polite and helpful. Strongly recommended, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I'm N E V E R disappointed, except once all my scrumptious perfectly delicious food is gone. Then I just want more! Choolah is SOOOO GOOD!!!! Omgoodness. Fresh. Flavorful. I get samosa chaat w/no sugar and biryani. Or lamb meatball and tikka with extra rice, but every single freaking thing on the menu is delicious! Go for the mint raita with your food. Ooh, so good (and refreshing) Choolah must be hindi for YUMM-O."}
{"text":"Food was great. Naan was not as flavorful as I remembered, and it was burnt. They gave me another but that was just less burnt..."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! I make sure to eat here every time I'm in town for work. Delicious, fast, and great prices along with a super friendly and helpful staff. Wish we had this place back home in NY!"}
{"text":"First thing aftr hvng d first lunch bite, wish they can hv a franchise in chicago.. loved d whole ambience abt d place frm the time we entered .. they make kebabs infront of u .. very clean place.. d meals r a good deal.. absolutely loved d chicken bbqed.. and a small tip : dont miss d kulfi and fiery mango sauce(Chutney)"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place hasn't been franchised out yet. Fast service, good American-style Indian food for reasonable prices."}
{"text":"First time here. Quick and good food. I had the lamb with yellow lentil. The Mrs had the chicken with tikka. We will be back when in the area"}
{"text":"The food is so good for the price. The service fast, place clean and good parking space too. My first meal I ordered the bbq plate with chick pea chicken and whole wheat naan. The naan was perfect. It's been a long time since I've had one like this outside north India. They give you atleast 3 types of chutnis. The mango one was simply delicious. My friend likes their grilled vegetables and mint chutney. My next meal was with lamb. The kebabs were so well made and tasty. I was surprised they actually make Indian food which appeals to my Indian palate as well not the bland Americanized version that is so rampant everywhere. And yet the major patrons were white Americans. So this food satisfies everyone. And best thing... 9.99$ for the whole platter."}
{"text":"Completely in love with this place! The concept is genius = an upscale takeout version of classic Indian dishes. Their naan is seasoned perfectly and goes great with their spicy mango sauce. They also have this cool hand washer that sanitizes your hands in 12 seconds and saves water usage. Again, genius."}
{"text":"I LOVE INDIAN FOOD. If you read my other reviews, you will know this too.  I finally tried this place out, and went in with an open mind knowing that this is a \"fast-food\" style Indian spot. It has the Chipotle feel. Once I entered, I was greeted by smiling faces and the girl at the front counter walked me through the menu options. Limited but good, I went with the Tikka Masala chicken bowl and my friend ordered the same. We also ordered the Samosa Chaat. The main entree comes separately and you kind of assemble the thing together. The Masala sauce was good but really unauthentic, I mean I wouldn't guess it was Indian food if I wasn't told. The chicken was too chewy (fatty) which I really dislike. The samosa chaat was OK, but still underwhelming-- I guess I've had too many authentic samosa chaats in my life span...The naan is good and I mostly dipped that into the masala sauce. I ate about 1/2 my dish before calling it quits...  The place is very clean, and fresh. The decor is very modern and beautiful. As much as I wanted to love this place, I just couldn't. Prices are fair though, you can eat for about $10."}
{"text":"Solid quick Indian. Don't go their expecting the experience  of a regional Indian restaurant with many options. Great healthy options for a quick bite for lunch or a casual weeknight dinner."}
{"text":"I was in the area working and found this place on Yelp. It is a gem. The menu has a good amount of options, but is simple and easy to follow. The price point is fair and the food was amazing.  Here working for 4 days, I will be back again this week."}
{"text":"It is what it says it is ... Fast casual Indian .. The naan was very good and so was the tikka masala sauce.  The salmon was good as well.  The lamb meatballs very dry and no flavor and no white meat chicken .. Not good in my book.  The service was great and it is a cool building.  So, it's not going to be as good as my favorite Indian restaurant, but works for fast casual.  Real problem and why it got three stars is the value prop is not there.  In my opinion the prices are way too high for the quantity for my Bbq dinner.  The bowl may be a much better value.  So no white meat chicken and high prices = 3 stars.  That said ... worth a try because not sure I have ever seen Indian fast casual anywhere... Even LA."}
{"text":"Stars are for service only.  Fantastic service by the way. But the food...  Bland does not adequately describe it. There was an absence of flavor to a degree that I've never experienced with Indian food. It didn't taste bad, just flavorless."}
{"text":"Love the Choolah bowl and the naan. All their protein options are great. Only gripe I have is the Choolah in Beechwood, OH has the Choolah bowl with naan included for the same price in Pittsburgh for the bowl without naan."}
{"text":"Everything was great ! I received the wrong order they quickly fixed it after I told them Love the mango lemonade"}
{"text":"The chicken bbq tikki masala is amazing and I could eat it all day! Super fast service and friendly employees!"}
{"text":"I came for the soft opening and my meal was complimentary. My meal was delicious and a perfect blend of textures and flavors. I got the chicken perfect balance bowl. The meal would've been a bit pricey for a student, but it could've been split into two meals had I tried a little harder :) They offered samples of all the masalas and all were delicious. They also offered a sample of the mango lemonade, which I ended up getting.   The ordering was quick and easy, the layout was modern and spacious, and the staff were friendly and helpful. I will be returning as a paying customer.   My meal was to-go, so don't let the atmosphere and poor lighting in my home deter you!"}
{"text":"The food, staff and price is great!!!!  My family loves to come here to eat, well worth the drive from the west side."}
{"text":"For dinner last night we stopped into this place that was decently packed even about an hour prior to closing. I had previously checked yelp reviews, because this food can be hit or miss. All the pictures looked delicious and the smells coming from inside this place would make anyone hungry! Not to mention when a restaurant is full and has glass to see food being prepared from start to finish.... (making of naan in large stone barrels, BBQ of meets, preparation of each meal) I love it!!  You have multiple different options which is great . I chose the veggie croquettes with, white rice,  tikka masala and it also comes with naan. In addition I ordered a chai tea. My husband ordered the BBQ chicken bowl with tikka masala, white rice, and naan. Then the restaurant offers a small beer and wine selection, that consisted of 4 beers and 4 wines, one of which was chosen. Our buzzer was given and we were immediately surprised at how large the actual dining room seating area was , because there was a whole sunken area in the back next to a patio area. Our wait was extremely short for our food, but during that time I never saw any employee just standing around doing nothing. The designated employee ( I am assuming) to clean the dining area never stopped. He moved tables, cleaned the floor( debris), took trays, cleaned empty tables. Even during some evaluations I don't see restaurants employees take this much pride in their jobs. Nor see everyone working, it shows not only great management, but pride and respect for the company. I think it's what showed in the product that was received. My croquettes were slightly crunchy and flavorful. I have to admit I was a bit nervous upon cutting into them because I wasn't expecting the mashed inside. The description given at the counter was that of a falafel. Yet, to my surprise, they were extremely enjoyable. My only recommendation was the sauce was not quite as warm as I would have expected.  Hands down the best Indian food that I have found since being in Ohio, especially for the price!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a really cool fast casual Indian concept. Large dining area inside, nice large communal table and a nice patio outside. Large windows to view the kitchen, with large tandoori ovens front and center. Nice modern artwork on the walls, cool hand wash station and coke freestyle machines. Staff is very friendly and their menu has great options for meat lovers, vegetarians, vegan and gluten free. You can pick some if their signature bbq bowls and salads or you could build your own.   We ordered the choolaah salad with salmon (power greens, pickled onions, tomato, cauliflower, chickpeas, raisins, paneer cheese). Wife opted out of the paneer cheese. Also an order of the tandoori veggies (roasted onions, peppers, cauliflower, zucchini). Also I built my own bowl with lamb meatballs, paneer cheese, brown rice with Tikka masala sauce. Both came with wheat naan on the side. Also tried their samosas (stuffed with potatoe, peas, exotic spices). And to wash it down I ordered a mango lassi (Indian alphonso mango and Punjab yogurt). Everything was absolutely spectacular. Super fresh, perfect layers of seasoning and the wonderful char from the tandoori oven was awesome."}
{"text":"Best food ever! Fresh and tasty! Trendy! I am a Michigander who never misses an opportunity to go to choolaah when I am visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":"Best chicken tikka masala ever head, optimum spices, great taste, not heavy on belly, other tasty things to try are Naan, Mango sauce, Mango kulfi and ice cream."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!!  I'm a tough critic of Indian food and am especially down on Americanized places. This place is fun and the building is beautiful.  The dishes are not traditional but our flavors that taste traditional. I wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The line was a bit crazy on peak hours but likely due to opening weekend. Amazingly authentic and quality food. I'd avoid the the samosas, they were terribly disappointing but the bowls were so fucking good that I'm still giving them 5 stars. Also, the wraps were not enough food for a meal but they were excellent as well. The crew was energetic and friendly."}
{"text":"Fast and good. Had the lame balls and worth a try.  Clean and frendly, the lady behind the counter helped us with our order and did a great job."}
{"text":"Let me tell you why my girlfriend is a genius.  She is not the type to eat the same thing all the time. She loves variety and experience and flavor. We get along quite well for these reasons, amongst many others. So when we decided to meet up at Choolah for dinner, we wanted to try EVERYTHING. So, instead of each of us getting our own things, drawing a dividing line across the table, being left to wonder what the other is experiencing, mouth-wise, my brilliant better half suggested we get multiple dishes and share it all. She is, on a scale of 1 to 10, the best.  This. Place. Is. The. Shit. For me, the Paneer Tikka Masala absolutely stole the show, followed up by the Chicken Biryani. We also had Samosa Chaat which was heavenly, and a delicious and refreshing Mango Lassi. Everything was accompanied by some incredible sauces that you could get from a serve-your-self style condiment bar. (I still dream of the Tamarind Apple Sauce. It haunts me in the best possible way.) Even the rice was on point.  Service: Excellent. Decor: Modern and inviting. Prices: A little on the higher end, but you absolutely get what you pay for.  Prepare yourself, Choolaah. My better half and I will be returning sooner, rather than later."}
{"text":"Food and service was good. Set up and dining sort of feels like Chipotle, so good option for something quick and casual."}
{"text":"Choolaah is going to be a national hit. I love coming here for a quick lunch. We are vegan and can find one thing on the menu to eat. I wish they had a few more options. My kids love the lentil soup and naan.  I don't doubt that this has the potential to be the next chipotle. I wish it was a little less noisy."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!! one of the best asian foods in ohio!!"}
{"text":"Best Indian \"fast food\" ever!! It's cheap, fast and healthy. You can park on the right side of the restaurant for free if you don't take too longer. It's modern, clean, easy to take out since you can pre-order on-line. I would recommend samosa which is a deep fry dumpling, mango lassi (which is not that sweet compared to other restaurant) and salmon that is moist and tender, very delicious!!"}
{"text":"Living across town, this is one of our favorite destination restaurants for Indian cuisine. But recently with certain changes to the food preparation, not as much.  My fav used to be the lamb meatballs but now they're too spicey for me. I love it when management responds to their surveys (Choolah's requests on every receipt). My wife recently contacted them about her BBQ Chicken Bowl she ordered for takeout, dry and off taste. She immediately got a call from management and today, about 10 days later, received a gift card! Excellent response and client services! Beachwood Ohio location."}
{"text":"Choolaah hosted a preview dinner for all Eastside Bond residents tonight (they are located in the complex itself on the first floor) and it was a wonderful experience. This wasn't samples only or one entree and a cup of water per person type of deal...the owners clearly have faith in the quality and taste of their food and know people will be coming back in droves, so the entire menu was available to try free of charge!  I'm allergic to dairy so I stuck with the vegan options, of which there were many. I built my own bowl with vegetable fritters, chickpea masala, yellow lentil daal, and rice. I also had the samosas and a mango lemonade. The fritters were a flavorful and filling meat alternative, and the masalas were deeply flavorful and generously portioned. I enjoyed the crispy samosas as a side, although my bowl was so filling that I couldn't have finished both items if I tried! The mango lemonade was the perfect alternative to the mango lassi I couldn't have (miss those!) and I didn't feel as if I was loosing out on delicious mango flavor at all.   The space is airy and brightly lit, making for a pleasant sit down experience if you so desire. The service was also quick and friendly, perfect for an environment like this. Overall I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu. I'm certain I'll be a regular from now on."}
{"text":"The selection is decent and the food is really very good. They make the naan right there and the entire kitchen is behind a glass; so I love the transparency, no pun.   Seating is really interesting and cool. They have 4 top tables but the main dinning area consist of two really long custom made, natural wood tables. This facilities family style dining, even with strangers.  For the food is is pretty authentic except the heat has been dialed WAY back. I would like to kick it up a notch but the authentic taste is pretty much in-tact and it is wonderful.   Summary This beautiful little spot is clean, bright and vibrant. The food is really good and the atmosphere is bright, clean and inviting. I would relate this as a direct parallel as being the Indian version of Chipotle."}
{"text":"Wow!  I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed Choolaah.  I have been wanting to try this place for some time and finally got an opportunity.  I stopped in on a weeknight.  There was a steady crowd.   I ordered the Chickpea Masala, Samosas and Naan bread.  My order totaled approx $10, which was a deal in my book.  The portions were generous.  The Masala was nicely seasoned over perfectly cooked rice.  The Samosas were tasty, as well.  A bit less traditional than I'm used to, but tasty, just the same.  The Naan was hot and fresh.   The accompanying sauce, cilantro yogurt maybe?  was bright and fresh.  I very much look forward to my next visit!!!"}
{"text":"So, I absolutely LOVE the food and I've gone here multiple times. But, one day I went with my 4 month old baby and I used my stroller. A worker watched me struggle to get into the door. He didn't even offer to get the door for me. Then, I had to push the stroller while carrying my food tray and the manager saw me struggling to do both and just watched me. Seriously!? He literally WATCHED me. You can't offer to help? You're just standing there. And it was definitely the manager because I met them the day they opened. He's tall with glasses. He's lucky I was in a good mood that day. Then I went to leave and no one offered to help me again as I struggled to get out the door. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Super amazing food. Made fresh. A different and new experience with great food and environment."}
{"text":"Choolaah feels like it could belong in the California Bay Area. Besides the fact that it's filled with suits from companies all around the Beachwood area, the decor is both modern and inviting. Good job, designers.   I love the simplicity of the menu and helpful photos. For a first-timer, I'd definitely recommend the meal option: depending on what BBQ meat or vegetables you get, for under $10 you'll have a bowl of soft rice and tender morsels, a cup of sauce, a condiment cup of cold mango chili, and a fresh piece of sesame, garlicky naan. After ordering, you'll get a buzzer - although my food came out so fast I barely had time to walk to the drink dispenser and back. If you do have to wait a bit, not to worry - watch your food being made through big glass walls around the kitchen.  Damn, is that naan good. Like REALLY good. Dip it in any of the sauces, including the hot sauce (self serve near the utensils), and you'll be wishing all your favorite fast food restaurants offered naan next to their French fries option. I'm no judge of authenticity, but my Chicken Tikka Masala bowl tasted reaaalll good. I wish the sauce was a little thicker and hotter when I got it, but I'll have to go again during an off-time to see if the consistency changes.   Before you dig in, and after you're done, use the \"hand jacuzzi\" next to the utensil station to prep your fingers for some naan-ripping action! This is the first time I've ever seen one of these stations, but it's essentially like a two-holed Dyson airblade. Stick one hand in each opening and lukewarm water is squirted all around your hands. Shake 'em off, dry with some paper towels, and prepare to eat.   The innovation doesn't stop there. The communal table you see just to the right of the registers? The asymmetric bars running down the center are actually the pages of books embedded in the table - check under the table and you'll see the books. The topic of whether the books are real or not is a source of much controversy, and you should go to decide for yourself. In the bathroom, you'll find more clean, sleek design. The sink is a modern-take on those bamboo-style faucets, and even the baby-changing station was made of brushed steel on the outside. If you're one of those people who hate touching doors after washing their hands, there's a foot-pedal at the bottom of the door for you.  There's plenty of seating - and most of it was full when I went - but I ended up sitting in the converted garage area downstairs. It was a sunny day out so we caught some rays and nice views of... the Whole Foods across the street. I finished my meal feeling satisfied, but not bloated or heavy. Naan, I'll be back for you."}
{"text":"I was so excited to check this place out. It is like an Indian qdoba. The nah was very thin and crispy, I had chicken protein and I forgot the sauce name but it was one of the most popular one. It tasted really really good! The portion was huge! I think it would be even better if it opens at downtown! The place is very big and nicely decorated in a modern style. You can see how they bake the nan though the glass wall and I head that the technology they use to bake the nan is over 1500 years old and it is nice to see how they can apply this traditional technology to a modern restaurant.  Would definitely come back and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Indian version of Chipotle and it is amazing. The flavors are incredible and the ingredients are fresh. The staff was very friendly and the food was ready much sooner than expected, given how busy they were"}
{"text":"Well.  I don't know.  I'm a indian food junkie.  I can be your pushaman when it comes to getting your curry fix. Overall it's not horrible. I just have some issues  First off it's tough to make indian food \"chipotle\" style. Indi kitch in nyc tried to do it and well ...eh. I think for Pittsburgh this place is fantastic because you need something like this...regardless of location. Quick and easy Indian food.   I ordered almost everything on the menu to try in order of best to worst in my opinion:  Pav Bhaji. Awesome. Like it's homemade Samosas or the chaat: like moms   Kudos  Paneer wrap: great just like a Kati roll from Nyc  Biryani: for such a complex dish they nailed this one! Good job.  Lamb meatballs : not bad. Tastes like the ones they served on united emirates flights to Dubai. This is not an insult people.  the food on emirates is amazing. The largest airport based kitchen. Seriously. It's really good !   Now the lower end. The tikka masala curry isn't bad it's just not great! The chicken is perfect. You have that authentic smoked tikka taste but the gravy I don't know what it is something is lacking. The rest of the wraps and stuff I just couldn't get into it. Stuck with the above foods and you'll enjoy it   Just my two cents."}
{"text":"This is my third visit here and the price for quality and quantity is fabulous. The chicken lettuce wrap was fresh and sumptuous. The chai had the nice spice but could have been a little hot. The pav Bhaji was tasty and filling. Kids enjoyed the nan and the mango lassi. Service is efficient. Worth revisiting."}
{"text":"Fast food Indian. Delicious options with friendly service. You can customize your meal, the they give you a a buzzer to let you know when it's ready.  I didn't care for the music, which I thought was too monotonous with too much drumset.   There were plenty of condiments to choose from, mango, mint, and a couple with hot level warnings that were actually not all that hot.   The samosas were a little disappointing, you would do better at a conventional Indian restaurant.   One tip about the garage next door, if you park under 45 minutes, it's free."}
{"text":"About 1 year ago, upon my initial visit, the food was great! It was served STEAMING HOT & freshly prepared- you could tell that the food was genuinely prepared by someone who cared. The last 2 times i came, they have unknowledgable young American female teenagers working the order and cash registers, the food is BARELY warm, and SOOOOOOO DRY (barbecue should be JUICY!!!) and the food must have been 3-4 hours old.  It was NOT FRESH and must have been from lunch time. I came around 5. The Indians sure are getting waaay too miserly. I will not be returning- 2x I paid more than $30 for my orders, and the food ended up wasted. Too bad Choolah, you lost me as a customer. No longer a Choolah-head. VERY DISAPPOINTED SINCE I AM AN INDIAN-FOOD FANATIC. will find another place in town."}
{"text":"An update from my previous review, this place is delicious and continues to tweak the menu with great success.  Very much enjoy the masala and chai."}
{"text":"At the recommendation of the incredibly cute and friendly girl working the counter I went with the paneer sandwich and was not disappointed! It was really tasty, especially when you got a bite of melty paneer, veggies and some of the yogurt mint sauce all in one flavorful bite."}
{"text":"Loved the food! You need to put one up in Mentor!! We had two awesome vegetarian dishes and will be back!"}
{"text":"This place hits it out of the park! Truly delicious. Fast service. Amazing quality and taste of food. Super friendly. Wishing we had one in Buffalo NY. It would be a huge hit! Congrats on an amazing establishment.x   PS. The ice cream is a must!"}
{"text":"Impressive for Cleveland! Would love to franchise concept in Los Angeles! It would be a hit! The set up, menu, staff and design were all remarkable. So clean and contemporary. The food was fresh and tasty. Happy to see such diversity and a really concept in Ohio, of all places."}
{"text":"Fabulous food! Beautiful open place. Can watch food being cooked open and contemporary feel.  The Choolaah  guy recommended a chicken,lamb, and cheese dish and I ordered it to go for a party of 4. Everyone loved the selections! Go! You won't be disappointed! Margaret Pug Beachwood,Ohio"}
{"text":"Choolah has a variety of spices and sauces to choose from they never disappoint. The staff is excellent very attentive, knowledgeable and very pleasant."}
{"text":"So many great options here. I've tried many things - the tikka masala with lamb, the veggie croquettes, many of their wraps - and liked all of the various options. In fact I would order many things on their menu again.  Even better are their \"snacks\" - the samosa chaat is phenomenal and the pav bhavi (think and Indian sloppy joe) was excellent.   The kids also like the options on the childrens' menu, especially the naan pizzas.  Finally, recommend both the mango and mint lemonades.  We've been multiple times in Pittsburgh and have always had a good experience."}
{"text":"Vary tasty food! Easy to order. Reasonably priced. Very good for kids. Great place for some fast Americanized Indian food. The interior is clean."}
{"text":"At first glance, Choolaah looks like a Chipotle so I was instantly drawn to it, but when I read the sign it said Indian cuisine so HAD to try it! I've never heard of a fast-casual Indian restaurant, nor never ate Indian food by choice (there aren't many restaurants). Once I walked in I spoke to the manager at the register and he said this is the first location, but they are looking to put another location in Virginia within the next year.   The menu has a lot of choices, but I went with the go-to and recommended chicken bbq bowl with tikka masala sauce and wheat nan. My husband got the same, but with lamb meatballs. The chicken was also served with a side of chipotle mango sauce and the lamb came with a mint yogurt sauce.   We poured half of our masala sauce on our dishes which were served over a bed of rice. We ate the rest of the masala with our nan. Wow! It was awesome. My chicken was nice and tender and the meatballs were on point. The sauces really tied the dishes together. Plus the portions were huge and they were priced relatively well ($8-9). I now live in North Carolina, but if I still lived in Ohio I would become a regular.   The atmosphere of this place is also awesome. Again it reminded me of a fancier Chipotle. What I loved the most is that there is a glass wall where you can see the people preparing the food along with the fresh ingredients in the fridge. They also had a nice outdoor patio and the restaurant was a pretty good size.   Overall I would highly recommend Choolaah for anyone who wanted to try Indian food for the first time or just try something different!"}
{"text":"Very good menu options. I've eaten here a couple times and the food is cooked to order and tasty. Their naan is soft but had that slightly charred flavor. The chicken was well seasoned. The grilled veggies were still crisp, which is good, but I would like them to be cut into smaller pieces. It was hard to cut with a plastic knife."}
{"text":"The food was tasty and the people were amazingly friendly! I attended the Yelp event here with a great DJ, solid food, and even got one of their great PGH tshirts!   Our group ordered a variety of menu items and shared everything. Top of my wishlist was the tiki masala, and it was good! We had chicken and white rice and the flavor was delicious and that portion plus naan would have been well enough for a meal. A great vegan option is the cauliflower and chickpea wrap - it had great flavor! The owner also provided a small portion of the chickpea soup, which was fantastic (and also vegan)!  Other dishes we tried at the table included the Croq Choolaah Salad with tamarind ginger dressing and the Paneer Choolaah bowl with yellow lentil sauce... both also very good! What we loved about all the options were the distinct flavors and then the options to add the sauces to spice them up. We also tried the two kinds of lemonade available, mint ginger and mango. The mango was very mango-y (that's a word, right?!) and the mint ginger was just a hint but was very refreshing.  So the food: Good! Now, the atmosphere: everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful. The space is very open and offered a variety of options for seating both on the main floor and upstairs in a loft. The open kitchen and modern decor make it a nice place for a quick meal or to sit and chat. I also read that it is a BYOB, so next time I think I'll have a nice bottle of white wine to go with my spicy dish!"}
{"text":"This place was so trendy. I loved the food and the atmosphere. I got the lamb meatballs they were very good. The lady I orders from suggested items for me and what sauces to use. I went with my friend and their food came out before mine and my food took a little longer because they got busy. They ended up giving me and my friend a free ice cream for my elongated wait (which wasn't that long). I would defiantly go again. Best part was the hand washing machine. Also parking is free in the garage for the first 45 min."}
{"text":"I usually order from there when I am at work because it's so close and I can just walk there. I always get the lamb wrap and samosa. It's so good and the sauces they use is killer. The staff are friendly and smiling which is always a plus"}
{"text":"It was a little intimidating when I came in to order, but once I figured out how it worked, it was awesome! I chose a bowl with veggies and tikka masala. We also got the samosas. Indian food is my fave and to have a place like this where it's quick makes it even better.  A really great additional to the Pittsburgh food scene."}
{"text":"This is going to be my new favorite restaurant in PITTSBURGH. I did a delivery so the food was a tad cold and the curry was mixed with rice due to how it was packed in one bowl. But even then the taste and flavors were the best of any Indian restaurant in US. Outstanding meal, I had paneer and veggie BBQ with rice and tikka masala - finish was top notch."}
{"text":"Came here for their soft opening today and could not have been more impressed! As soon as we walked in, the place was immaculate, smelled delicious, and was organized! The food was AMAZING!! I got the pandeer and my bf got the lamb. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Service is good. Clean. Great set up. Love the design, floor to ceiling windows to the tandoori ovens/kitchen, hand wash station is super cool. I've been here a few times now and the food is consistently good. Pricing is good.Definitely will return and will recommend."}
{"text":"I currently reside in a town with zero Indian food.  So, when I came to Cleveland and saw that there was an Indian place minutes from the hotel, it was an obvious choice for lunch.  I proceeded to be boring and order chicken tikka masala.  It wasn't as spicy as I would like, the the flavor was great and the chicken was nice and tender.  I was disappointed I didn't order naan-- it looked delicious.  The space itself was very clean and pretty, and the employees are friendly.  Cleveland probably has more authentic Indian elsewhere, but for a unique, quick lunch under $10, this is a great spot."}
{"text":"First thought... Chipotle, Indian style! The references on previous posts make evident that I'm not the only one who noticed. Pretty awesome new place. It seems Chipotle has really inspired food entrepreneurs to emulate their model. And, why not?... It works! With that said, it'll be difficult to post a review without making comparisons to Chipotle. Although, the ordering process is a bit different. They take your order at the counter and they give you a pager. Your food is prepared in the kitchen, which is visible behind this glass wall. They have these vase-like stone ovens where they grill the meats. Pretty cool! Tried the chicken tikka, biryani bowl, mango lassi and choolaah chai. All were very good. Chicken was very well prepared and very flavorful. Love the spices and the touch of cilantro. Prices are a bit higher than Chipotle - and because of this, the only thing I can think of that may have been lacking for me was that I wish Choolaah would have been a little more generous with their portions. Will definitely be back.   Tip: try to wrap your head around how the long table made with books in the front was made."}
{"text":"Spectacular!!!! Best indian place I have ever been to so far. Clean, spacious and very fast service. The food os great. Wish the portions were bigger though"}
{"text":"Creative, fun, unique! Food was great and served up quick. Staff was informative and friendly. A welcomed addition to foodie neighborhood of East Liberty."}
{"text":"Very spicy. Very crowded. Do not recommend coming here. I want to like it, but I just don't."}
{"text":"Meh...it's ok...sort of....  If I'm there, I'll eat.  I won't drive out of the way for it.  Not bad, not great...I think that is actually what they strive for."}
{"text":"Traditional indian food staples, with spice levels adjusted to American pallet...Overall a very original, well executed concept!"}
{"text":"Went there once all they did warmed up frozen Indian food and gave it to me it didn't taste like Indian food then I never went there ever again."}
{"text":"Is it subliminal messaging that Choolaah starts with Ch-? it seems like they are really going for the \"Indian Chipotle\" vibe.   I was already deep into my Friday night by the time I came in here so I was a little overwhelmed by the many choices on the menu. But it's actually pretty simple: to build your own bowl, choose a base (rice or salad), choose a masala, and choose a protein. I chose rice with tikka masala and the vegan croquettes. It was so delicious and the portions are HUGE!  Then, once you get your bowl, the fun part begins. You're free to pile on as many sauces and toppings as your heart desires from the DIY toppings bar. There are 8 different sauces and they're all fantastic! Be sure to try the mango sauce: it tasted like biting into a fresh mango!  A lot of people are complaining about lack of heat, but I can understand them not making the base curries too spicy so that they can appeal to everyone. If you want some heat, there are two different levels of spicy sauce. I put lots of \"Choolaah fire\" sauce and chopped jalapeño on my bowl, and it tasted perfect.  If you don't want to build your own bowl, the biryani and samosa chaat (samosas with sauces) both looked really good. The biryani is served like a pot pie with a layer of bread over it--never seen that before!  The space is very bright, clean, and cool. And though I'm no expert on authenticity, there were several Indian families eating here when I was here, so that's a good sign! Overall, Choolaah is a cool addition to the fast-casual landscape, and I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here. I'm not well-versed in Indian food, but the people working here are more than happy to answer any questions you have. I got the veggie croquettes with tikka masala, rice, veggies and a side of naan. I really enjoyed all of the flavors of my meal and can't wait to come back. The interior of this place is super fun and hip. There's big glass windows that show the kitchen and the tandoor ovens where they prepare the meats and naan. There's also some self-serve sauces available and its fun to try them all with your meal. The only downside here is that the cost can add up pretty quickly with sides, appetizers or drinks, but the price is well worth it in quality."}
{"text":"Great new try in the area. Drove down Chagrin during a visit to the area and couldn't help but see this new massive, sleek looking building. I made it a point to visit during my next visit to the city. I agree with existing reviews about how the ordering reminds you of other franchise chains. The food is well spiced, but not hot. This restaurant would do good with delivery services such as DoorDash or UberEats when they are available in the area. Won't have to worry about explaining how spicy you want your food and they already provide good packaging for Togo orders."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved my food.  I ordered the lettuce wraps with chicken.  I wanted to try the mint yogurt sauce so they swapped one of the included sauces for it and I am so glad they did.  The naan bread was hot, fresh and oh so tasty...all the food was.  This will be one of my new go to easy lunch places.  Well done!"}
{"text":"Awesome Indian food! Was my first experience with Indian cuisine and Choolaah did not disappoint. The chicken tianca was amazing as well as the naan. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great food. Didn't know what to expect. It's a ready to make sit down dining. Place order, then they call when ready. Open view of kitchen to what they cook. I had lamb, wife had chicken, really good and the Nan bread is amazing."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!  So good!  I highly recommend Choolaah!!  Ate lunch there today with my daughter and everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"It probably helped that we were pretty hungry when we pulled into Choolaah, and that we absolutely adore Indian cuisine and that this particular itch hadn't been scratched in quite some time, but we loved this place. Everything about Choolaah - the design, the layout, the food - has been polished to perfection. It's Indian food fast-casual style and it was simply brilliant.  Everyone else has said it so I guess I will too...this place really does have some sort of cool vibe to it. I know it's totally manufactured and I'm cool with it. It's open, bright light streaming in all over the place, incredibly clean and all interior designed out the wazoo. The kitchen is completely open, you can check out all the big ovens as they're making your food. Plenty of seating. I know it's the sort of place that should feel like fast food, but I actually wanted to linger.  Walk up to the counter, order your food, take a buzzer to your table and wait to be called up. Don't worry if you're not all that knowledgable about the menu. They're very friendly and willing to walk you through everything if you let them know it's your first time. Rice bowls, wraps, , an Indian type of pot-pie that uses naan as the crust, drinks like the yogurt smoothie of India called a lassi, beer, wine. The menu will have you stuck in indecision land. Just try something, don't be afraid.  We wanted to try everything, and it felt like we did. We both got our own BBQ bowls. I went with the chicken, brown rice, Tikki Masala sauce and wheat naan. My wife got the paneer cheese, brown rice, yellow lentil daal, and garlic naan. We also got the Choolah salad with tamarind ginger dressing and a side of pav bhaji (three sorta sweet rolls, buttered and flat-top grilled with a bowl of spicy potato soup and some onions and chili peppers for sprinkling). You get plenty of tasty sauces to experiment with - spicy mango, mint yogurt (this one packs some heat) - they've got 8 different sauces to choose from. Try them all, just be careful. If it has \"fire\" in the name, well, that's on you.  Everything tasted so fresh. The depth of flavor they've managed to accomplish with their deft use of spices and those tandoori ovens is simply amazing. My chicken was tender, juicy and perfectly charred. My wife's paneer cheese was soft, a bit chewy, and also had some nice char. A subtle smokiness pervades everything and it's awesome. Seriously, this stuff was so good I'm on the verge of drooling on my keyboard just thinking about it. Another great thing, you can get the complete nutritional info for everything on their menu. Surprisingly, it's all pretty healthy. You'd think something that tastes this good can't be good for you.  OK, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the handwash station out on wall. Yeah, it's a gimmick, but it is pretty fun. Just stick your hands in and water jets whirl around them, getting you all sparkly and germ free. I don't know how effective it is, but it did feel pretty strange and tickly. So I guess there's that.  There you have it. It's just really, really good Indian food in a - dare I say it - beautiful space that's served fresh, quickly and deliciously. I have a feeling it gets a bit crowded around lunchtime, given it's proximity to all of the businesses on Chagrin, so get there early and go often. Now, if we can just get them to open another location closer to downtown..."}
{"text":"Really a fantastic place to get introduced to or just enjoy some Indian style food. I first came here during the first week or so that it opened never having Indian cuisine in my life.  After getting a nice explanation from the overly friendly staff and doing my best to determine what I would like, I indulged in the chicken with rice bowl along with the naan bread and the tikka masala.  All of it was absolutely fantastic.  I don't get a chance to come here as much as I'd like, but the food is always consistently great and the service friendly.  Just wish they had some level of spicy beyond what's currently offered!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time ever going here and it was SO GOOD! It's built into an old Saturn dealership, so this place is super spacious for a fast casual place. The food is incredible, service is nice, and got great vibes!!!!!! Best bbq I've had in a minute!!!"}
{"text":"I walked in and I swear I could've mistaken this place for a trendy lounge or bar. This disguised that fact this is an affordable Indian fast food concept that borrows from the Chipotle model. I had delicious, tender, spice-marinated, mouth-watering chicken barbeque with Tikka Masala sauce on the side with Basmati rice. I also decided to splurge a little on some Mango Lassi. Total Bill? Somewhere around 13 bucks. Not bad. Not bad at all. My taste buds were dancing, and so was my wallet."}
{"text":"Choolaah please come to Minneapolis!  I loved everything about this place, and I suspect a lot of you do too. All sorts of groups were eating and taking out on the night I ate at Choolaah, and this hits a wonderful sweet spot of being easy/safe enough for the people in your life who may not eat a lot of Indian food (Hi Mom!) and a full kids menu for your pizza needs and being purely awesome for those of us that just need get our tikka on. The menu is obviously not as complex and varied as a full Indian restaurant (and with good reason; Indian dishes are often harder to master and more complicated to cook than many cuisines) but what they are doing they are doing very very well."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, super fast and not expensive. It's the Indian version of chipotle  Service was awesome too  Will be going back for sure"}
{"text":"My first time coming here, I didn't know what to expect. I was a little confused by the style of ordering, and unsure what the food would taste like... Then I walked in and everything was crystal clear. The staff is very friendly and can walk you through everything, should you have questions. The food is flavorful and plenty. I don't think I've ever finished a meal in one sitting here! The naan is unbelievably good and the building itself is incredible!"}
{"text":"Just wow! Choolaah was busy for a later weekday lunch, which clearly speaks to the quality of the food. We were so impressed by everything from the menu to the service. It's amazing to see into the kitchen, how the food is prepared, even someone chopping fresh veggies. I had then BBQ bowl with vegetable balls, they reminded of of the inside of samosa, and were delicious with mint yogurt sauce. My meal also came with a large portion of rice, chickpea masala, and naan. It was a ton of food and I couldn't finish it all. My husband also had a BBQ bowl with chicken and masala curry. He was equally as pleased as he's a huge fan of naan and this met his high expectations. Choolaah is a fast casual joint, similar to the \"chipotle\" experience but with much higher quality food and service. We can't wait to become regulars and try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Choolaah is pretty much the Chipotle of Indian food--once you know that, you're good.   The space has a lot of simple tables and booths for seating both on the first floor and the second with a \"sauce\" station and an interesting queue of tablet stations where staff take orders.  The staff friendliness and engagement with the menu is definitely a high point here. Staff will walk new guests through the process of selecting/building different bowls and will even offer samples to help guests make decisions. Staff seem knowledgeable about the sourcing of ingredients.  Prices are reasonable and the menu is diverse, vegetarian friendly, and all of the items we tried were fairly high quality for fast casual dining. There are things, like the nan and samosas, which were a little disappointing if you are someone who regularly frequents some of the Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh. But the bowls where you get to pick your protein, add-ins, and sauce were a great idea and made it easy for everyone to enjoy their favorite. They have great flavored lemonades, which is something different, and some \"street snacks,\" like the pav bhaji, which they describe as a vegetarian sloppy joe. Not something I've seen elsewhere!  It's been super crowded every single time I've been in there and when it's humming at max capacity it's pretty loud and can get a bit messy. Parking is a pain, but if you're sure you can get in and out in under 45, the garage next door is free."}
{"text":"This place is so addicting! Despite being busy every time I come here, the service has been fast! The food is very consistent and tastes great every time. Choolaah is such a great addition to the area.  I usually get the BBQ combo with chicken, tikka masala, and naan. The combo is so filling! The chicken is seasoned well, tender, and has a nice smoky aroma. The masala sauce is very smooth and packed with flavor with very mild spiciness. The naan is soft and has a bit of crunch on the outside. Eating everything together is such a pleasure! Recently, I've noticed they upped the size on the sauce! Also don't forget to try out some of their hot sauces near the cool hand washing station.  I've also had the lamb and salmon which were all equally delicious but the chicken is go to. I really hope that Choolaah expands to the Westside!"}
{"text":"I finally found my jam in the Burgh! I've lived here for 4 years and have missed a good Indian restaurant. I'm not looking for anything fancy here, just simple fare, made well that I can count on to hit the right buttons on the nights I don't feel like cooking after a hard days work. Boom! Choolaah gets it bang on! They don't have an extensive menu. A few simple dishes, done right.. with the flexibility to ratch up the heat or not if you're like me. I was in heaven! Paneer - mmmm.. Chana - ohh yeahhh.. Dal - oh my god yes! .. you get my drift.. lol! The Naan is delightfully light and fresh.. it really is the next best thing to eating in a Punjabi home. Don't miss their sauce/chutney station. Oh and the kulfi! I loved their decor too.. and their \"hand wash o matic\" gets them extra points coz of course, you're gonna get in there with your hands and lick the curry off your fingers one by one."}
{"text":"I think this place has a cool concept but I wish I wasn't paying $20 for your meat, sides and sauce. For that much I was expecting a lot more to be on my plate but there wasn't. This place is good if you want something easy and fast."}
{"text":"Quick and tasty Indian fast food with a chipotle style to it. Got the chicken bbq meal for around $10 with naan and tikka masala. Chicken and naan were seasoned nicely. Food overall was filling. Can't really get Indian food anywhere else this good and this quick."}
{"text":"Indian fast food at its best! Definitely one of the best places we tried in Ohio while visiting. Place was clean, and the naan along with the masala sauce was delicious!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian and vegan friendly! And not only friendly, but multiple options. Consistently good service and quality, return at least once a week!"}
{"text":"My dear Choolaah,  It's taken me too long to write this, I know. I just want to say with words what I've said for so long with my wallet, namely, you're very special to me. Sure, you won't be the next Chipotle*, but you're going to go places. Thank you for converting a failing Saturn dealership into a haven for classy fast-casual Americanized Indian food. When you reach the stars, I'll look up at you and proudly say, \"I was there with you, at the beginning.\"  Your tikka masala. Flawless! Well, admittedly, I do grab a couple of Choolaah Fire to kick up the heat. I think it's hard to go wrong with chicken, which is grilled exceptionally well, but my wife fawns over the salmon, which I cannot fault her for. When I'm in the mood to experiment with your other sauces, namely the Spicy Mango, Tamarind Ginger, and Raita, I always purchase a chicken biryani. And no matter the entree, you'll always find naan sitting happily at my side.  Oh, I should mention your service. Have I ever not received a cheery smile at the counter, and not just because I'm handsome? Of course not. Have I ever waited more than a few minutes for my order, even an order of eight entrees? Of course not. Because you always know, deep down in your heart, when I'm on my way. Have I ever regretted driving twenty minutes from University Heights to see you? Of course not.  That drive will happen again soon, I promise.  Yours, Keith  *Americans just aren't sophisticated enough to eat Indian food with any regularity. Your owners know this, which is why they placed you next to a Whole Foods, since Whole Foods patrons are typically more cultured than the average consumer. Brilliant."}
{"text":"We had high expectations for Choolaah but were very disappointed. First, the portions are very small. For $8-12 per meal we expected to leave full and that was not the case. I ordered a chicken dish and it was pretty slimy. Almost seemed undercooked. My favorite part of the meal was the $1.25 nan that I added on to my meal. 3 stars for fast service and decent sauces, but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Fair priced and good food.  I recommend the CHICKEN with NAAN BREAD and TIKKA MASALA SAUCE.  The lady who took our order was very friendly and helpful. The place is huge and the automatic hand washer was fun."}
{"text":"So good! First time here and it didn't disappoint! Great prices, dinner for 2 was $23. I ordered the bbq bowl with chicken, regular rice, regular naan, and tikka masala. for these bowls you have the choice between around 5 meats, regular or brown rice, regular or wheat naan, and choice of masala. Everything was delicious. Tender chicken, buttery tikka masala, buttery naan, and it came with an orange sweet and spicy saucy on the side which was really good also.   Simple and cute inside. It was fairly busy but the staff was quick and very nice. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Why hasn't Choolaah come to NY yet?! The concept of Indian fast food is genius, and the food here is delicious for both the price and the speed it came out in (my meal came out in just two minutes!).  My boyfriend and I shared a side of samosa chaat and customized our own BBQ bowl, which included large chunks of paneer cheese, brown basmati rice, rich tikka masala sauce and a side of naan. Although Americanized, everything was full of flavor. If you aren't interested in their signature BBQ bowls, you can also order biryani, salads, tandoori wraps, various sides, and desserts. The restaurant also has some classic Indian beverages - I had the \"Choolaah Chai\" tea, which was good but needed a stronger masala spice flavor in it. My boyfriend had a mango lassi, which he loved but said was very filling.  On top of the food, Choolaah's interior is bright and clean with a great open concept - you can even watch employees baking naan and cooking tandoori through the large glass windows in the front, which is always fun."}
{"text":"Delicous food, I'm not a fan of the portion size for the price."}
{"text":"I love Indian Food.  This place is absolutely fantastic. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala.  So good. The grilled chicken was tender and delicious.  I would highly recommend this place and that dish."}
{"text":"We must have driven my Choolaah a million times before we stopped in. We usually eat at Bowl of Pho when we hit the east side. Boy was I happy Bowl of Pho was closed on Tuesdays because we went in to try Choolaah! First thoughts was...someone put a lot of work into this place. I love how you can see right into the kitchen and prep area.  We grabbed a menu but had no idea what we wanted so we just walked up to the register. We must have looked confused because the gentleman with glasses asked if it was our first time. He called to the kitchen for some samples. Smart move, dude! We tasted them and YUM! So we ended up ordering what he suggested. We ordered Veggie Masala & Chicken Biryani.   the colors were amazing, The smell was awesome. The taste was out of this world! I suggest grabbing a spoon. So much easier to eat this yummy food with. We ended up going back a week later to try the chicken Tikka Masala and a side of Veggie Masala.   Choolaah is a must stop if you are heading to the east side of Cleveland."}
{"text":"The Chipotle of Indian food -- but better.   My guess is that in five years this restaurant will be known nationally."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh has good Indian population but not a good Indian food. I ve been searching for a good one for a while now. This is by far the best Indian food in Pittsburgh. Its open kitchen style, menu with combo choices, modern set up and ambeince makes this the best. But the best part of it is the taste is really good.. as close as a good homecooked Indian meal."}
{"text":"Great service, great food.  Met what I think to be the owner the first week it was open and he was cleaning the place, asking customers how the service and food was and holding the door open for people.  Love to give people business that deserve it.  The big bonus was the food was also great and the people behind the counter were extremely courteous.  Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Totally surprised to find an upscale Indian version of Chipotle in Cleveland. Good choices on the menu, enough to satisfy any palate. I ordered both the lamb and chicken bbq along with bbq veggies. Great flavor with the wheat nan light and crisp."}
{"text":"Finally made it to this place. Went here for lunch, it was definitely busy but there was no wait at all. The space itself is really cool and very clean, there is outdoor seating available. The menu is a little overwhelming but our \"ambassador\" was very helpful. I got the chicken Choolah bowl with the tikka masala and added the naan. It came out really quick. The food was excellent. They had lots of sauces that we tried out as well. Was really impressed with this place and with the amount of options they have available, I will probably be back many times. They also are apparently a BYOB so there's that too. Use the automatic hand-washer, it's fun."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Came in on Tuesday evening to find a relatively long line, 15 minute wait. We ordered a chicken and veggie wrap and it takes another 10 minutes before it's ready. I don't care so much about the prep time, but the product that I got was a cold mess.... Yes, cold. The cauliflower and peas were around room temperature.   The wraps were small and very lackluster. The naan didn't wow us, tasted like what you get at the store. The portions were small, so when part of the broken wrap (yes, the middle of my wrap was broken off) fell on me and onto the floor, I almost cried because each bite counts. The taste is a bad fusion take on Indian food, not the flavors and spices you find in real India cuisine.  Not as fast casual as you'd think. Maybe after the hype, it'll be less of a line and zoo inside."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I sometimes drive 25 minutes to this place, and it's worth it. Their chicken wrap and bbq entrees are great -- the naan is fresh, crispy, flavorful, and the meat is never dry. They also have great mango lassi and awesome kulfi!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Someone to greet you at the door, helpful friendly staff, clean atmosphere, yummy food! I got the tikka masala & paneer bowl, lentil soup, and samosa's. All delicious and was offered hot oil if I wanted spicier.  I'll be returning again."}
{"text":"Choo Lah never disappoints! Everything is so flavorful and spicy. I hope they open more locations in the future!"}
{"text":"My 2nd visit - was not impressed, quality and value going down - portions are getting smaller and taste is diminishing- would not go back -"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS EXCELLENT! Love the food, prices, location and style of the joint. They hands down have their Indian food together. I highly recommend this place for a quick bite, dinner with a co-worker or some other event. They even have a very cool hand washing machine which you should try before eating!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Awesome awesome! Amazing food, amazing menu, amazing workers, amazing decor!!!!!!  I dream about choolah!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I generally enjoy Indian food, my problem is usually the restaurant itself: cleanliness, staff attitude, atmosphere.  Choola was above all my expectations for an Indian restaurant and the food was amazing. As I walked in I noticed the cleanliness of the place, everything was spotless. Restaurant cleanliness is very important to me and I wasn't let down, at an Indian restaurant of all places! :) It was my  first time there so I asked the cashier to help. She recommended the lamb meatball meal with the tiki masala sauce. The food was PHENOMENAL! I don't say that about many foods. So many different flavors, all individually good and even better combined. The naan bread was perfect. The cashier even came around to check up and see if the food was satisfactory which I have never experienced in an Indian restaurant. The icing on the cake was the \"jacuzzi for your hands\" which is their hand washing station, it just washes your hands but it's something new and different that just adds to the wonder of Choola. I love it and would definitely recommend to friends. In fact, I already have. :)"}
{"text":"A little pricy and limited options on their menu   but delicious foods and nice environment"}
{"text":"Well today was my first time there plus eating Indian food.. It's was Great my Dr ordered it for the office today to tell us she appreciate us all. And one of the other girls ordered for me it was taste.. believe me I will be going back since it's in walking distance from my job."}
{"text":"For a place that opened less then a week ago they seem to be running smooth. Was excited to see it was quick serve.  Easy to understand menu for people that are used to indian food and newbies. Nice portion, good heat when I asked for hot sauce, food seemed high quality. Very friendly staff and beautiful space. Only item that could have been better was the Rita, but for .50 who cares."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times now and have yet to be disappointed. The food is excellent and the staff is super nice and helpful in figuring out the menu - which for a first timer can be overwhelming. Anytime I am in the area I make a special stop! Always happy to stop in and get the lamb meatball bbq meal with tikka masala... Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"I've always been wanting to visit Choolah. Finally, I got the chance to.  IT. IS. OUTSTANDING.   First, when you walk in, there are people who take your order with iPads- super modern and cool! The menu is big so there's a lot to choose from. You pick a protein, a base, and then you can choose any sides or drinks for extra if you want. They also have biryani (chicken and veggie) and wraps, as well as kids meals. They also list if the entree is gluten free, vegan, or vegetarian. There's something for everyone here!   The food- EXCELLENT. I chose the perfect balance bowl and added lamb meatballs and extra tandoori veggies to it. The perfect balance bowl comes with tandoori veggies, 1/2 rice (I chose brown), and 1/2 masala (I chose the yellow lentil daal). The lamb meatballs were flavorful, moist, and juicy! I also could not believe that they were gluten free too, because most meatballs at restaurants contain gluten. But these ones didn't, so that was awesome! Next, the perfect balance bowl was superb. The tandoori veggies were yummy and perfectly seasoned and grilled. The yellow lentil daal was good too. Also, there's a sauce bar where you can add sauces like mint yogurt sauce, or assorted hot sauces. They are freshly made at Choolah and taste wonderful. The extremely spicy sauce is the way to go if you're daring like me and can handle the heat, but if not, try the refreshing mint sauce. You can also add chilis and onions and even lemon to your food, if you wish. I added the chilis of course!  The service- great and very fast. The person who took my order was pleasant and bubbly, which was nice to see. The food is ready quickly, so your mouth won't be watering for too long. There's seating by the kitchen so you can watch the cooks prepare your food. It's interesting to watch!   Overall, you should definitely check out Choolah if you want an extraordinary dining experience. I really want to try the mango lassi or kulfi (Indian ice cream) next time. I will be back!"}
{"text":"If I said the smell here reminds me of India, it's actually a compliment. I know, for those of us who have travelled to India, it may not be a good idea to mention the smell. But I'm referring to the smell of food. As any fast food place, this place is efficient but in a very friendly manner. There is a hand washing station just like India. There is an awesome drinks machine, not like India. The seating areas are well.designed and all the windows make the place quite open.   Oh yeah, the food is really good. Too bad, I wish the menu is more extensive."}
{"text":"I am so happy that the Cleveland area finally has an Indian fast casual restaurant. I loved this place, probably because I'm Indian....  It's not as good as some of the more authentic Indian restaurants, but it definitely is close. I ordered the paneer plate with naan, rice, and tikka masala. The food was spiced well, although not too strongly so it's not overwhelming. The portions are appropriate. I felt I had enough to be full, but not too much where I left with a stomach ache.  My husband enjoyed his chicken as well. I can't wait to try the chai next time!  I also enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant. It's clean, modern, and also has some unique features, such as the long table with books hanging underneath. The coolest thing is the hand washing machine...you'll know what I'm talking about once you try it. The staff were so friendly and I enjoyed being able to see the kitchen through the glass windows.  This west sider will definitely be trekking back to the east side for some Choolah!"}
{"text":"Very tasty entrées. The naan is a bit small for the price, but I'll just not get it next time around. The mango lassi was most yummy and countered the heat of my entrée nicely.   The large, glass sided dining area amplifies sound a lot. Avoid it if there are children in there that don't know what an inside voice is. Also avoid the room because parents let their kids treat the stairs and bannister as a playground."}
{"text":"this place is amazing!!! great atmosphere and great food!! its like and indian chipotle but with a kick and they have great deserts!!"}
{"text":"It's good. Like a Chipotle for Indian food.  Price is slightly higher than I would have liked but the portion size is good.  They also have outdoor seating which is awesome."}
{"text":"Dear Choolaah, please take my money. I don't think there's another restaurant where I could feel so good about going out to eat, and for so many reasons.    Here's the backstory for everyone else:  They had me at \"fast-casual Indian BBQ \" and then I learned about everything else...  I was extremely lucky and was able to get an early preview of Choolaah thanks to a few great people. With that said, 3 things to note:  *1: I visited prior to opening, the staff was still training and as such..I can only imagine things will continue to improve.  *2: I don't actually know how things could get any better, but I'll certainly be returning again and again and again when they officially open.  *3: I'm so excited about Choolaah opening that I fear people will think I'm exaggerating in this review. I'm not. You'll understand when you visit.   Food:  You can read about where they source and prepare all of their ingredients if you're into that sort of thing. And if you're not, you can just be amazed by how great everything tastes.  Dietary Needs:  Anyone can eat here. Vegan, Gluten Free, Kids...most any dietary guideline can be met, and not like most places where the vegetarian and/or vegan option is an afterthought. Anyone will have ample options to choose from regardless of dietary restrictions.   Price: You can eat for under $10 and given the quality and sustainable ingredient sourcing..that's kind of amazing (Bell & Evans Chicken, Halal Lamb, Amish made paneer cheese, spice shipped in from India and blended made on site, tikka masala that takes 6 hours to prepare....you get the picture)   I would guess most people would be in the $10-$15 range for lunch or dinner and walk away quite satisfied. That estimated price ranges includes the Mango Lassi that you will want to try.   Environment:  Choolaah is worth visiting for the design alone. They are a \"chain\" with 4 other locations, but this place is uniquely Pittsburgh. Even the tandoor ovens have Steelers names on them, but not in a try-hard gimmicky type of way. Many PGH locals were involved in this project and you'll find references to Andy Warhool and other locals tastefully woven into the design.  **there's a message in binary code in the tiles on the second floor. I don't know what it says, but I'm eager for the first reviewer who figures it out.   Philanthropy: Let me pause for a second and just recognize that philanthropy is such a focus for Choolaah that it got it's own section. They're giving back in so many ways that I could write a separate review on just that.   Or you could just google it Or listen to this podcast with one of the founders  Is it against the rules to link to the podcast where I first found out about them? Going Deep With Aaron Watson interview with Co-Founder Raji Sankar (interesting fact, the same owners also own several Five Guys franchises...including the Oakland location).  I'll update again after they open, because I really can't wait until they open."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the neighborhood. Choolaah offers a wide variety of quick, Indian options at an affordable price in a fun environment. The tikka masala was great with the available sauces and the chicken was very juicy. The naan was also great with some crisp garlic on it. Choolaah also offers many vegetarian options. To top it off, the owners were interested and engaged with customers to make sure it was a good fit."}
{"text":"Albeit inconsistent, the food is pretty good. I will say I personally wish it were a bit more spicy. Staff is very nice.   Inconsistency and the price are what get me. You're looking at a minimum of $10 without a drink or naan. I am happy to have another quick healthy-ish option in the neighborhood, but not crazy about the prices, so I will probably find myself still hitting up Chipotle once I am over the novelty of it.   Also just like no one would ever call chipotle real Mexican food, don't expect this to be 100% authentic Indian food either, although it does get sorta close. Disclosure: I no authority on Indian or Mexican food, just a fan of both cuisines"}
{"text":"The other people I dined with love this place but I prefer a more authentic Indian experience than a fast food place like this. I felt it lacked the flavor and spice of a more traditional Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food. Restaurant is clean and employees care about the customer. The lettuce wraps is my favorite and is a perfect meal to showcase what this place can offer!"}
{"text":"I like the food.  As casual Indian take out is concerned it's great.  I like the options that they give you for the meats.  There is something for everyone here whether you eat meat, eat fish or are vegetarian.  I usually get the chicken masala.  Yums!!  My only complaint today comes from their website.  I work in the area and figured I would save myself some time by ordering online.  I and my co-worker got all the way to the pay portion and the website errored out on us and wouldn't allow us to move forward.  That issue alone was the deciding factor to miss out on great food today.  Please fix.  There are many people in the area that are only out on a short break that would like to partake in your food but cannot do it because time is limited."}
{"text":"Indian approved! As a person who lives and breathes Indian food I'm very picky when eating out. My cousin had mentioned this place and said it was really good. Subsequently her and her husband brought me some paneer tikka and naan. I enjoyed the huge pieces of paneer. I went again with a friend and below I provide descriptions.   Samosa chaat: classic Indian appetizer and I loved how it tasted here. Definitely need to try.   Paneer tikka: the paneer pieces are big and yums! Best combination ever it comes with your choice of naan and rice (white or brown)   Lamb meat ball: personally would not get this as I don't like lamb in this form. My friend enjoyed it. I would get the tikka masala.   I wasn't able to get the other masalas but definitely will try them if I am ever in the area. However, you can never go wrong with tikka masala!"}
{"text":"Choolaah is a truly original restaurant. Starting out, the renovated car dealership building gives off a creative design, using glass to showcase the \"back of the house\" and city environment outside.  The line moved quickly, and the staff was friendly.  After placing the order and receiving the restaurant pager, the wait was no longer than five minutes.   The food itself is fresh, exciting, healthy, and delicious.  For around ten dollars, Choolaah's meals offer a flavor-packed barbecued meat along with traditional naan bread and a choice of soup; the large meal comes additionally with numerous choices of sauces to customize the food.  Some additional bonuses include the following: a Freestyle Coca-Cola machine, spacious tables, and a \"jacuzzi for your hands\" cleanser."}
{"text":"Great place. Great ambience and great service. I was little skeptical trying this place mainly because I am from India and was not sure if they good satisfy my taste after having tried Indian food in the US almost everywhere from New Jersey to California and Texas.  This is not your typical Indian style but more of chipotle style Indian fast food with great taste and flavor profiles. The food was simply awesome. Coming from and Indian you can take it as a done deal. The Chicken Tikka bowl was perfect with the tikka sauce. Biryani was great. Salmon...Did not even think that it would be that good.   I tried the paneer sandwich and felt the bread was too soggy. But still giving 5 starts for rest of the items and service. I am pretty sure they will introduce more sauces as they grow.   Fantastic food. Please don't go to this place expecting something similar to your home cooked or regular Indian food. But, the taste and flavors are as good as they can get for this set up.   Great Job."}
{"text":"Excellent decor and ambience! Superb Tikka and BBQ stuff. I wouldn't go there to eat chickpea masala but would definitely go again for their delicious meats and kulfi."}
{"text":"We love coming there to eat. Everything is so fresh and healthy. The restaurant is seven clean."}
{"text":"While I previously had decided that I didn't enjoy Indian food, Choolaah made me more open to liking Indian food. I was pleased that the offerings included different levels of heat. I myself prefer low heat and I was satisfied with what I ate. The seating was a fun, open concept that allowed for all sizes of parties to converse. It was however, a bit hard to hear over everyone's conversations."}
{"text":"Very interesting indian fast food concept. Extremely well maintained place. They have the authentic looking electric tandoors. The meet was cooked perfectly. The tikka masala tasted amazing. I loved the rice combo where I got rice bbq chicken and tikka masala as gravy. We also ordered a vegetable masala as a side with wheat naan which tasted good too. I hope they make it a chain"}
{"text":"Disappointing but not surprising. The food here should not be confused with what really comprises Indian food which is very varied and calls upon a number of ingredients, spices , and cooking techniques. This really is Americanized Indian fast food. When I ate there I did the choice of protein (lamb choola bowl with tikka masala) , rice, naan, and a mango lassi. I'd only go back for the mango lassi. Somehow they managed to muddle the flavors to the point that I couldn't quite tell what flavor profile they had intended other than fast food. The glory of Indian cooking is that even with the number of spices they use you can actually taste those individual spices whereas at Choolah they blend into blah. If the prices were much lower, I'd say OK a quick other than hamburger fast meal but when you pay for one entree what  you could pay for an entire Indian lunch buffet with better cooking, Choolah goes into the 'not worth it' column in my book."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Choolaah and my husband and I were quite pleasantly surprised!! We can be picky about Indian food bc his family owns Indian restaurants but they're a bit of a hike for us to get to. Choolaah was a great, affordable way to get those flavors!!!  The restaurant itself was clean, chic and had ample seating both inside and on the patio. The staff were very friendly and professional, which is always a plus. Definitely casual but we really enjoyed sitting out on the patio with our (LARGE!) trays of food!   I actually still cannot believe how much food we got for the price! We each ordered the BBQ meal bowls (I had the paneer and he had the chicken) which came with naan, sauce of choice (we both had the tikka masala), rice and your \"protein\" all for $8.99 each. We also ordered the samosas, and quite frankly it was too much for us to finish! Haha When my husband carried the trays out to our table I was shocked at how much food it was!  It was really delicious!!! I would definitely recommend saying \"yes\" to the complimentary chili sauce on the side and add it to the tikka masala if you're wanting that \"Indian kick\" to the tikka masala, otherwise it's a little too mild for our tastes.   We really enjoyed our meals and will definitely be coming back again and SOON! (The hand jacuzzi after eating is also a MUST try!)  OH! And we really feel that you can tell that the owners pay attention to the reviews bc I had noticed that some of the older reviews mentioned bland naan or things not benign spicy enough, and we both were then surprised to find how flavorful the naan was and then knew the chili sauce on the side was a necessity!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to grab a bite to eat because of the quality of food and the convenience."}
{"text":"Delicious real food! Fast! Friendly service! Clean! Modern! Simple! I will definitely be returning. My picky daughter loved it too! What more can I ask for.   Wonderful :)"}
{"text":"Where do I even start. This is the best fast food/Indian food I've eaten. The food here compares to the my Egyptian grandmother's."}
{"text":"MAN OH MAN were we impressed with Choolaah! First off the smell when you enter the building is phenomenal, second the table with book pages as the center is incredible (you have to see it to believe it), and the food was amazing!! The service was friendly and fast and there are plenty of spots to eat. If you've had Indian and love it or if you're looking to try it for the first time I recommend Choolaah! The Mango Lassi is a must have!"}
{"text":"Great lunch today. Staff was very helpful in assisting with selections and knowledgeable on the ingredients. We enjoyed the BBQ chicken with tika masala sauce and really good naan bread. The biryani with chicken was also yummy! Fun to see the food being prepared in the tandoori ovens. Great addition to the fast casual scene in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Food is very healthy and they have a lot of different choices on the menu. This place is an Indian style version of chipotle with an extremely nice interior."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! What a great addition to Pittsburgh food scene! I have been secretly hoping for a great fast casual Indian restaurant and it looks like my prayer has finally been answered:) Besides awesome food, the place has a hip decor and feels spacious. I have tried their paneer and chicken bowls and both are to die for. They source their paneer (indian cottage cheese) from Amish farms and its one of the smoothest I have ever tasted. Chicken and paneer are bbqd to perfection in their tandoor ovens and you can add grains/salad/condiments of your choice to make a wholesome meal. But choose your sauces wisely as a couple of them are pretty hot. I haven't stopped thinking of Choolah's food since past few weeks and that means another trip to Shadyside! Yayy!"}
{"text":"I have visited the place yesterday. Choosing menu was little bit complex since they have lots of options.   Atmosphere- The place is very clean and fency. All staffs and onwers are nice. They have passion for what they do.   Foods- The foods are very authentic and tasty. Lots of tasty sauces are available   Speed- It was taking 13mins to get a lamb meatball wrap and Choola bowl with a naan. Little slow but it is not boring since I can watch their cooking processes. Employees might have learning curves at this moment since they started leas than three weeks.   Overall- Indian Chipotle"}
{"text":"Choolaah is an interesting place.  Located in a former car dealership on Chagrin near I-271, the decor is silver and black, modern and clean.  The staff is friendly and helpful, you order and get a buzzer for when your food is ready, and you find a place in the large dining area.    The food is a modern presentation of traditional Indian food.  You can get bowls, sandwiches, salads or a plate.  I choose to have the veggie croquette plate with the regular naan and the chickpea masala.  The food was ready in about 5 minutes; I picked up the nice portion of food.  The highlight of the meal were the veggie croquettes, 3 nice sized balls with a crispy exterior and a flavorful interior with potatoes, peas and cauliflower pieces.  The sweet dipping sauce and a little hot sauce made for a very satisfying main course. The basmanti rice was nice, but nothing special.  A good sized portion of chickpea masala was nicely spiced and well prepared.  I have to say I was a bit disappointed with the naan; most of the time naan is one of my favorite parts of eating Indian food, here it was just ok.  The naan itself was a bit boring, although the salt and spicing on top helped.  One unique experience is the hand washer unit by the condiments; I gave it a try and it was a bit funky and left my hands and arms wetter then I would have liked.  Choolaah is a bit different then most other Indian places.  There is some good and some just OK.  Worth checking out to see how you like it."}
{"text":"The food is tasty. Value is good. The only thing holding me back from leaving 5 stars is the fact that Choolaah won't let you customize the sandwiches. Apparently the sandwiches/wraps are pre-made."}
{"text":"Clean and modern design of restaurant.  Polite and quick serving staff.  Food is fresh and flavorful.  I especially enjoyed the Chicken Tikka Masala, Samosas, and Naan."}
{"text":"Such delicious, straightforward food. The restaurant design is also very interesting. If I didn't know that it used to be a collision repair center previously I never would have guessed.  The only way Choolaah could improve would be to offer a less expensive, smaller serving of the tikka masala sauce (it's around $2 and way more than I need to top my grilled chicken). Other than that - all good!"}
{"text":"I came on a Friday night and it was pretty busy. I ordered tikka masala bowl with brown rice and tofu, and pav bhaji. My friend got the samosa chaat. I couldn't decide between 3 or 4 stars for this place. I love the concept but the food was just fine. The tikka sauce was pretty bland and with just tofu and rice it wasn't anything special. The pav bhaji was good, but the samosa chaat wasn't. I do not think I will be coming back here. For the price you can get much more delicious and authentic options elsewhere in PGH"}
{"text":"Lamb meatballs are outstanding.  Beet salad with lamb meatballs A+.  Not sure it would be worth the price without meat though.  Get the tamarind ginger dressing with the salad.  Naan bread is delicious. Be sure try it with the mango or mint sauce.   Lentil and chickpea soups are both tasty too.  Finish up your trip with a little  mango ice cream but be sure to get a real spoon. The one in the cup isn't worth a darn."}
{"text":"Excellent concept! Excellent food! Highly recommend. I tried paneer tikka, was quite good. The Samosa's are bit bland (probably as they are trying to cater to all and not just Indians). Kulfi as desert was also excellent."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here the other day and so enjoyed it. I personally love Indian food and was so excited to see a new Indian place opening up near us. We both had the tikka masala and were happily impressed with how tender and juicy the chicken was and how perfectly creamy and spicy the sauce was. We also really liked the decor. For sure worth a try!"}
{"text":"A chance encounter gave me the opportunity to sample Choolaah's fare before their grand opening coming up on November 28th, and I was very thankful for that chance after looking back on the visit!  The manager I encountered was incredibly kind and had good service in mind throughout the entire experience.  She showed the open windows that looked into the kitchen to allow guests a chance to view the cooking ovens in action along with their walk-in refrigerators and freezers to get an idea of the quality of ingredients in use before any order could be placed.  After giving me a quick overview of the menu, I picked the Tikka Masala bowl with chicken and a side order of Wheat Naan.  I was given a buzzer and told the food would take about 3-5 mintues to prepare and pick up later from the side counter (similarly to Panera's buzzer-based pickup system).  The service was much quicker than that expectation, but the place also wasn't open yet either!  Always having regular Naan at any sit-down Indian restaurant that I have been to previously, I wasn't sure what to expect with the Wheat Naan nor did I have anything to compare the quality towards having been a first-time try, but I was very pleased with the taste.  The bowl was also delicious and the fresh ingredients were apparent in the flavor.  I was given the option to make it spicier, but turned that down for my first try.  The default spiciness was a great level for me, but I worry that Indian-food newbies might be turned off from it if they don't know what to expect.  The only constructive criticism I could come up with was a lack of sauce in the bowl compared to other Tikka Masala orders that I've had at other restaurants, but it is only a less-than-minor concern at best.  The price was definitely closer to a sit-down restaurant than to a quick-serve joint on the scale of fast-casual restaurants, but I don't think they'll have a problem with justifying the prices as long as they can continue to keep the quality of the food high into their opening and regular business.  I'll still be planning to head there again my first day back in the office following their opening on the 28th!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is hip and the space is beautiful, but the food is very bland. Worst Indian food I've ever had. I won't be back."}
{"text":"A Friday lunch search led me to this place. From the the layout is very modern looking with many windows. Inside is quite modern as well and and very clean layout.  The menu has a fairly large variety of items to chose from. This trip I order the lamb meatballs with white rice naan and Tika masala sauce.  You get a large amount of masala and 3 meatballs. Added tip, make sure to grab some of the spicy sauce if you'd like an extra kick!  The food itself was very tasty. Nice mix of flavors for an Americanized fast food version of Indian food but it stays in its lane and does its thing. I'd get this meal again and I'm more than likely going to try many other items on the menu. Service was pretty good and the hand wash machine is pretty cool.  I recommend this place and will visit again in the future."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the whole buzz around this place. There are so many better more authentic Indian food in Pittsburgh.  I found this place busy, slow, over-priced and not tasty food.  I don't think I will really go back again.  Even tho that I really appreciate the lady who took my order who was super nice and friendly.  I would say that was my only positive experience there."}
{"text":"This place should be in Cincinnati.  They have quick and yummy Indian food.  The place is big and inviting with glass windows that allow you to observe them making the naan bread in the huge clay pots.  I got the Chicken Tikka Marsala, an order of samosas, Naan, and a mango lassi.  The Marsala was nicely favored and not at all spicy.  There are 3 samosas that come in an order.  They were fresh and paired well with the cilantro sauce that came with it.  I live for a mango lassi's especially on hot days.  But this one I could have done without.    Overall this is a good place to stop if you are craving inexpensive, yummy, and quick Indian food."}
{"text":"High quality, freshly made, quick, tasty, and good service. What more could you ask for? I haven't had much Indian food in Pittsburgh but this place really hits the nail on the head. Great new fast casual option for the east end and Pittsburgh as a whole!"}
{"text":"Indian Chipotle is awesome. Fast-casual, American palate friendly Indian food. Cool, clean, modern decor. A freaking hand bidet or whatever they call it. What's not to love?  My go-to is the chicken tikka masala bowl with naan on the side. The rice, nice and soft. The chicken, tender with a satisfyingly smoky flavor. The sauce, mild yet extremely flavorful. The naan is the perfect add-on to dip and finish the leftover tikka masala sauce.   It's so good I can't bring myself to try other things on the menu, though that chicken pot pie style biryani looks interesting.   I will say the samosa is kind of lacking, and the menu overall is a little pricey for what you get, but I suppose it's region appropriate.  Do yourself a favor and give Choolaah a try. You don't have to be a fan of Indian food to enjoy it."}
{"text":"Unlike any Indian I've ever had! No sloppy mess. Fresh ingredients with great flavor. I really liked the variety of options - from traditional Indian fare (like Tikka Masala) to sandwiches to lettuce wraps (yay low carb choice!). The staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. It was clean and bright, and the prices were very reasonable.   The one thing I would have liked would be to be able to pick your spice level. I probably would have kicked it up a bit.  If I lived near here, I'd be a regular for sure - even just to pick up a hot chai!"}
{"text":"Wow! Delightfully delicious. Great price. I highly recommend...Thanks yelp! For helping me discover this wonderful place!  We had chicken BBQ chicken, and tikka masala! So so good."}
{"text":"YUM. This place is like a Chipotle but for Indian food. There are several options and the portion size is good. I ordered two mango lassies because they were so yummy. There is plenty of seating area and parking. The space is clean and I wish they would open a branch in Michigan.."}
{"text":"I went to Choolaah's soft opening and was very impressed. I'd been reading about this place for over a year, so was anxious to try it. The first thing that struck me about the place was the ambience; the artwork on the walls is interesting, the space is huge and airy, and you can see into the kitchen, where the cooks work with big tandoor ovens.   But, even better is the food. I tried the lamb choolah bowl, the lamb meatball wrap, and finally some samosas along with excellent mint sauce. All of these were great, and there are still many other interesting options I want to explore.   Finally, all of this comes at a great price point considering the great quality and taste. As I was leaving, the wonderful staff happily thanked me for stopping by. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Food was OK, but very little value for money here. I can see how it might appeal to the younger crowd of fast food users, but it just didn't do it for me.  There was a young boy sitting at a table as I walked by I heard him say to his dad, \" this is so not worth $10\" My sentiments exactly."}
{"text":"I'm glad to find another unique casual dining option in the Eton Place/Woodmere area, not to mention one that expands an already diverse group of offerings.   As I wrote in my tip, don't be afraid of the menu. The model deconstructs the menu so that even those unfamiliar with the ingredients and flavors of this genre of cuisine can order confidently. That said, I played it safe by ordering a \"sandwich\" - chicken. For the price of another \"ethnic barbecue's\" burrito you can have one of these. It's not as impressive in size, but it's every bit as delicious. (BTW - my college buddy and juvenile late lunch partner just chimed in with a perfectly timed \"that's what she said.\")  With a very modern yet comfortable, spacious and casual dining room (outdoor seating too!), and child friendly menu items like naan pizza, I could see making this a frequent stop. Definitely worth checking out. Very friendly service too..."}
{"text":"This place is innovative!  The moment you walk in, you realize this is not your typical indian restaurant. The building itself along with the marketing deserves accolades.  I found myself wanting to buy their tshirts.  The tandoori ovens are openly displayed and are quite a spectacle.  The menu is concise and you wont find saag panneer or aloo gobi here. What you will find is well executed \"barbecue\" chicken, delicious tikka masala sauce and nearly perfect naan.  There are no waiters, you order at the counter so its similar to a \"panera\" concept.  I cannot wait to go back and try the lamb and paneer."}
{"text":"If you don't like Indian food like me, you'll probably be not wanting to try this, but trust me, you should.  Before you go, make sure you're really thirsty because other wise you won't be motivated enough to get a soda from the soda machine. When I say soda machine, you're probably picturing the machines at KFC or McDonalds, but no. It's a touchscreen start with your favorite fruit screen. Then it gives you all of the fruits that it has and you pick your favorite. Finally, the screen lets you pick the soda that you want to come with it.  I ordered a chicken burrito and it was perfect! Not too spicy, juicy chicken, and really sweet cherry tomatoes and peppers. This is what I order every time now.  Lastly I want to talk to you about their hand-washing machine. You put your hands in and it senses them. It rinses your hands with soap and water and after twelve seconds, the wash is over. (By the way sorry if your like, heck, why's  this person talking about a hand washing machine? Just something I also enjoyed.)"}
{"text":"Very rarely do you see the words \"trendy\" and \"Indian food\" in the same sentence. Until Choolaah! Like the other reviewers that have preceded me have said, Choolaah definitely reminds you of a fancier Chipotle-Piada-meets-Indian-food with fresher ingredients. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful when it came time to ordering. The tandoors (ovens) are super cute. The layout of the restaurant with its open kitchen is just plain cool.   Came with the boo on a weekday night and pigged out, as per usual. For starters we tried the samosa chaat, which was surprisingly pretty good and close to being authentic! The chutneys (tamarind and cilantro) were great. I got the chicken plate with tikka masala sauce and naan. The sauce was delicious and perfect. The chicken was tender and tasty but the portion was rather small for the price. The naan was better than the frozen Trader Joes naan but not as good as the stuff you get at good Indian restaurants. Still, pretty satisfying. My partner in crime got the paneer (soft and delicious) with the chickpea masala sauce. The chickpea was the most disappointing dish of the night. But it might be because our mothers make delicious chickpea curry so we were overly critical. We ended up not eating too much of that. The choolaah fire sauce was also weird and tasted like Mexican hot sauce, not at all an appropriate accompaniment to the other food.   The mango lassi was divine, though. Made with alphonso mango pulp and done right.  Overall, Choolaah left me pretty impressed and I won't hesitate to come back. It's not terribly authentic, but that's not the point. It's a great introduction to Indian food if you aren't used to it or haven't tried it yet out of apprehension for all its spiciness. Highlights of the meal were the chicken tikka masala and mango lassi! Oh, and the  delightful hand washer, for obvious reasons."}
{"text":"I came for the opening. It was pretty crazy but they had it under control as much as possible.   The ordering process is easy. You can order online, in the restaurant, or get it delivered by Uber Eats, Grubhub, and another one that I can't remember. I personally ordered online because I didn't want to wait in the line. I was given a pickup time and it was ready. After you order online, you can go to the designated online pick up register and pick up your order.   I ordered the Perfect Balance Bowl with tofu. I chose the chickpea masala. I also got the naan and the mango lemonade. I also picked up the Tamarid Apple and Choolah Lava sauce. So delicious! The flavors were what I craved they would be. The naan is crispier than I normally have it but still delicious. The chickpea masala was flavorful and the chickpeas were cooked so that they weren't too crunchy or too soft. The tandoori veggies and a nice smoky flavor to them and the tofu was also smoky in flavor.  The mango lemonade was a refreshing spin on lemonade. There is also a mint lemonade as well, I do believe. My total came to just under $15, which is a bit pricey. But I would certainly go back."}
{"text":"I agree with most of these positive reviews. I also came to the grand opening 1-28-18. like any new and unusual place. It was wayyyy over crowded. VERY LOUD !!! But Delicious . The line was really long to get in , but the staff made you feel welcome. They even passed out new homemade types of lemonade to the customers in line. The parking in east Liberty really sucks , BUT THEY HAVE 45 MIN FREE PARKING in the back for the building. after that its only 3 bucks. Food was outstanding. Loved the Lamb meatballs. OHHH The Lava Sauce !!!! You place your order at the register and pay.They \"Page\" you when your order is ready , and you go pick it up and enjoy. They have a second floor for extra seating. I had to sit there because it was less noisy. You really should give this place a try. I'm sure you will see me there !"}
{"text":"Their lamb balls must have cocaine in them. I never had cocaine but I assume it eventually releases the same feeling I feel as I eat the lamb. I wish I had some free lamb balls right now!  God bless Choolaah Indian BBQ"}
{"text":"I wouldn't eat here again. This isn't really Indian food. It wasn't terrible tasting or anything, just not what I wanted. I got vegetable biryani, a side of naan, and extra raita and mint chutney.   There's zero spice. None. So that was strike one. The naan reminds me more of a soft saltine cracker than real naan. I barely got ANY raita, even after ordering extra and the raita I did get tasted like plain yogurt, not the delicious blend of yogurt, herbs, and flavor you normally get from a raita.   And to top it all off, I got my food delivered and they didn't pack any utensils which is my pet peeve. I stay in a hotel and don't have silverware, so without getting some with my food, I have to eat with my hands or go out and get some.   If you are unsure about Indian food and want to try a highly Americanized version, you could try this. I wouldn't get it, again, myself."}
{"text":"If you are looking for extremely Americanized Indian food this is for you. There is no spice to be had in any of the food. I feel that even though this is supposed to be Indian fast food it could have been way better executed. My food was cold even the naan bread which was supposed to be freshly made. I love Indian food and their food makes me sad. I will never return to this horrible restaurant."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and tasty fast food. Good atmosphere. It's also byob. Not very spicy but you can tailor your spice once you have ordered."}
{"text":"Basically the same idea as Chipotle, but with Indian food. I like the concept and think it is fun sorta fast food, but a little pricey for it being Chipotle level. You pick bowls or wraps and they come with sides. Nothing is spicy at all unless you add a spicy sauce purposefully. You sit where you want and there is a bar of sauces and utensils (again.. just like Chipotle!). It's very different from a more authentic or \"family owned\" type if Indian restaurant. The tastes aren't as rich and flavorful, but I do admit it is tasty anyway!   They have a selection of very interesting drinks. I definitely recommend trying one! I also give them major bonus points for being very vegetarian/vegan/gluten free friendly. They have 3 options for vegetarians like me. They had veggie balls (lentils I think?), tofu, and stir fried veggies. I haven't had a chance to try the tofu, so that is what I will get next time. Generally: I like it, I get what it is, I just wish it was a wee bit cheaper!"}
{"text":"So excited to finally try this place! It was busy on the first Wednesday they were open but the line went very quick. Plenty of seating both downstairs and upstairs. I ordered the Choolaah bowl with veggies and lentils with half rice and half greens.  I think I waited all of 2 minutes before the food was ready. I got some of the mint yogurt sauce (from their choice of about 5 on a DIY bar). The serving was plenty and everything was so delicious! Very fresh and all of the flavors together were very nice, especially with the mint yogurt. My friend was equally happy with her chicken bowl.  Can't wait to come back! FYI, it's also BYOB!"}
{"text":"What a great find. Modern building with very good Indian cuisine. If not sure what you ordering get the picture menu."}
{"text":"Wonderful, trendy atmosphere and delicious, fresh food. I am not embarrassed to admit that I licked my bowl clean."}
{"text":"Not authentic Indian food but okay for fast food. I got the lamb balance bowl. The veggies were great but the tikka Masala and the lamb meatballs lacked flavor. This is also coming from an Indian background so I know I have expected standards. However, they do have many variety of sauces that have flavor."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 5 times now, and have always had a stellar experience!  Food - 5/5 - I've had authentic Indian cuisine in India.  This is not authentic, but definately brings in the flavors of India, with a familiar \"American\" feel.  The Naan and Paneer are stellar.  Atmosphere - 5/5 - The designers really paid attention to the details.  From the glass-wall see-through kithen, to the tile work and toe-open bathroom door, and the cool hand-sanitizing machine - it's all really well done!  Staff - 5/5 - Everyone at ChooLaah has been really polite and helpful thus far!"}
{"text":"I tried this place over the weekend because I had student who brought their food into the office and it smelled so good!!!!! The cashier was extremely nice and really helpful when I told her it was my first time there. She went over the menu with me and all the options I could order as a meal. I had the tofu and veggies with the chickpea masala and of course samosa! You can tell this was a very Americanized version of Indian food but it was still good!!!! Even my parents who have never had Indian food enjoyed it. The portions are great! I had leftovers for lunch the next day. And the flavors were everything that I wanted! I think next time I want to have the dine in experience. Oh and the service was quick, which I truly appreciated!"}
{"text":"Sooo so good!  I've eaten Indian food all over and this is by far the best around.  Better than any white tablecloth places in the area by far.  It's like I've had blinders taken off of my taste buds.  Incredible food, right from actual tandoor ovens.  Check my reviews and you'll see I reserve 5 stars for truly exceptional places like Choolah.    They do everything right.  Super fast and friendly service in a clean and unique dining room.  The food comes in less than 5 minutes, so it's actually fast food, but made to order and fresh at the same price as a burrito.  The meats are seared to perfection, with great seasonings.  The mint chutney is so fresh and vibrant, it goes great with their fresh samosas.  You can't go wrong, just pick anything and it will be fresh and delicious.  Try out their cool hand washer too.  Like everything else they do, it's fast, efficient, modern, clean and will leave you wondering why everyplace isn't as simple and effective as Choolah."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is open and welcoming.  The food choices are varied but also very fresh.  The service was quick and the food was delicious and authentic."}
{"text":"When I moved up to Cleveland, I faced a significant challenge: I had to find a new \"go-to\" restaurant.  Something relatively cheap, quick, and consistently delicious.  Boy, did I hit the jackpot with Choolaah.  An \"Indian BBQ\" restaurant, Choolaah serves up authentic, tasty food, and A LOT of it.  There's always plenty of seating here, so my party of 6 grabbed a table right away.  We ordered 2 Chicken BBQ Plates, one Salmon BBQ plate, one Chicken Tikka Masala bowl, one Chicken Biryani bowl, some Paneer cheese, and dessert.  The Chicken Biryani bowl is by far the best dish on the menu.  The blend of curry and other spices are incredible.  Topped off with a crispy naan crust, you can't beat it.  The Paneer Cheese is great as a side dish, but careful, it's got a bit of a kick to it.  Any of the Tikka Masala bowls are wonderful as well, providing a unique, traditional, and authentic Indian taste.  For dessert, be sure to grab a chocolate truffle and Malai Kulfi ice cream!  The futuristic layout and incredible food makes you forget that the outside of the building says \"Indian BBQ\".  This place is the real deal, and should be on any foodie's hit list in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food tastes soooo good that it's almost unbelievable. Everything is fresh and the service is top-notch. The only complaint I have about this place is that it can be hard to turn left out of their driveway onto Chagrin... but that's hardly their fault!"}
{"text":"My kids go to college in Cleveland and have already eaten at this restaurant there and love it. I finally got to go yesterday. My brother and I ordered the \"perfect balance\" lamb with the black masala and chicken with the yellow masala. We really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere.   I also ordered the Samosa which I would not order again.  It tasted OK however the crust was more like a pastry and thicker then what I'm used to.  For my liking the filling to crust ratio was too low."}
{"text":"By far the best Indian food in Cleveland  Limited options but well done on taste n spice  Their Briyani ana Naans are like the same as back My new fav with them is Malai kulfi I so wish they were also on west side .... Very neat n clean  Great parking   Just awesome"}
{"text":"What a wonderful fast casual restaurant. The flavors are outstanding and the portions are great. I definitely recommend trying this place out.   One thing i would love to see is a BBQ combo. I like to try a little bit of everything."}
{"text":"I'm from California and every time I come for training here in Cleveland  I come here at least a few times. I love the tikka masala sauce on anything!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype! Believe this hype because there is no exaggeration here but all of the food that this place serves is really that good! I came here with my coworkers and we all ordered something different and were craving more! Initially I purchased the Chaat Somosa because those are my two favorite items so when I seen that they had it put together I was very curious! At first I was hesitant since I myself am Indian and am use to the real Indian food, I find most places slack off on spices but this place is the REAL deal! That Chaat Somosa was the best I've ever had. It reminded me of the actual street food that I would have in India! Must go back here again!  Only thing I didn't like is that they charge $1 for Chutney which is realistically unreasonable when someone orders an item they should atleast be able to get chutney with it covered in the cost. Besides that, this place is awesome! Also, for you guys wondering the lamb meatballs are the only thing halal on the menu, I haven't tried them but those are next on my list!"}
{"text":"Went here recently with my sisters. This was my very first time here. The interior is very sleek and modern. Plenty of space inside to eat. The food is great here. I ordered the Tikka Masala with chicken. Very yummy especially with the Naan and Basmati rice. This place is very unique, which is what I love about it. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"We, a group of 14, came in today for lunch. This is the place we will come when we come to Cleveland Ohio. This India BBQ restaurant is very casual and relaxing dining. You put your order and pay first, then you find your own seatings. There are many tables and chairs.  The open kitchen is very cool, you can see how they make bread and prepare the meals. I always order chicken marsala BBQ meal, it comes with bread and soup. The lamb meatballs are also delicious too. Mango drink is very tasty and unique. I can come here again and again...  Atmosphere: 4 out of 5 Décor: 3 out of 5 Cleanliness: 3 out of 5 Food: 4 out of 5 Presentation 4 out of 5 Taste 4 out of 5"}
{"text":"All the reviews are right on. It's not as oily as regular Indian food, and it's very filling. Priced well, good service, and  fun atmosphere. I'm excited to go back!"}
{"text":"When I heard the ovens have Steelers names on them, I knew this was the perfect place for that apology dinner for that friend whose sports enthusiasm I may have mocked (maybe more than once).   Most delicious and painless apology ever. Why say I'm sorry with flowers when you can say it with TIKI MASSALA?!   Upscale environs, down to earth prices. Bring your kids (or someone else's) so you can try the Naan Chicken Pizza without embarrassing yourself by asking to order off the kids menu.   Great for a mixed palates and needs (vegetarian, gluten-free, spicy and NOT-spicy)."}
{"text":"Choolaah is a fantastic addition to East Liberty.   The food is delicious and the atmosphere is great. You're paying for quality ingredients and fresh food. I've had the lamb, salmon, and chicken and all were fantastically cooked and had tons of flavor. Their sauce bar is also great. Lots to choose from! The freshly made drinks pair great with the food.   They offer free 45 minute parking in the lot by their restaurant. There's paid street parking nearby if you need more time.   We also ordered catering from Choolaah and people loved the food. There was a slight timing mixup but they quickly fixed it when contacted!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! I am originally from Chicago and am relatively new to Cleveland, so I find myself missing home-cooking Indian food quite often. While the food here isn't quite what I would make at home, the ingredients are fresh and I feel like I am eating high-quality Indian comfort food! I am vegetarian and I think the quality of the paneer, in particular, is stellar. The channa masala is perfectly seasoned which I think is very rare for an Indian restaurant. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for a filling, healthy, and quality Indian meal!!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Perfect for vegans too. I ordered the chickpea (Chana) masala bowl, on brown rice, with veggie croquettes. So delicious! They have diced jalapeños and a fire hot sauce at their counter that you can put on top as well.  The interior is spacious and modern. They had a huge table that was perfect for our large group. The table had books inside of it too which was pretty cool.  They also have a hand washing station that is \"like a jacuzzi for you hands\"... very cool!  It's one of the best fast causal places. Even if you aren't into Indian food this is a great place to start. I hope they open more locations! Pittsburgh and Columbus could def use a place like this."}
{"text":"LOVE Choolaah. First had it in Cleveland and was so happy when they opened in Pittsburgh. Lots of vegan options. I always do the somosas (AMAZING) and the chickpea masala bowl. Their naan is great as well. They are always super busy so recommend ordering online if you want take out. Great fast casual food!"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed when I made it to this place with my wife. Perhaps it was just overhyped. The place was nice looking. It's obvious that a lot of thought went into it. I know the food has been toned down but I found it a little bland. I think they went a bit too far to cater to the American palate."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I became an instant fan. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala bowl and it was delish. The nan bread that is made fresh there is incredible. The restaurant itself is wood and metal and very chic. LOVE THIS PLACE!!"}
{"text":"What do you expect from an Indian restaurant ?? Heavy menu !!! Same curry base !!! Lots of spices food !!! All Indians in the restaurant !!! Guess what if you think all of these you will be complete wrong and awestruck with this place, contemporary Indian restaurant with an American twist of decor  1. No words 2. Absolutely brilliant concept 3. Awesome decor 4. Mind blowing people 5. Simple Menu 6. Mouth watering food 7. Holy S**t everything is good here 8. Special mention to eeny, meeny, miny, moe -- want to know more about this ?? you have to visit the restaurant   Happy smiles around , Aromatic spices, Well balanced flavors , I don't know what to say about I am lost of words   Guess what I am a michigander but I am happy to travel three hours once in a while to eat here...   Kudos to the owner of this place for coming up with this amazing restaurant  Only one thing I was worried about is if you go in lunch time prepare yourself to wait at the counter but not for your food.  Will I come back ?? : I returned on the same day after one hour ... you know what I'm speaking but with four other friends this time  Value for money : 200%  Service : perfect"}
{"text":"I have been hunting all around Ohio for Indian food this delicious!! The chicken tikka masala is so amazing! The chicken was seasoned and cooked perfectly and the sauce was so flavorful I couldn't get enough. I have no doubt I will be craving CHOOLAAH! I can't believe they only have one location so far! I want one in every city! :)"}
{"text":"I am in love! Like chipotle for Indian food. The food is fresh and very tasty! Wonderful flavors and unique drinks, sauces etc. Very modern ambiance and decor. I could eat here every day."}
{"text":"Awesome. Great food. Something different. Love the chicken tiki masala"}
{"text":"I loved my entire experience at choolah. The cashier was so helpful in showing us the menu and even let us taste all of the Marsala sauces as well as the lemonades. I tried a bowl with veggie croquettes with naan. I also had a order of samosas. Everything I tried I loved, the spicy mango sauce really made the bowl stand out! I would recommend this place to all of my friends. Also having a free parking garage (for 45 min max) was very helpful and made it easier than trying to park on the street."}
{"text":"Tasty and affordable Indian food! I went here with friends who described this place as chipotle for Indian food, which seemed accurate. The place is minimalistic, but light and airy. The food is cooked behind large glass windows, and comes out fairly quickly. My one dislike was that the mango Lassi portions were tiny: 3.95 for a child - sized cup! Otherwise, the flavors were great and it's a good option for affordable Indian food in the area. Vegan and Vegetarian options also available."}
{"text":"I literally can go here every single day. They have the best Indian food! Total comfort food and in love with this place."}
{"text":"I really love everything about this place. The location, decor, and food are amazing.  Be sure to try the samosas! They are wonderful. The entire menu is good. The naan is baked fresh in tandoori ovens. You can watch them being baked as the kitchen is visible (behind a glass viewing wall).   Overall, it's a great choice for a fast yet good Indian meal."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Friendly, quick service. Really good, reasonably priced food. And the restaurant itself is really cool. Been there nearly ten times over the past couple of months - it's possible that I'm developing a problem here."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Guy at the counter was so helpful in answering all questions and making sure we got the most out of our visit.  Place was very clean and the food was so good!! You will wash your hands just to try the hand Jacuzzi!  The even have reserved parking spots closest to the door for veterans and active service members. You can see them making the naan and chicken in the tandoors while you eat."}
{"text":"I like the paneer, tikka masala and kulfi here. The rest are meh.  Paneer: indian cheese, made by Amish source.  Tikka masala sauce: the most flavorful sauce here  Kulfi: I had mango flavor. The taste reminds me of  mango lasse. It is a type of frozen custard. I'm hesitant to call it ice cream because it is not whipped, so it's less airy, more dense and creamier."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and excellent concept. My wife and I visited this place today and couldn't be happier with our decision. The dishes are tasty, restaurant is inviting and service is impeccable. This will be the go to place for an excellent meal! Well done Choolaah!"}
{"text":"So good! And the service was awesome. It was our first time there and the cashier explained the entire menu, made spot on recommendations, and was genuinely friendly. My S.O. ordered the lamb meatballs with rice and chickpeas on the side. I ordered the chicken tikka masala and we both got naan, wheat naan, samosas, and samosa chaat. The food was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Choolaahs. When I am in the area I stop by and have Tikka Masala with chicken and a wheat naan.This place is wonderful!   The service is excellent and you get your food very quickly even when they are busy.   They also have a small selection of beer but some great choices. For dessert they have chocolate truffles and Mango Kulfi.    I could eat here every day."}
{"text":"I've had Choolaah only once before but when I was tasked with catering a work lunch for a small group who had 4 different diets to follow (including vegan, vegetarian to name a few), I thought Choolaah would be the perfect solution. Ordering proved to be a little tricky, as you have to leave a message for the catering manager to call back so you can't place an order as soon as you call- and keep in mind orders have to be placed at least 24 hrs in advance.  I ordered the salad with paneer on the side (vegan friendly), BBQ chicken with chickpea masala, rice, a side of vegetables, and a side of potatoes. It was perfect for a group of 10 (although no leftovers). The fire sauce was quite hot but good; the spicy mango tasted like mango puree with a good kick, and the tamarind ginger was a good salad dressing. The flavor of everything was really yummy, lots of spices but not strong- and if you think you don't like Indian this is the perfect place to try it, as the flavors and spices aren't in your face. I especially enjoyed all the extras on the salad (chickpeas, pickled onions, yellow raisins among the other fresh veggies)- the lamb meatballs were delish and not greasy at all, and the chicken had great flavor.   Everything was fresh, everybody was very happy with their lunch, and the food was great. If only they provided delivery, I would cater much more often!"}
{"text":"My son nailed it, Choolaah is to Indian as Chipotle is to Mexican, a sad cartoonish imitation of the real thing. We had great trepidation as we approached the glass and stainless edifice, but on looking around found that it was filled with South Asian people, so figured what the heck, they probably know better than us.    The naan, though seemingly made fresh and right in front of us still had the consistency of cardboard, without the crusty backside and pillowy soft interior one hopes for; it was more like a cracker, without the big bubbles a hot tandoor should produce.   The BBQ chicken was OK, as long as you weren't expecting something like Tandoori chicken. Like the sauces provided it was just bland and uninteresting.   To top it off, the meal was not cheap; nearly $30 for two of us. The only saving grace was that they offered several varieties of interesting bottled beer.   It probably really deserves two stars, its not as though the food was nasty or disgusting, just boring."}
{"text":"After seeing some great reviews here on yelp and mostly for I love the idea of making food on chulah, I decided to give it a try. I drove down all the way from westside just to try their food. I ordered online for takeout, which I must say was very convenient (not a very common feature for local restaurants). Going by the reviews, I was really excited to eat their lamb meatballs; however I was disappointed a bit. The meatballs tasted good but it was kinda medium done. I don't like ground meats unless its well done. I'd have appreciated if that was mentioned somewhere in the menu. As, apparently, from an Indian restaurant I'd expect meats to be well done unless otherwise stated. If I revisit the restaurant, I'd surely ask if they could make the lamb meatballs well done. I have a strong feeling I'd love it then if they cud, but just not now. Rest of the food including Chipotle like style of bowl system was okay. I liked the chicken bbq (better than the lamb meatballs).  Nice and clean restaurant, and plenty of parking spaces."}
{"text":"Officially my favorite new place, I've gone 5 times this year already. Extremely friendly workers, fast service, delicious & flavorful food, and they even gave threw in two chocolate truffles when I filled out a survey on my receipt. I'd recommend any combination of lamb meatballs and tikka masala. Soooooo good!"}
{"text":"Well done ..Very well done ..I will eagerly wait for it to open a store near me ... No complaints whatsoever ... The food has all the flavors of a typical home cooked meal and the ease of fast food .The service is really really good . Trenaije explained everything to us really really well and there was a ease to her explanation ..We even got to samples some of the masala before we decided on what we waited...Only sometimes do u meet such good cashier and for that thank you ..I hope they know they have a good employee in her...So coming to the food  ... U will definitely fall in loove and the inside is even wonderful .The tandoori chicken is warm and spot on . They even have a hand washing station for your convenience . So go on enjoy ..."}
{"text":"So excited to finally try this place! Yum! I highly recommend the mango lassi, chicken tikka masala, samosa chaat, and Malai Kulfi. The biryani wasn't my favorite but they did just open yesterday so I will give it a try again later. The decor of this place is impressive as is their marketing concept. We will be back, often I hope! A breath of fresh air for Cleveland."}
{"text":"Everything was great! Those who think it's overpriced, I really think your paying for quality ingredients, inventive chefs, quick service, and location. That was okay by me. We spent just under $40 and got a ton of food- a tofu salad, the lamb meatball/rice/masala bowl, samosas, roasted veggie side, and two mango lassis for a toddler and two adults. We'll definitely be back! (You can park in the garage if your under 45 minutes- we were over and total was $3). It's BYOB! I forgot my wine but next time, definitely.  Wait for food was really short, service was friendly. Very clean."}
{"text":"This place has a fun vibe. The workers were very helpful and friendly. I however did not love their chicken. It was gritty and chewy. But the rice and curry sauce was great!"}
{"text":"Loved the food. Loved the restaurant. Very cool. And I've never rated an Indian restaurant 5 stars before.   I've never been a fan of Indian food despite generally liking spicy food. Wife and kids like Indian. And kids like Chipotle. So we decided to try it out. I like how they converted a car dealership. Modern and clean. We ordered chicken plate, lamb meatball plate, masala, meatball sandwich and lettuce wrap.  All were great. It's probably not the most authentic place, but there were about a third of the customers who looked like they should know.  For someone who is not that fond of authentic Indian, this place hit the right balance. From my point of view, I liked that most of the items were not curry dishes."}
{"text":"I decided to give Choolaah a try, as I was wanting something new and I'm not too familiar with Indian cuisine.  Unfortunately I don't think it's for me, but I was impressed by Choolaah's atmosphere! The modern architecture is very visually appealing and the restaurant contains pieces that I've never seen before: a decorative table made out of books and a jacuzzi-like hand washing station, to be exact.  The ordering process appeared confusing but my cashier was very friendly and helpful! Overall, Choolaah appears to be a trendy, go-to spot for those who enjoy Indian food and I can see why."}
{"text":"New fav place to eat. Their food is so wonderful! They let you try all the different masalas sauces, special drinks they make daily. Trying new food can be a bit much for some people, so getting to try before you buy is PERFECT! Free parking, quick cook time, great location. #winning You can even watch them cook your food, I find that awesome."}
{"text":"Indian food without soul.   Chicken tastes like fajitas from Chili's... menu organized to maximize profit, ordering system is janky, food served quickly without flavor.  Tikka tastes and smells like tomato soup.  Paneer is not made in house and tastes like farmers cheese not made fresh daily.  Naan is nothing like naan."}
{"text":"It seems like the concept of Choolah has been pretty well covered in other reviews here -- it's the Chipotle of Indian food. We all know that by now, right? So on to the more important topic -- how is the food? I recently tried their veggie croquette tikka masala, samosas, and garlic naan (all take out). It was a bit of a mixed bag. First thing to note is that this isn't really authentic Indian food. I mean, they try, but the flavors are very muted compared to what you would get at a real-deal Indian restaurant. For example, the tikka masala didn't have the spice or warmth of traditional tikka masala...it was pretty bland, with the dominant flavor being almost tomato-soup-like. There are sauces available that you can use to doctor up your food (which help), but I think the masala itself could use a kick in the flavor pants. However, the veggie croquettes were pretty tasty. They're obviously different from the veggie balls that you'd get in, say, malai kofta, but they were delicious and an interesting departure from typical Indian fare. I also enjoyed the samosas...unlike the masala, these actually did have some spice and flavor. As for the naan, it was a letdown. I love naan that's fluffy, soft, and chewy, but this naan was thin and tough...maybe even a bit stale.   Choolah uses high quality ingredients (hooray for antibiotic-free chicken!), and the food isn't bad for what it is. If you're looking for a fast meal and a unique take on Indian food, this will get the job done. However, if given the choice, I'd probably head to an authentic Indian place over Choolah every time."}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but really enjoyed the experience.   I like the menu's range. I'm not super versed in Indian food, so the cashier helped me pick out something, which was nice.  We got our food quickly and were able to get a table on the second floor. The atmosphere is modern, airy and millennial-friendly."}
{"text":"Really good! We lived in DC for 5 years where there is an abundance of good Indian restaurants and was scared that we wouldn't be able to get quality Indian here in Cleveland. Went here on a whim, and was pleasantly surprised! The food is good, fast, and fresh!"}
{"text":"I love that more and more restaurants utilize delivery services! Choolaah is fresh and tasty and their different sauces are really good! I ordered chicken tikka  with brown rice and naan. The chicken was really flavorful and solid quality. The masala sauce wasn't the boldest but i really liked the addition of other sauces! I added a lot of the lava hot sauce and the mint yogurt sauce!  I thought the naan was good too but i do wish they did offer more than plain naan. Garlic naan is always better! When it comes down to it, Choolah offers tasty food at a very affordable price! I think I'll definitely put it in my general rotation."}
{"text":"Good Indian option. I personally love their BBQ Chicken Bowl.  They bring a good balance of fast casual and Indian flavors. Basically chipotle of Indian food.  Don't expect great Indian food it's Americanized to suit a wider pallet but it's good food.  Can't go wrong with it."}
{"text":"This is a very nice indian food place! The fact that it looks luxury is a really nice thing and makes it more comfortable. They have many options for everyone's taste and meal type. The food is seasoned very well. My only critic is with the samosa, to me it could have been wayy better cause it really didn't taste like anything. I got a beer also and 4.99 price tag is kinda high. But if your in the mood for indian food, you should totally check out this place!"}
{"text":"Updating my review since I come here almost weekly now. Still wishing they gave you more rice, but problem easily solved by ordering an extra side, the rice is to die for anyway. You get a survey coupon for a free truffle every time. Definitely get extra rice to help soak up the tikka masala, you get a very generous portion! I can only speak for the meat free options. Vegetarians: the paneer is divine, vegans: the veggie croquettes are huge. If you're not a heavy eater, you could easily make two meals out of this, but I finish the whole thing. Yum! Staff is great, space is clean and the wait time is usually no more than 5-7 minutes, if that."}
{"text":"If you're craving Indian food and in a rush...Choolaah will do the trick.  Choolaah reminds me of a fast-casual Chipotle, but with Indian food. You order at one counter and pick it up at another counter when they call your name. There's plenty of places to sit throughout-- as I think it was actually a former car dealership. Huge space!  I'm not sure if it was the best Indian food I've ever had, but it was still pretty tasty. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I find the atmosphere a tad stressful. When it's busy, it's BUSY, and people tend to build up everywhere and it creates a somewhat chaotic environment.  Regardless, I'm just an addict to their Chicken Tikka Masala, so I'll certainly be back. It's also super budget friendly, so happy dance for your wallet! You can get a healthy, pretty generous lunch for $10ish. They also have an online ordering platform coming soon, which should help those of us who prefer to grab and go!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! Great menu, wonderful prices, friendly staff (and helpful with the menu) and a unique atmosphere! Make sure you wash your hands near the soda dispenser!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I loved it! The concept is really cool. The girl behind the counter took the time to explain the menu and to give suggestions.   I ordered the chickpea masala bowl with white rice and wheat naan. Delicious!! My food was very filling and I enjoyed every bite of it. If I am ever in the area again, I will definitely consider eating there."}
{"text":"Tikki masala was very flavorful. I had it with lamb and brown rice and veggies. One bowl was two meals for me. I also had the paneer wrap which was decent. Naan was good. I loved the sauces that you get to try. I would like to come back again and try something new."}
{"text":"Excellent food and fast service. I had the  BBQ chicken with Naan and Black Lentil Daal and it was delicious. The spicy mango sauce was amazing! Service was also very good and I appreciated the order taker walking me through the menu before ordering. This was only my second time eating Indian food and I absolutely loved it! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The Tikka Masala in the protein bowl was amazing. This is a very modern restaurant. The creativity is so out of the box. I enjoyed this a lot  We got the food very quickly. Also, the fact that we can see the food being cooked is also amazing. There was probably a lot of thought that went into this. The moment I walked in I was amazed. My daughter loves the swing right in the front."}
{"text":"This is the future of Pakistani/Indian food in America. They are truly on to something with their model & I have a feeling we will see Choolah franchises all over the US in the next 10 years. The smartest thing is bringing the kitchen in full view which allows people to see how it's being prepared. The bright lighting & 'chipotle style' serving style helps people unfamiliar with South East Asian cuisine, the chance to see it before they eat it, outside of the typical murky Indian food buffets. The future is here."}
{"text":"I was searching for Indian food in the area through Yelp, and I happened on to this place that is about 15 minutes from me. The food tastes like a slightly less greasy version of the Indian food I'm used to at the restaurants around here. The naan and the mango ice cream are the highlights here. The naan is very fresh and has the perfect texture. The mango ice cream is very tangy but not overpoweringly sweet. The hand jacuzzi is also a nice touch. Great Chipotle-esque style restaurant with significantly higher quality food, and a very unique spin on Indian food."}
{"text":"Very surprised by this place.  It really is a quick service (think chipotle) version of indian food.  The chicken is great - Tikka Masala sauce is good, but a little under spiced - probably because they are shooting to appeal to the masses.  The naan is reasonable, the piece I got a was a little cold - but it wasn't bad.  I bet a fresh piece is really really good.  The chickpeas were also very good.  I am impressed and will be back.  The location is reasonable, and the building is clean and modern."}
{"text":"Can you say Indian pita? Yeah? Well that's pretty much what it is and its well seasoned. Something different from the mundane quick lunch."}
{"text":"Chipotle style service meets the great spices of India.  We love this place.  The food is good, the price is right, and the staff is so much more accommodating than most fast food places.  I hate to use that category since it is a bit classier than what I normally define as fast food.  We have been here at least 6 times and tried something different each time.  It has always been consistently good and tasty."}
{"text":"Choolah:  ('choo-lah) Adjective   1     Incredibly brilliant.   2     Incredibly brilliant Indian restaurant.   3     Brilliantly incredible.   Need I say more? This place is incredibly brilliant.   If it was a chain, it would inevitably be compared to Chipotle. But it's not a chain. Let's compare it to Chipotle anyway. If it Was to go corporate, it would no doubt spread to all corners of the earth and become successful on that same level. It's got the same walk up, stand in line and order type system as Chipotle. And then you order not just a good burrito but amazing Indian food. And apparently pretty authentic Indian food too, because there were quite a few Indians in there. I don't usually see Mexicans flocking to Chipotle. I did the Chicken Tikka Masala bowl. That included lots of Chicken Tikka Masala, a generous helping of rice, a large, ahem, Chipotle tortilla sized piece of naan and a mysterious cup of spicy mango sauce. Oh was I good; it was even amazing; it was even some of the better food I've had, and I wasn't even very hungry. Plus they were giving out free cups of mango mousse! Chipotle doesn't have desert.   Choolah has a lot of the same vibes as the other C-restaurant, (I'm sick of saying Ch****le in this review) but it's quite obvious that a lot more thought was put into it. They have many cool touches, like a glass encased kitchen where you are able to gaze upon the umm, the kitchen. A hand jacuzzi for uhh, your hands, to clean them. A giant wooden table with up-turned books fit all down the middle. Choolah is obviously far to cool to go chain and compete with the likes of Ch****le.   In other words, I was very impressed."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch with a coworker on a busy pre-holiday weekday. After 10 light cycles (no exaggeration) getting off 271S, we were able to make our way towards Choolaah. I was dying of hunger after waiting in traffic for so long, and I was happy to see that the long line to order was moving quickly. Although compared to Chipotle, here you order and are given a buzzer that lights up once your food is ready. This helps to prevent a log jam at the counter.  Things I loved: - How items are clearly labeled as vegan, vegetarian, etc.  - Quick service - nearly as soon as I ordered, by buzzer went off and I was able to get my food - The food was very solid - I had samosas and the chick pea masala - The hand washing machine was kind of a neat feature  Things that could be better: - The person taking my order wasn't aware of what's vegan or not - it was a little hard to distinguish between the dark green vegetarian dot label on the menu and the light green vegan dot on the menu, and when I asked about an item, the person ringing me out wasn't sure.  - The well meaning manager (I think?) asked us how things were going nearly as soon as we sat down with our food. I told him we hadn't even had a chance to try everything, and he proceeded to ask me how to improve things. I appreciate that he wanted my feedback, but... - The location. Getting to anything on Chagrin is as painful as jabbing a needle in your eye because of the ever present traffic. Thankfully service was fast, otherwise lunch would have turned into a really long lunch.  Overall, I think this is a great new fast casual concept and I hope to see them succeed. I especially hope they can open other locations in less grid-locked areas."}
{"text":"Great Indian take-away!  We had the chicken roasted vegetables bowl- very good!  Lamb meatballs- very good... but you will be reminded of them for the next few hours:).  Apps were ok.  Lots of sauces from which to choose.  Drinks are excellent.  I suggest ordering online to avoid the line. (But there is free short term parking in the lot underneath)"}
{"text":"Such an awesome place !!!! Starting from the food to the hand wash contraption to the  magnetic wall by the restrooms, this place was just awesome. We got the vegetable biryani, chicken biryani and the paneer tikka bowl with rice. The food was awesome! It isn't authentic Indian food but much better than most Indian restaurants we have been to. They said they had started adding raisins to their biryani recently and I liked it but my husband wasn't a big fan. That didn't stop him from eating his biryani though :P Our almost 1 year old baby boy was with us and a member of their staff stopped by our table to say hello to us and chatted with us for a bit. She also brought back some malai kulfi and cinnamon cookie for us to try which was very nice of her !! We also tried the mango kulfi and the chocolate truffle which were amazing as well.  Overall, the food was great and the service was awesome and I can't wait to go back there !"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! Chicken, black lentil curry and Mango lassi are favorite."}
{"text":"Love Choolah! I've come here about a dozen times since they opened in November and each experience is great! It's a Indian fast causal restaurant with a great atmosphere and amazing food. I've tried pretty much everything on the menu and they have a ton of variety for everyone. My favorite is the chicken bbq plate, but I also love the chicken biryani. Very easy and fast with super helpful and friendly workers. The restaurant itself is very spacious with lots of seating and modern decor."}
{"text":"I have a feeling that most of the meat and vegetables and curries are frozen , cooked at different location and shipped to this location and just heated up here and served. Things like naan( thin n tasteless) , rice, paav are made here. Wooden furniture is not comfortable at all. Too loud music.ginger lemonade was something new and refreshing. The onions kept on chutney bar should be sliced and not chopped . All in all I may not come again to a high priced low portion frozen food and uncomfortable place.$12 for 3 balls of lamb ..,8 table spoons of rice .,, 2 scoops of tikka masala is too much"}
{"text":"I'm not gonna pretend to be an expert on Indian food, but this place makes really great food. Great Chicken Tikka Masala in a really modern establishment."}
{"text":"The inside of this restaurant is hip and bright, with lots of plate glass, colorful hand-painted artwork on white walls, and an enormous chalkboard wall with magnet words on it access from the restrooms downstairs. (There are more single-occupancy, gendered restrooms upstairs.) You order downstairs and then pick up the food when your buzzer goes off.   The menu is varied, with rice bowls, salads, wraps, sides, drinks, and desserts. The chicken tiki masala bowl was tasty even without an added sauce, and a respectable portion to boot. Look out: the lamb meatball wrap was surprisingly spicy (not in a bad way, just...in a surprising way). The samosas are small but delectable, and you could totally order the samosa chaat with the mango laasi for a small meal. The vegetarian sloppy joe was? reportedly good, on something like a potato roll. The biriyani was disappointing, however. While the crust was crunchy like a large, impossibly thin chip (I ate the whole thing), the inside was not particularly moist. Our table also agreed that the naan was a disappointment, having the taste and texture of pizza crust.   Nevertheless, we are likely to come back when we want a quick meal (this time we were not quick enough to qualify for free parking behind the restaurant; after 45 minutes it's $3). I still want to try their desserts--good luck having any room after all the good food you'll want to eat!"}
{"text":"Awful food in an unfriendly environment.  If you like Indian food there are several places having better food at lower prices."}
{"text":"We ordered pick up from Choolah, mostly to support the Black Urban Gardeners Society, so it was our first time trying them out.  I wish that we could write a better review, but sadly, they forgot a bunch of menu items that we ordered, so I didn't get to try some of the appetizers and drinks.  What we did get to eat was good, but we were charged for all this food and didn't even get to enjoy it.  It was really random: each entree that we ordered was missing something and they didn't put our drinks for the kids in the bag.  I called them to complain, but it was nearly impossible to actually get a human being on the phone to talk to.  When I finally did talk to a manager, they were really apologetic and nice...they offered to send us a gift card, took our address and name and said that they would send it in the mail.  We were ecstatic!   Weeks went by... no gift card... so I guess they just led us on? I don't think we'll order from them again."}
{"text":"Delicious little Indian joint. If you're looking for what is has been called the \"Chipotle of Indian food\", this is it! It's a bit better because, you know, Indian food. Not like I'm biased or anything.   Very clean, huge, trendy modern architecture and interior decor. Sort of a Noodles-and-company-style menu, but better.  Ordered two Perfect Balance Bowls with chicken and lamb respectively, which contained tandoori and chickpea masala. Took only minutes (10 or less) and we could have as much sauce (tamarind, spicy mango, etc) as we wanted. The raita (yogurt) was extra, annoyingly enough. Anyone who eats Indian regularly knows you need to have your raita with every meal.   Taste-wise? Not too bad, but the vegetables were slightly hard, and the naan that we added to our meals wasn't that hot. It actually was barely lukewarm. The lamb kebabs were delightfully flavorful, slightly tangy.   Overall, a fairly authentic taste experience mixed with the convenience of fast food. Will be back again to get a better look at everything!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the portion size of the paneer tikka masala bowl, my added side of naan was delicious but more than I needed. The staff was friendly and the service was quick. The space was incredibly modern and clean. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and really helpful employees. I am not an expert with Indian food, but I thought theirs was tasty. Especially for a counter service restaurant."}
{"text":"This is Indian food the way Chipotle is Mexican food. An approximation, an assembly line, if you're in the mood for quick food that tastes decent. The flavour is good. Tried some choolaah bowls (lamb bbq and veggie croquettes). The paneer was fresh. I'd definitely go here rather than a typical Indian restaurant in America (which usually serves dishes I can make better)."}
{"text":"For what it is - Indian-inspired fast casual - Choolaah was delicious. I absolutely love Indian food, especially any nice rich, thick, spicy curry dish, but of course wouldn't expect that here since that takes time to make.  Bf got the lamb meatballs choolaah bowl and I got the salmon choolaah bowl, each with rice + greens, tikka masala sauce, and naan. The portions were reasonable for the price and quality (comparable to Panera, Chipotle, etc). The meats were tasty. The tikka masala isn't like the creamy, thick sauce you'd get at an Indian restaurant, but is more like a tomato sauce flavored with Indian spices. Still delicious. The naan had garlic, onion, and salt on it and was soft and chewy - yum.  We also got a side of samosas each. These weren't bad - the potato-pea filling was very ordinary and didn't have much going on in the spice department. The filling to dough ratio was definitely dough heavy also. But for \"fast food\" samosas, it's what I would've expected.  For condiments, we tried the mint chutney, mango, and regular hot sauce.  They were all pretty tasty.  We ordered online for pick up - it was a pretty smooth process. Cost for two people to be fairly full + tax came out to about $33. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is simply awesome. It's a modern healthy unique dining experience. I love the Jacuzzi to wash your hands. They had quick service and the food was delicious. I highly recommend the chicken tikka masala, the Samosa chaat, lentil soup lettuce wraps and really just everything there.  Check out the word magnets by the restroom walls and the pop machine was fun for the kids. This is an upscale yet cost-effective eating option and I would not hesitate to go there again and again ands get j"}
{"text":"I love Indian food and even though this is somewhat of a \"fast food\" version, the quality is not sacrificed! My entire experience was fantastic. This is a very popular spot, the line was long but went quickly. I was so impressed with the level of customer service, when you go to order they let you sample any and all masalas and even their specialty drinks. They don't rush you to choose, and offer suggestions on what to get. We ordered and you're given an alarm pad like Panera bread, we chose a seat and took a sample of each of the sauces while we waited. The mint yogurt is my favorite! Our food didn't take long and was amazing! I got a perfect balance bowl with chicken and my boyfriend got the lamb meatballs. We loved our visit and will certainly be going back! It's amazing and awful that it's within walking distance of my house, they will be getting a large portion or my paychecks!"}
{"text":"Great place. Really good, solid Indian food. Think Indian Chipotle: Prices are very similar with the quality just as good if not better. Chicken Tikka Masala and Chai are a go to, it's real Chai and doesn't taste like it's from a tea bag. Tikka Masala is very well executed on flavor. I highly recommend this place to anyone, especially if you haven't been a fan of Indian food in the past, you'll probably change your mind."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Ohio. Try out their Chicken, Lamb, Mango salsa/chutney and the wheat flat bread it is the best. I hope the quality remains the same and I would come here again and again. Don't forget to try the Mango Kulfi (ice cream) it is out of this world."}
{"text":"What a cool place!  Very modern design with large open space and you can see the cooks preparing the food in the kitchen.  The first impression is good.  Feels... clean.  On the way out I used the hand washer machine.  Like a spa for the hands.  From previous visits I have had the chicken tikka masala, samosas, chicken biryani and naan. All of them delicious.  If you use the hot sauce, be careful how much you use as a little goes a long way.  Portions of meat and rice are decent with nice spice."}
{"text":"For being Indian fast food (rare!) in the Cleveland area, Choolaah knows what's up. The food is fresh, location has a clean, bright, modern aesthetic, and there are plenty of vegan and vegetarian options with health info clearly marked. I also love how much of the kitchen is transparent and you can see the large ovens at work! As an Indian Clevelander, I'm proud to have this here! :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful concept and fun atmosphere. Kewl to watch them cook. The mango lemonade was divine"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our first Choolah experience and will go back soon. The food is good and fresh and simply prepared so you can add complexity with the sauces. We got the Perfect Balance Bowl with Tofu, the Lamb Meatball wrap, the black bean daal and a naan. This was a pretty good amount of food, but the bowl was a little small. Next time we'll try the biryani which looked great. I would recommend the chai if you're familiar with the version of this you'll actually get in India (and is very rare in the US) -- but you will want to add a couple sugar packets. The lemonades looked amazing and we'll be sure to try them next time. So as someone who's spent some time in India and been looking for good Indian ever since, I'd recommend it, particularly as a lighter take on Indian flavors."}
{"text":"Oooook it's been about three years-ish? My impression improved, but I still don't think I'll become a regular or anything. Thank god for my previous review - I was able to not make similar mistakes again.   I ended up ordering the veggie croquettes for the BBQ bowl. My dad ordered the same, but lamb meatballs. We both enjoyed  our choices. Now, the side of \"soup\" that comes with it is good but I honestly don't know if I got the right thing. We both ordered different, but they looked and tasted the same... I don't know enough about Indian cuisine to recognize what's right. The wheat naan was just ok, nothing special.   Overall!! Mediocre. Small portions compared to other fast eateries like Chipotle or Piada. Honestly, I don't know how they have 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Fast. Healthy. Affordable and really, really tasty. Everything is well done and the ingredients are fresh. You can watch them make the nan bread. Smart design and grey atmosphere."}
{"text":"What a great concept.  As other reviews have stated, a Chipotle-like atmosphere for quick Indian takeout.  I tried the Lamb Meatballs and the Chicken Tikka bowl on my recent visit.  Both were exceptionally flavored and pretty good for a fast bite kind of place.  The only negative in my book is that there aren't multiple locations.  Hopefully this takes off and they start springing up everywhere!"}
{"text":"This is basically the Chipotle of Indian food. I got the chicken tikka masala and it was pretty good. The chicken itself was awesome- so juicy and tender. The samosas were pretty solid- bite sized with good flavor. I also got the mango lassi (meh). Overall it was a good, quick meal. Nothing to write home about. But, a solid meal when you don't want to spend a ton."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken tikka masala, naan, and chai. First sip of chai disappointed me, it was too plain and tasted like it has been diluted to the point it's not chai anymore. The chicken was excellent and had a very nice smokey flavor to it. The rice and the naan were ok.  Service was very good-saw the customer next to me couldn't decide on the sauce and they were given samples to try before ordering."}
{"text":"Hands down my go to fast food in the Cleveland suburb area. I would hesitate to call it fast food - since it's fast but the quality is insane. Slow roasted chicken that I've never gotten cartilage or fatty bits in. And that's saying a lot because I get it every time and it's never disappointed. My go to is the chicken BBQ with regular naan and either the lentil soup, chickpea masala or tikka masala. I also get mango sauce on the side and maybe a samosa if I have someone to split them with. So I go here when I'm exhausted and I just don't want to cook but need great food. Very healthy, very sanitary, very good quality especially for such a great price I'd pay every night if I didn't think I'd get tired of eating Indian food every night. I love their hand washer by the way."}
{"text":"Had an amazing lunch here today. My fiance took me out to lunch for my birthday and we decided on Choolaah. We both got Chicken Tikka Masala which as always is very good. As well as naan and a order of samosa. All the food was excellent. What made this over the top was i guess perfect timing. The owners happened to be entertaining right next to us and involved us in there conversation and my birthday came up and they treated us to a piece of salmon which to be honest was skeptical about, but after trying is one of the best pieces of fish i have ever eaten. And a few items they are thinking of adding to the menu(sorry i wont spoil the surprise)  The owners love what they do and it really shows in the food and the staff.. Cant wait to come back even thought i doubt i will get the same experience as it was honestly a once is a blue moon chance, but the food and staff are amazing and will continue to check out the menu as we have not had a bad meal yet!"}
{"text":"Choolaah is by far my favorite restaurant in Beachwood. Hell, it's probably one of my favorite spots in all of Northeast Ohio.  The decor is sleek, cheery, and innovative. Every time I go inside, I ogle the long, communal table near the entrance which is partially made out of books.   The staff is very friendly.   And the food - oh, the food!  The Indian food served up at this fast casual style eatery is incredibly delicious. Their yellow lentil daal and chickpea masala are drool-worthy. I'm also a big fan of their pav bhaji - which they've labeled as a side on their menu, but it's definitely large enough to serve as a meal.   If you want to increase the spice, drizzle some Choolaah Fire or Choolaah Lava sauce on top of your dish. These will set your taste-buds ablaze.   Highly recommend stopping here for a bite to eat! It's too good to pass up."}
{"text":"I love the chicken tikka masala and naan. The mango lassi is yummy too. The food is made quickly and fresh."}
{"text":"The Tikka Masala is delicious and the decor is cool. You won't be disappointed. It's a casual place that you order at the counter."}
{"text":"I'm not even typically a fan of Indian food, but Choolaah has something for everyone. They consistently serve high-quality food and take-out is pretty quick. Glad we gave it a try!"}
{"text":"What a great concept!  This place has high quality indian food that is inexpensive and quick.  The chicken masala is juicy and delicious.  I was surprised how good and spot on it was considering how fast we got our food.   The ambience is also great - I really liked the large tandor (clay ovens) that you can see while you eat.  Well done Cleveland."}
{"text":"Choolaah is amazing. Food is great! Staff is friendly. I am a fan of paneer, and usually go with a paneer tika masala bowl. Their lamb meatballs are also really yummy! If you like it spicy, get a side of Choolaah Fire sauce with your order!"}
{"text":"Popular spot for non-vegetarians amongst Indian and non-Indians. Concept is similar to Chipotle but upscale thanks to the decor which is casual chic, Whoever designed this place knew what they were doing - Brilliant idea. The friendly staff does a great job of educating new comers about the concept and food options. The menu is easy to read.  Food: for vegetarians, the food options are potatoes, chic peas or paneer tikka - fresh! The paneer itself is tasty considered it's tandoor (oven) cooked; however the curries are little on the thinner side. Considering the BBQ/tandoor concept, the paneer and meats are not cooked with the curries as you typically find at Indian restaurants. I found the veg biryani ordinary.   Sauce sides: Quantity of side sauces is limited - they should look to double it as its not sufficient for a full meal. They do charge extra for additional side of sauce. The free choolah fire sauce is seriously hot - you have been warned in advance.  Dessert: Kulfi options are Malai and Mango and both are fantastic! They contain no eggs. The truffles are superb as well.  Overall, a little pricey for the vegetarian options compared to traditional Indian restaurants but definitely worth visiting again."}
{"text":"I was skeptical. I like my Indian restaurants to be a little shady, usually. This place is spotless, well-lit, quick, and flavorful. Yes, it's not all that authentic, but it's certainly enthusiastic and tasty. The samosas are a bit small, but flavorful when served as samosas chaat. The paneer cheese is quite good, too. Also, the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"This concept is just so cool. The best way to describe Choolaah to those who may be unfamiliar is \"Chipotle, but for Indian food.\" While this is not a perfect comparison, it paints a picture. You can create a bowl, a salad, a wrap, etc. They also have samosas and other options for nibbles.   On my very first visit, I ordered the Choolaah salad topped with veggies and tofu. The Choolaah salad was very impressive for a fast-casual restaurant concept. In addition to the usual lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers, there were also golden raisins and picked onions on top. The addition of the veggies and tofu turned that salad into quite a lot of satisfying food. I would've loved some more greens to make it feel more like a salad, but honestly, complaining that a salad was too hearty is not really a complaint at all. I topped my salad with the Choolaah ranch, which packed the perfect amount of heat. However, there was a lot of flavor in that salad, so the dressing was barely necessary--just a nice bonus.  The samosas were yummy, but I have had better. I dipped them in the Choolaah Fire sauce for a delicious kick. Actually, one of my favorite parts about Choolaah was the available additions--a variety of sauces, chopped red onions, peppers, and lemon wedges were provided to add to any dish.  At the end of the day, you can get a delicious plate of food at Choolaah. The naan is bomb, the flavors are bold, and the concept is very strong overall. Try the black lentil masala for something a little different, and be sure to add that Choolaah Fire sauce to any and all things."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty food that comes out pretty quick! Tons of options are available, which allows a lot of room for customizability. Tons of vegetarian options too, which I love. Honestly, my only complains are that it's a little overpriced, and that they need to change the music that they play inside (it's not great)."}
{"text":"This place is alright... for the general population that just wants a different cuisine, taste, and blend of spice... it's good Indian food for them. But for people who understand what Desi food should be like... this definitely does not cut it. It appears that they have pre marinated and pre made items that the workers just put together when ordered. There is no chef who works and creates flavors or comes up with new and interesting flavors. I guess one could call it an Indian fast food restaurant with very basic and mediocre menu and flavors. Nothing exciting or worth making a drive for."}
{"text":"5 stars for Indian fast food. Rare to get this right! it is like Chipotle for Indian food. The chicken biryani was delicious! Pseudo Samosa  filling was good but the crust not so much. Great service and looked immaculately clean!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, reasonable with a friendly staff. the atmosphere is awesome. the decorations are awesome. I like watching the chefs cook."}
{"text":"I had the chicken tikka masala bowl and a side of naan.  The portions were big, the chicken was good.  It wasn't too spicy but came with a side of hot sauce.  The place was huge and clean, and I liked the fast casual style.  The bowl for the to go orders was a little flimsy and some of the sauce spilled out but overall I thought it was great."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to try Choolaah after reading several articles and getting positive feedback.   The restaurant has a vibrant contemporary decor and welcoming vibe. I went on a Saturday evening so it was busy but I didn't have a long wait. I wasn't extremely hungry so I ordered a side of veggie masala and a large mango lemonade.  The side was seasoned well with a hearty amount of vegetables that were perfectly cooked. The mango lemonade was slightly sweet with a balanced combination of lemon & mango.  My server patiently helped me  place my order. She was kind enough to tell me I could do a survey and earn a free chocolate truffle. There was now way I was passing this up with my sweet tooth. I must say the chocolate ganache inside and the chocolatey outside melted in my mouth, it was satisfying treat!   I can't wait to try more menu options!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places I have been around here in Cleveland Ohio. I had chicken tikka curry which was amazing with tandoori chicken. My friends had pavbhaji and samosa chat which was also good. Its a must try place."}
{"text":"My recommendation: The chicken sandwich and a side of Samosa Chaat. It's delicious! Full of flavors - savory, sweet, and hints of spice. This is a neat place for a new food experience, even if you've had Indian food before. The atmosphere is casual, semi-fast food style, yet has a modern classy flare. The service is outstanding - the lady who took our order was super polite and helpful to explain the menu. The food is delicious! It's a fun experience! And it's healthy food! Win win win! (I am really hoping this restaurant makes it our way in NC because I would love to each here every week!!)"}
{"text":"Been here twice now...kind of a Chipotle approach to Indian.  Very quick service, very tasty and flavorful.  Several basic ingredient choices, bowls, with naan.   Clean, modern space in a good location. Recommended."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Super family friendly and quick. We are there once a week and the food is always good. My kids love the mango lasses. The naan is very traditional. Definitely recommend this restaurant for families."}
{"text":"A friend picked up carry out for a group. I had the paneer tikka masala. It was delicious! Everyone was raving about the meals they were eating from salads to traditional.   Sounds like a fun place to take kids with the hand sanitizer fountain of some sort. I haven't seen it but heard about it.   Will be checking it out in person soon."}
{"text":"Try this new place today and I really the flavor and the cleanliness,love their sauce bar ,will plan to visit again soon! The only complaint is the portion is too small for the price$$"}
{"text":"Some how this is the first time I've gone here and they've been open for a bit.  I have odd dietary requirements and it was very easy to customize my order.  I got the paneer lettuce wrap with no rice, the veggie marsala side and the veggie croquet plate with no rice/naan.  I wanted to try some and bring some home for my boyfriend.  I'm SO happy I told him I was bringing stuff home because otherwise I could have eaten it all!  The paneer is awesome, their sauces are flavorful and amazing!  The ONLY reason I didn't give them a 5 is they are probably more like $$ than $, it was a little bit expensive for a fast food vibe.  BUT, I will admit that my portion, had I included the rice and naan, probably would have remedied that.  Ok, changing my rating to a 5!!"}
{"text":"Pretty sure I just had a spiritual experience here. I work right around the corner from this place and can't believe it's been open for months and today was the first time I've tried it! Stopped in for lunch with my coworker and I'm pretty sure he'll be returning for dinner.   An Indian version of Chipotle may not seem like a big deal but the entire concept of the restaurant is really what puts it at a 5-star level.  The menu is easy to order from, with not too many choices, but enough to please everyone in your group. It's also a non-intimidating menu for those in your group who may not be as familiar with Indian food.  The restaurant itself is extremely clean and they have large glass windows looking into the kitchen so you can watch the magic happen. There's also a fun hand-washing jacuzzi to make sure you're hands are clean and ready for your meal.   I ordered a plate with chicken tikka masala and a wheat naan with a chocolate truffle for dessert (oh yes!). My food was excellent, the tikka masala came on the side so I could add as little or as much as I wanted to my bowl with chicken and rice. It also came with a side of hot sauce so I could spice it up as I wished (the tikka masala was pretty mild to start with). The truffle was only $.99 and worth every penny. It will be hard to go back there and NOT order one.   Great food, great price, great service, great atmosphere. I'd love to see this place expand and open up more locations!"}
{"text":"I have come to make Choolaah a normal stop on the way home. The food is amazing, the environment is very low stress, the design is beautiful, and the staff are awesome!   Every time I come here, it's busy, but the staff are well versed in what they do and are able to efficiently and accurately deliver a great dining experience!  At this restaurant, you will encounter a counter service style ordering experience. The menu is very uncomplicated, yet gives you a great variety of options to pick from. The restaurant is properly staffed to handle any amount of \"rush\" that they may get during the day. I have never had to wait more than 8 minutes for my food to be prepped and released to me. Expect a very casual dining experience. I would consider pricing to be consistent with Chipotle.   The only qualm that I would have with this place is the parking lot, mainly getting in and out. I can't fault the restaurant for that, however, as Chagrin Blvd. is a nightmare in civil engineering to begin with, so I didn't account for that in the star rating."}
{"text":"Food is fresh. I liked their grilled chicken more than the biriyani rice. The mango lacchi and homemade ice cream was delicious. Decor is unique, and the place is clean."}
{"text":"I brought my family here while they were visiting and we loved it!  I tried this place a while back and wasn't too happy with what I ordered, but I have this saying of trying things out twice.  So, second time around, I was a big fan of the Choolaah salad.  Packed with flavor and the dressing (which I can't remember... something lime?) was really refreshing.  We got the samosas chaat from the street eats section and it was tasty.  I think the masala on top was the chickpea one and it was a good compliment.  We also got the malai kulfi as well and a mango lassi which my mom was a big fan of lol.  Anyways, I'm happy to have tried this out again and the turn out was good."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best!  The concept is good but no one who has any idea about desi food will like the taste!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great atmosphere, the staff is friendly, and the food is great. If you want authentic Indian food this is not the place to go. But if you want a tasty Americanized version which most people in this area probably prefer this is the spot. I like the chicken bowls but prefer the paneer bowls. I've had the biryani and its good. Don't leave until you've had the mango kulfi!"}
{"text":"Fast casual Indian bbq is a great introduction to Indian food. I enjoyed the chicken and salmon, much more than the meatballs or the biryani bowl. The chickpea masala is a great side, though a bit spicy.  The highlight though is the bread. It's a second to naan. Get it?"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic option. Generally when a concept revolves around \"fast\" it tends to fall short at times. Not here. Mind you this is my first time in. I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and samosa. The chicken was great, not dry and flavored well. All the accoutrements were fresh and the sauces very flavorful and worked perfectly with the food. Very cool interior. Will certainly come back!"}
{"text":"Great food, fast casual, clean environment."}
{"text":"Firstly, ignore all the one star reviews docking points for the unauthentic-ness of the food. Their aim is not authentic Indian cuisine, but high quality, gourmet, Indian fast food. It's simply absurd to give it one, or even two stars.  Anyways, once you walk in to the place be prepared to pick your jaw up from the floor; the place is pristine, immaculate, modern, beautiful. The menu is straightforward. The options are varied, but not the least bit confusing. I got the chicken tikka plate with naan.  After you place your order, watch them cook orders through floor-to-ceiling glass panels. There are 4 massive tandoor clay ovens (cutely names eeny, meeny, miny, and moe) in which they cook the naan bread and meats.  After you've picked up your jaw, ordered your food, and admired the cooking of your meal; if you've ever dreamed of giving your hands the treatment of a car wash (I know I have), stick your hands in the automatic touchless hand washer outside the bathroom for a quick 12 seconds while bobbing your head to their modern music played at an unobtrusive volume.   Ok, so your food should be ready now. You go and return your vibrator that they give you to tell you when your food is done. Grab your food and retreat to a a corner table in the glass paneled seating area so that nobody sees your pig-like stuffing of food into your mouth - no room for conversation here.  The chicken is perfectly cooked, tender and juicy. The rice soft and fluffy. The naan was fresh, airy, stretchy, and light. The spicy mango sauce was great and the hot sauce perfectly on point.   Once you're done give that hand car wash thing one more go just for kicks. Grab a delectable mango lassi and some samosas (both amazing) and devour them in the drivers seat before driving home in satisfaction of an excellent meal and a great overall experience.  Ok now for my complaint: pricey for the amount you get, but we expect too much anyways. If you want American sized portions go else-where  Again they've nailed the American-Indian experience, an easy 5 stars. If you want authentic Indian food go elsewhere (NYC or Chicago) or make an Indian friend. Definitely going making a return visit next time I'm on the east side!"}
{"text":"Though rather pricey and a little bit \"over-conceptualized\" as a business, Choolaah is a nice respite from the standard (unhealthy) fast-food dining options as well as an interesting way to market the unique experience that is Indian cuisine to the American masses.  Plus, the leftovers even taste good reheated the following day.  Try everything on the menu.  And enjoy the fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"My husband and I always wanted to try Indian style food and decided to check this place out because of the reviews. Unfortunately it was a huge disappointment. I think the seasoning isnt for everyone. We thought everything had a sweet flavor that didnt sit well with us. The place was clean and had a cool set up though. If you like indian spices you may like it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Choolaah! Often times I struggle with Indian food because of my aversion to all things spicy. This place offers such a wide variety of foods and the spice can be added at their sauce bar, with clearly labeled options of sauces ranging from not spicy to super spicy... I didn't realize until I was there, but the place is BYOB, which is a nice addition to this kind of eatery, which I refer to as \"better food fast\".  The naan is baked perfectly and the dishes I tried were wonderfully flavorful! I sampled both the mint lemonade and the mango lemonade when I was there. The mango is very fruity and the mint was refreshing.   The space itself is nice as well! Plenty of seating options, including an upstairs loft with additional space means individuals and large groups can all be accommodated easily. Plenty of parking in the new development right there."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect and ordering looked a little crazy (a few steps) but it's really nothing at all. The staff make it super easy and will help you by explaining the differences in curry/sauces.   I had the chicken bbq and added grilled veggies. It was $15 and I got 2+ meals out of it. Tons of food and vegetarian friendly too.   The seating area is nice & big and they keep kids at the counter for leftovers. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"A new fast casual Indian eatery in East Liberty. From the first step inside, I was immediately sold by the tall ceiling, fun decor, two-story seating, open kitchen, and the mini swing. Ordering was quick and easy, but there were many options and combos. Reasonable prices. This place can get busy around lunch & dinner times, so plan accordingly or wait it out! 5 different kinds of sauces to choose from too. I went with the Pav Bhaji, one of the street snacks. It's described as an Indian version of a veggie sloppy joe. It comes with these delicious rolls. Perfect for 2 or as a meal itself honestly. I also tried the paneer with wheat naan and tikka masala. The naan was all right. The paneer, although done well, is plain so I'd highly recommend breaking pieces of the paneer into the masala. I'm certainly coming back to try other options!   They have a cool automatic hand-washer - fitting for a place where you typically eat with your hands."}
{"text":"Fast and trendy cultural food is definitely the new thing. Chipotle did it for Mexican food, Banh Mi Boys did it for Vietnamese food, and Chatime did it for Bubble tea. I am pretty surprised to see Cleveland stepping it up as even in Toronto (which has a much larger multicultural population) nobody had been able to do it for Indian food just yet.   Choolaah is everything I would have hoped to see in a casual fast food Indian place.  I have been ordering the chicken plate which comes with tandoori chicken, naan, channa masala and rice. It is a pretty good amount of food and fairly priced. The naan is pretty soft and well made. Chicken tasted really good and wasn't too spicy. I honestly thought the food was much better than Saffron Patch, which is the sit-down Indian place nearby. Overall very satisfying meal.  I really like how they have integrated some of the traditional street foods if India to the menu. A special mention should be made for their samosa chaat. It tastes great and does the perfect job of giving you a glimpse into the Indian chaat scene for the American taste palette.   Also - 4 full sized tandoori ovens and the entire kitchen made available to see? Super cool! Its worth coming in just to see the design of the place."}
{"text":"First of its kind. Not just indian, it's Americanized asiano mexican.  Mixed so many cuisines to end up in one amazing output.  Love their ambience too apart from great food. Always crowded, be prepared for a wait."}
{"text":"Indian fast food? I've never heard of it until I searched on places to eat and found this gem. Just visiting for a few weeks and wish this place was back in Seattle. So delicious. My take out order took less than 5 minutes to prepare and the staff was quick and friendly. I ordered the chicken tikka masala bowl with a side of naan for $9. Totally worth it and plan to come back."}
{"text":"I was quite impressed with this fast casual Indian-ish place. As other have noted, the interior is gorgeous - modern, clean and open to their kitchen so you can see what's going on.   It's a similar concept to Chipotle - you pick a protein, a rice choice, a side (mostly lentil based), a naan - it's a LOT of food for about $8-9. I picked chicken, yellow daal and regular naan. Things are definitely mild in terms of spice but you can add their \"fire\" sauce which reminded me of a vindaloo (vinegar based).  The workers seemed to be really nice and the place was spotless when I stopped. Even better, they have an industrial handwasher for you to use - I think every place, every where should have these as people are dirty as hell. (I also think restrooms should have a \"did not wash hands\" alarm)   In terms of food - really quite good. I've had FAR worse Indian at more expensive prices for sure. My chicken was lean and tasty and their naan is absolutely great. They even had a respectable green chutney for their samosa bites.   For fast food, this place is a winner. They only have two locations now but I would heartily support a third location in Milwaukee!"}
{"text":"Quality food with a good price!  We got the biriyani chicken bowl and the lamb meatball plate.  The plates come with two additional side dishes (we chose the chana and the daal).  Overall a wonderful meal! We were surprised when we opened the box for the biriyani, as it comes with a light flaky bread covering that it baked on top (keeping the biriyani nice and warm!).  The biriyani was a tad bland on its own, but once we added the mint sauce and chana over it, it was delicious.  The hand-washing machine was also a plus!  A flavourful meal, will definitely be going back.  Likely will stick to the plates as it comes with more food (and side dishes)."}
{"text":"I'm in the area for pleasure and decided to explore the options on this menu.  I love Indian cuisine, so i figured this would be a good experience.   I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala bowl and the Samosa Chaat. While the food here is not prepared like a traditional Indian restaurant, the flavors are authentic with a modern twist on the familiar.  One thing that I found surprising is that the Samosa Chaat was very reminiscent of Trinidadian doubles I had while visiting Trinidad and Tobago.  Not exactly the same, but the flavors took me back.   I will definitely swing by on my way out of the area and any time I am in the area.  If you have never tried Indian cuisine, this is a great lead in.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Recommend everyone to go.    About two weeks ago I went around evening time.   These folks know how to keep up with food choice; value of customer's time; creativity through out from kitchen to hand washing.  Lovely people with smile and always there to help u in making correct choices.  I noticed that food ingredients that they have been using is great.  I ordered multiple items and not a single issue.  I like it bit spicy so they did offered me a spicy sauce to add. There vege biryani is awesome.Loved it.  I loved this concept."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch at Choolah. I've been eagerly awaiting its arrival on the Eastside all summer long. It did not disappoint. The interiors are refreshing. Service was impeccable. Our order was ready in less than 5 mins. Mango lassi left me longing for more. I had a plate (chicken, naan, tikka masala). Chicken was fantastic, grilled tandoori style. Plain Naan was fresh although slightly devoid of the crispness. Also shared the samosa chaat. Samosa chaat was just OK, definitely have had much better at other places, lacks the zest n tanginess.   I will return again to sample the whole menu and this is great value for $.    Bottom line: Indian Food, Chipotle Style. Great value."}
{"text":"Best Indian Restaurant in town!!! Excellent customer service, surprised it beat out other Indian restaurants in taste that have been in business for over 10 years. Chickpea rice bowl seems to be the most popular that they're always out. Paneer sandwich is really good if you're a vegetarian. Perfect blend of spices just like how indian food should be rather than what local indian restaurants make here in Cleveland. Menu is limited but still a new favorite spot!!!"}
{"text":"Overall very impressed with this place! They did fast food Indian right with a very affordable menu. The decor is super trendy including a hand washing spa and a very confusing pop machine.   The food was overall well cooked...we tried the chicken tikka plate which was very flavorful, next I want to try the salmon tikka. The chaat was also delicious. The biriyani was only so-so (I wouldn't recommend). The sides were pretty good...some at our table thought the lentils were bland but I liked it.   Will definitely be back and am looking forward to other potential locations!"}
{"text":"Great food. Chicken is so tender and juicy. So delicious. The chutney was not the sweet tamarind ins though. Will totally go again. A bit pricey, but can be affordable with out all the sides."}
{"text":"I love this place.   Quick service   Super clean   Cool aesthetic - especially the spices embedded into the long tables  UNBELIEVABLY DELICIOUS. I got the Choolaah bowl with the lentil sauce and I would definitely order that again.   If you haven't visited, you need to try it out!"}
{"text":"This spot is truly amazing for some fresh, healthy, modern, and quick Indian food. Everything I've tried has been great and fresh. If you are scared of spicy food, don't hesitate to eat here! Everything is made fairly neutral and it's up to you to add the spicy sauces, so have no fear if you can't handle the heat!   Everything here is also a great portion for the cost! Every bowl is at least two servings for me."}
{"text":"A very good restaurant for fusion Indian cuisine. The food is cooked the best way it can be and ambience is really awesome. I love the way how the food is cooked and their wraps are very awesome."}
{"text":"I have never had Indian food before. A friend in the office convinced a group of us to go here for lunch. I ordered some chicken dish with rice and this mango smoothie drink. I was pleasantly surprised how tasty the food was. Has a cool atmosphere inside. And a neat automatic hand washer you have to check out."}
{"text":"We've been regulars at Choolah since the day it opened till we moved out of Cleveland. And even now, when I go back to the Cleve, a trip to Choolah is on the books.   This is not authentic Indian food, but doesn't even pretend to be. Think of it like Chipotle for BBQed Indian food. But much better food, cleaner and overall nicer.   The tandoori roti is fresh as can be! Tandoori chicken and paneer are both nicely done. Biryani is good (but not authentic Hyderabadi biryani of course) All items on the menu are worth trying! The mango lassi is quite good (but not any different from mango lassi elsewhere)  The decor and ambience is casual but clearly a lot of attention has been paid to detail. The table actually has a row of books in the center that have been made a part of the table. There are three tandoors (clay ovens) - each named individually :) Since Indian food is eaten by hand, there is a hand washing station and that in itself is an experience!  Now if they would only open up a franchise in Louisville.. life would be so much better! :)"}
{"text":"loved the concept of fast Indian food, but I was hesitant. Could Indiana food really be served this way? Choolaah did not disappoint, there was not one bite that was lacking in flavor or quality of a sit down restaurant. I would recommend this place to any of my friends."}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty food. A great way to indulge some quick vegetarian and other Indian options."}
{"text":"Apparently \"Choolaah\" is Bengali for \"Chipotle,\" because that's the type of restaurant this is. You can choose a \"protein\" (in the form of chicken, salmon, tofu, etc.) and have it added to a rice bowl or salad. Tasty food, but the prices are WAY too high for the portions served. The salmon bowl I tried cost $12.49; Naan bread is $1.79 extra. Add a $3.49 mango lassi and your meal costs about $18. For that price, you may as well sit down at a real Indian restaurant and enjoy the real thing. Also, another demerit for the loud fashion-show runway music throbbing away nonstop while you try to enjoy your supper. The staff is friendly and the food is tasty, but look around the massive dining area at the trendy globe lights, tiled headers, and 25-foot decorative stack of books about India and you'll see what you're really paying for. If you're the sort of person who doesn't think twice about dropping $11 on a latte, give it a shot."}
{"text":"Full marks to concept of Indian BBQ with amazing taste and ambience. Best restaurant i have ever been to in USA."}
{"text":"Sing it with me, \"Choolaah, Choolaah! Choolaah, Choolaah!\" Okay, do you know how many East Indian restaurants that I have been to?  A lot!  Not only that, I have quite a number of co-workers who are superb cooks whose curries, vindaloos and biryanis would put most restaurant's food to shame.  In other words please don't serve me naan bread, curry or a biryani that has been sitting around for 8 years.  To me, restaurants should treat their customers like their favorite family members.  In other words, restaurants shouldn't serve you something that they wouldn't eat themselves.  That's why Choolaah is such a departure from the average (And I do mean \"average\" East Indian style) restaurant where food sits on a hot table FOREVER!  I would rather have a little bit of a wait for fresh food rather than have old food served to me quickly.  As soon as you step into Choolaah, you get the impression that everything is fresh.  The design of the place is fresh, the wait staff always seems to be freshly enthusiastic about you being their customer and most of all, the food tastes EXTREMELY fresh!   Fresh, I tells ya!  So fresh that you can actually see items being made and being taken out of the tandoori ovens.  Yay!  It's rare to see that happening at most inexpensively priced restaurants where the owners actually WANT you to see how they prepare food and what goes into everything.  (It seems like the more honest the restaurant is about how they prepare food, the more expensive the food is...)  And I like the fact that you can find something to eat here whether you are a meat eater, pescatarian, vegetarian or vegan.  How sweet is that?  And no one there tries to make you feel guilty about any of your food choices.  (I'm so sick and tired of vegans looking at me with disgust on their faces because I eat almost everything.  Hey, my parents grew up during the Great Depression and me and my siblings didn't get the chance to opt out of various food groups.  You ate what was presented to you or you faced it again during your next meal.  End of story!)  You can have one of their tandoor oven BBQ meals with meat, fish or vegetarian options (tofu and veggie BBQ OR you can have a wrap or salad with one of the previously mentioned options.  You can also have a specialty dish (E.g.,Masala Bowl with yellow lentils and rice, Chicken Biryani or Pav Bhaji - vegetarian sliders)  And don't forget to try out their various sauces. (I'm a sauce-a-holic and so is my daughter Muff.  We tried everything and used every sauce in the place in our quest to find \"the\" perfect sauce.  Woo, Lord!)  And don't forget to wash your food down with one of their lovely drinks (E.g., Mint Ginger Lemonade or one of their lassies).  Is it \"authentic\" East Indian food?  No, but who cares?  It's tasty and reasonably priced and FRESH!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant for lunch or dinner.  I have a toddler son who also loves to eat here!  The staff is friendly, the seating area is spacious and clean.  The food is amazing.  I am a vegetarian and usually get samosas and chickpea masala. I've also had the beet salad which is delicious as well.  There is something for everyone on the menu- whether you eat everything and anything like my husband or are gluten free or vegan.  I eat here at least twice a month."}
{"text":"Choolaah is great food, fresh, and reasonably priced. Think of it as the next Chipotle. The naan is hot and fresh, and be sure to hang on to your receipt (and fillout the online survey) to get a free chocolate truffle on your next visit.  Pro Tip: Check out the jazz-hands hand washer by the restrooms. So fresh. So clean."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. The food is fresh and delicious and doesn't take too long at all! One of my favorite places for Indian food."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks and smells very impressive = 5 / 5.  It is as clean as it can be = 5 / 5.  Employees are as polite & professional as possible = 5 / 5.  Seating at the restaurant = 4 / 5. They have various type of seats for every choice. Although they have tables for 4 with some private seating, I felt as if I was packed to seat on that table. The back of the seats are very hard smooth wood, but I wish they had some cushions. I want my back to lean on a soft surface, not on a surface like concrete. There is enough space in the middle which makes it possible the have the 4-seat tables a little longer and wider. Why not?  The taste of food I had = 5 / 5. It was among the best Indian food I had. The naan is very delicious that is good enough by itself. Their tikka masala was very delicious with perfect spice level. They offer extra hot sauce for those who like additional fire.  The prices are 2 / 5, which means they are higher than average, especially when compared with Chipotle. and their portions are unfortunately small. What is the cost of the sauce and rice? Give it like it's free. You are charging too much for snack-size portions.   The reason I compared with Chipotle is because you get similar food. But, the number of items on your plate and the amount of food they give cannot be compared with Chipotle at all. You do not get a big portion and tons of toppings like you do at Chipotle. You get little rice, a few pieces of chicken or lamb balls or salmon or paneer or veggie balls and tikka masala sauce on top. A piece of naan should be offered with bowls for free.  I wish their naans were a little bigger, maybe double of the current size for the same price. Why not? The same for rice and tikka masala sauce. Soda drinks are 2.99 per cup with free refills. I wish I could buy a drink for 99 cent and pay for each cup. For 12 oz indian tea, they charge $2.99 !!!. that is too much guys.  This is an expensive place. I can have 3 times more food for the same price at other indian restaurants. I may come back, but maybe once or twice in a year, and I will not be willing to spend a lot."}
{"text":"Interesting concept for Indian cuisine and definitely worth checking out. The place has a great vibe and I loved the interiors. The organization and layout is great too, they are pretty fast and efficient with orders. It was quite crowded the two times I visited the place. The first time I went with a bunch of friends and it was so crowded we had to wait a bit for us all to sit together. The kebabs were great and the pav bhaji was excellent. Biryani fans beware though, it's got raisins in it, which not all of India is used to. I personally prefer spicier biryani with lots of raita. raisins or anything sweet is a no no. But the flavors and food, while it didn't blow my mind, was comforting and had a home cooked feel to it. The chai is weak, but I still liked it. The mango kulfi was absolutely delicious. The mint ginger lemonade is worth a mention too. I hope they add Hyderabadi biryani to the menu as well and a couple of popular South Indian dishes too. I also hope they add a couple of chicken appetizers or a couple more street food options. Portions are a little small for the price you pay though.   The second time it was takeout. Kudos on using eco friendly packaging."}
{"text":"I loved this place with their different varieties of curries and toppings. The place has a really good ambience and trendy Indian stuff like stack of books stacked for about 50 feet I guess. The food tasted good and with top notch quality."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Never had a bad experience. Even when they are super busy the service and food is awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"There's not one bad thing I can say about Choolaah, seriously. I usually have low expectations whenever a new restaurant opens up. All I really consider is the quality of the food and the service. I mean, it takes time to build a business, financially AND aesthetically. Yet when I first walked into Choolaah, I was shocked it was the only one of it's kind. Like Chipotle or Panera - it seemed to have a very clear image. Trademark slogans and symbols. Nutrition information. Wide, clean open space. A very CLEAR menu with vegetarian and vegan options. Fast service. And of course: quality food and service.  I had indian food a few times, but I never really fully immersed myself in it due to fear. I'm really happy Choolaah is introducing a new food experience for thousands of individuals like myself.  I got the chickpea masala and samosas with the Choolaah fire hot sauce. The chickpea masala is perfect for vegetarians looking to try something simple yet savory. The bowl was filling for my stomach but didn't take much out of my wallet. It starts with basmati rice topped with delicious chickpeas smothered in a zesty gravy.  And don't even get me started with the samosas. They were the BEST SAMOSAS I ever had. So crispy yet so soft on the inside. The hot sauce was intense and rich, tasting like hot peppers and curry went through cell fusion just to make this piquant sauce.  I am really satisfied with my Choolaah Indian BBQ experience. I know they are planning on opening other locations in the future, and I am VERY thrilled for their future and to see them thrive."}
{"text":"Their BBQ chicken is simply the best dish I have ever tasted. And the atmosphere is really nice and they have some latest technology equipment."}
{"text":"Mmmm! Not sure what to say.  Ordered the Lamb Choolaah.  When about half way thru found a small piece of plastic wrap (see picture).  Kind of took the edge off a meal that was pretty good.  Actually finalized my eating.   About half the tables were empty but most were not cleaned/wiped off.  Our table had a lot of crumbs on it as did a few others we looked at, took the cleanest table."}
{"text":"Let's take it from the beginning, shall we? So I walk in to an empty line and stand there staring at three cashier girls who blankly stare back with no greeting. Finally the one girl says she can take you and points to another one of the girls (the clever hand off). I tell her it's my first time, she recommends the usual. I order a rice and chicken bowl with tikka masala and naan. Simple, and probably the most common item they sell. I also throw in an order of the samosas. So I get my food pretty quickly, and I am off. I can't wait to eat it in the car so I smash the samosas and let me tell you THEY ARE DELICIOUS. The sauces the serve with it are truly amazing. So imagine my disappointment when I get to my meal, a few minutes later, where my rice bowl tastes like plastic and microwave. The taste is honestly inedible. I pour the masala on it, which turns out to be nothing more than watered down tomato soup with spices, in hopes it will improve the dish. Nope. So after taking a total of five bites from my bowl (which also is a ridiculously small portion for the price) I decide to eat my naan with the sauces they gave me for the samosas. I finished wishing I had more naan and sauces but angry because that's not what I came for. Word of advice, the multiple indian restaurants around Choolaah serve way better food with generous portions and the tikka masala is actually tikka masala.   Atmosphere is a 10 though. But I can't eat industrial chic."}
{"text":"This place was good when it opened up. Now quantity and quality has gone down the hill. It's that bad that u get stomach pain next time everytime u eat from there. It looks like burnt food or cooked like 1-2 days ago.No meal there is worth the money they ask for, quantity is snack size.  Please do not waste ur money there. No plan to eat there again."}
{"text":"This was amazing! I don't eat Indian food often, but since being in Cleveland I've gone here about 6 times in the last 2 months.   The service is pretty good, and there is a cool hand washing machine (try it then judge). I've ordered all of the main meals and a sandwich, and all were great. I also get the samosas every time I go. The food is the best part, especially when you consider the price. The little chocolates though are a waste of money, the ice cream is better."}
{"text":"Quick and yummy! I've gone twice now. Had a bowl with black lentils the first time and a wrap the second. You honestly can't go wrong with anything there."}
{"text":"They have great Indian food. The food tastes great and it was quick. It also has a very unique design. Definitely recommend and will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm going to put this as simply as I can: GO TO CHOOLAAH! From the moment I walked into this place I felt a vibe that you don't get from a fast food place in Pittsburgh. The menu was extensive but not overwhelming. The service was helpful but not forceful. The portions were plentiful but not gluttonous.   I've never been to such a rapid paced restaurant that was still entirely focused on the customer. Someone who's never had Indian could easily create a flavorful, delicious dish. I highly recommend a Choolaah bowl with tandoori veggies.   In short, I will be returning in the near future and looking to make myself a regular here. I promise you will not be disappointed. I could go on and on but actions speak louder than words and Choolaah screams perfection!"}
{"text":"A close friend was in town and so instead of taking him to a more well established joint, we decided to try the newly opened Choolah. We were not disappointed.  I am a bit of an amateur chef myself and consider my palate to be fairly sophisticated when it comes to all kinds of South Asian cuisine. This is not authentic Indian food - we don't have rice and salad bowls - but it is good, wholesome, high quality Indian food.  I ordered a bowl of rice, yellow daal and the koftas (meatballs). The daal was perfect, the way daal should be cooked. The koftas were a little bland for my taste, but otherwise not bad...soft and the right texture. Paired with the many sauces and onions and the whole dish was wholesome and rich and very filling. My friend ordered the biryani, which, while not bad, still isn't the way real biryani should be, and I come from a city known for its biryani - but then I still haven't found a single place in America that makes biryani the way they do it back home.  The ambiance is good and there's plenty of room to sit. The line moves quickly and at most you'll face a 10-15 min wait on a crowded day. The only issue I had was with the music - being a designer, it bothers me that the music selection to go with such great interiors  could have been better...I would expect Bollywood classics or Indian classical fusion instead of the usual loud pop music.  Tldr: if you're looking for authentically prepared and presented Indian food you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for high quality Indian-American food, this is a great place to get it. Will be coming back to try their tikka masala and chicken next.  Update: went there again with a bunch of friends and tried their chicken tikka masala and pav bhaji. This is hands down the best Indian place in Pittsburgh - the bhaji is to die for. Make sure you sprinkle lemon on top and have the pav with mango chutney."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food in a hip, cool atmosphere. This is Indian food targeted for a cosmopolitan crowd, but still very good taste. The consistency of the taste and quality of food is what makes Choolah one of the top Indian restaurant in the Cleveland area. The hand washer is a crowd pleaser, allowing one to eat Indian food as it is meant to be eaten - with one's fingers."}
{"text":"Fun and new! Bold flavors and fresh ingredients. My girl and I will be sure to return."}
{"text":"Think Apple store meets Indian restaurant.  Big flavor.  Or should I say, BIG FLAVOR?  I was invited to visit Choolaah yesterday with my coworkers for lunch.  When we arrived, I saw this beautiful, stylish, new building that was Choolaah.  When I walked in, I looked around and there were many things to visually chew on.  There were lots of customers, lots of workers, several very large pots that appeared to be cooking food, and a very trendy atmosphere.    I grabbed a menu and within two minutes, the line was gone and the cashier said, \"Next!\".  That's me!  I ordered the chicken tika masala bowl with a side of naan and a Coke.  I was then given a buzzer as I gave the cashier my name.  I had some more time to check out the interior of this place and it became evident that there was a multi-soda fountain, which is always cool, a hand washing station, and a large window that allows patrons to view kitchen food and activities.  I was beginning to like this place very quickly.  By the time I left, I was in love!    Then my buzzer alerted me that my food was ready.  I walked over to the separate counter to pick it up and I was pleased to see a nice portion of chicken, rice, sauce, and Indian bread.  The chicken was extremely flavorful, garnished in many Indian spices and sauce.  It was hot and moist and most of all, fresh!  The sauce had a little bit of heat in it, but not too much.  The rice was delicious and the Naan was warm and moist.  I loved every bite of my meal and I can't wait to try other menu items, especially, the chicken sandwich, which looked amazing.  A co-worker offered me a samosa, which was not too spicy either, and yet delicious.  I wanted more!  I think from a business perspective it was wise to tone down the heat for the typical American pallet.  I think this restaurant is going to do very well.  I think it has the potential to rocket like Chipotle because it offers fresh, well seasoned, fast, and very tasty food.    The restaurant is deceivingly large, so there are plenty of seats.  It was near capacity when we walked in too, but it might has well have been empty with the speed we were served, seated, and done eating.  Finally, Indian food has a chance to reach the masses in Northeast Ohio!  This is a joyous day, my friends.  When is the next one going to open?  The only drawback is that my lunch was almost $14, so this will not be a daily event."}
{"text":"Wow, wowowowow. Pittsburgh finally has an amazing Indian restaurant that I could definitely see myself going to every day for the rest of my life! Best part is, it's a great place to grab something quick without having to deal with the hassle of a proper sit down restaurant!  Once I caught word that an Indian BBQ restaurant was opening in East Liberty, I immediately cleared my evening for opening day a month in advance...T minus 30 days till opening. After a long, painful 30 days of having to drive past the unopened establishment at least 3 times a week, and stopping to peer in through the windows (more times than I'm willing to admit) desperately trying to catch a glimpse of the kitchen testing out the menu...Choolaah has finally opened!!  Stepping in, you're greeted by a very modern, soothing, well lit interior that is very well decorated; I kind of want to know who the interior designer was for this place so I can hire them to redesign my apartment. What stands out the most in the interior is the giant glass walls that encase the 4 huge tandoor ovens. As much as I wanted to break through that glass and fish out a giant skewer of tandoori chicken, I didn't want to cause any delays for the staff...or get myself on their \"no feed\" list.   I stopped by with a couple friends on opening day and it was absolutely packed wall to wall. Surprisingly, the kitchen and employees were absolutely incredibly efficient in managing foot-traffic and sending out hot, delicious, consistent food extremely quickly - it was kind of mind-blowing to observe. Despite the lines going up to the top of the stairs, we made it to the order counter in no time (observing the kitchen hard at work really helps pass the time). We all ordered a bunch of things, such as the Chicken wrap, Choolaah Lamb Salad Bowl, Samosas, Tikki Masala, and perhaps the best Chicken Biryani I've ever had outside of my own home.   Despite ordering almost $90 worth of food, we had our order in hand in around 10 minutes (absolutely unreal given how busy this establishment was on opening day). The drinks were amazing as expected (love their Mango Lemonade and Mint Ginger Lemonade), and the Mango Lassi was refreshing and perfectly smooth with a punch of tartness).   The Chicken Kati Roll was wrapped in naan and loaded with sauces, perhaps a bit too much sauce for some people's tastes, but it is surely packed with some amazing flavors. I especially recommend adding some heat from their sauce bar to the rolls as they can be a a tad bit on the sweeter side. I definitely want to get around to trying their other Kati rolls too. The Choolaah Lamb Salad Bowl was a hit as well - packed with a bunch of different Indian chaat-like toppings, leafy greens, a protein of your choice, and 3 crispy naan tortilla chips. Typically salads don't fill me up, but this one had me struggling to see the bottom of the bowl, in a good way. Lastly, the legendary Chicken Biryani comes in a giant bowl baked with a roti lid to allow the contents to be cooked to perfection - presentation is a solid 10/10 on this one. Nothing beats the excitement of cracking open the top and peeling away baked bread to reveal the stunning colors and aromas of the Chicken Biryani. Kind of makes you feel like a pirate opening up a treasure chest you've been searching all your life for...but I'd take this biryani over a treasure chest any day. Once you have a taste, you'll never want to stop eating this. It's hands down the best chicken biryani I've had from a restaurant, and the pricing is fantastic for the quality and amount of food you're given.   It's very apparent that Choolaah puts great care and attention into the quality of every aspect of their food. The employees are incredible and are more than happy to explain the menu to you and ensure you have an incredible meal. It's safe to say that Choolaah has won me over and has a committed lifelong patron."}
{"text":"Great menu variety and quality of food! I tried the ginger lemonade (would highly recommend) and tikka masala with paneer and rice and naan. The tikka masala was very flavorful and paired well with the paneer but was more enjoyable when I cut the paneer up into much smaller pieces. Also, the naan was a bit dry so I'd stick to the main entrees in the future. Excited to try the other protein options next time.  Although the menu can be overwhelming, the staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. High ceilings, bright lights, and tasteful decor also added to the trendy ambience of this establishment."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for three days and ended up here twice. I just absolutely love how well this place is run, from how clean it is, how fast you order, easy to read the menu, and tons of options to customize. The food was super yummy even though the tikka base tasted healthier than some places it paired really well with the BBQ chicken. It's fast, decent priced, healthy and delicious. I definitely recommend for a quite dinner or super casual date."}
{"text":"First time and was impressed. Food was good and the atmosphere is great. Our food took awhile because they kept entitling the wrong pager number. The owner came to our table to personally apologize and brought use dessert.   I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Coming from somebody who ate Indian food everyday of her life, this place is amazing.   Punjabi Food has my heart -- ate it everyday (well almost) growing up. When I left home for college, I never had the time to actually sit and cook Indian food. When Choolaah came to Cleveland, I was thrilled. When I tried it, I was back at home.   The food is fresh, flavorful, and consistent. Tastes like something my family would make. My main choice is always the lamb meatballs (we call these kebabs in India), the tikka masala (tomato based sauce), and the raita (yogurt). There are also different chutneys that I also like with my samosas.   I have also gotten the chole (chick peas) and pav bhaji, and both are amazing and flavorful as well.   The price is relative to other fast casual places -- around $12 per person. However, you get a protein, a masala, a chutney, rice, and naan. A very good deal in my opinion.   You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool concept. My kid likes to go there to...get this: wash her hands. You'll see when you get there. This place is like chipotle of Indian food and it they do good work. My only complaint is that my wife does not like their chicken biryani because it is not like all of the other Indian places we frequent. The recipe is differs enough that is turns her off. I  am a tikka masala man and it is not the best, but actually quite good, cheap and fast .  I'd like to see this concept take off. It deserves to. BTW, check out the table made of books. I  didn't notice it at first, but it is amazing."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Get the Tikka Masala with lamb in a bowl. Order an extra naan, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the Choolah chipotle.  I was pleasantly surprised by Choolah. Sure, it's not the most authentic Indian food place, but hey, every ethnicity has their fast food, right? Chipotle, McDs, Panda Express (please, no, Panda Express is not Chinese food), and so on. Essentially, Choolah is like a fast food Indian restaurant.  Choolah is like a fancy Chipotle. They got a super cool cleaning hand machine, dysons in their bathroom, and a touch screen dispenser for their soft drinks. Food wise, you can choose from plates, bowls, sandwiches, etc... Definitely chipotle style. I ordered the chicken briyani- it looked like a pot pie when it came out (huh?), but seemed to actually be covered with naan and then the briyani was inside. I thought the naan could have been a little more moist and fluffy, but it did its trick to cover the briyani. The hubby got the veggie croquette plate-he really liked it- he thought it was like a samosa! \"Pretty good\", he said! I actually really liked the tikka masala sauce too that we got on the side.. Their hot sauce wasn't really hot (ie Tabasco like sauce?) but that's ok, I can never handle Indian spice anyways.  Anyways, I thought Choolah was a cool place -fast food Indian food at its best. It definitely fits the Beachwood area, but it's a fun place- I would go back. If you want fast food Indian style where you can actually sit down and eat, just head to Choolah. :)"}
{"text":"We went on opening day yesterday and I must say, it was fantastic!! It was crazy busy and the lines were long but they moved quickly and once you order your food comes out very quickly. Once seeing the lines I thought it would take a lot longer than it did considering it was their first day and most places would still be working out the kinks. But Choolaah was on top of their game! Employees came around with drinks and sauces to sample and there was a woman their doing complimentary henna tattoos. I started with the Mango lemonade - it was delicious!! I would go back just for that. We also tried the Mango Kulfi. It was also very good. We got an order of the samosas and they were delicious and perfectly baked. For dinner I had the chicken biryani which was perfectly cooked under a piece of naan bread. A friend and I also split a chicken wrap, which was very very good. Everything was delicious. And the owner came around multiple times to make sure everyone was happy and satisfied. I will most definitely be coming back here and can't wait to try more things off the menu!  UPDATE: I went back for pickup of an online order. I got the Chicken Choolaah Bowl with tikka masala. I arrived two minutes early and my order was already ready. The employees were extremely nice and helpful checking to make sure I had everything in my order and asking if we needed any sauces. I am still very impressed that things are running so smoothly and it's only opening weekend."}
{"text":"This is my go to when I am in the area.  WHY?  1.  It's good  2.  It isn't expensive 3.  It's good  I typically get a chicken bbq, with white rice, Tika Masala, regular naan, a drink and extra rice and I believe the out the door is less than $15, or somewhere around that.   The service is fast.  Think Panera with the buzzers / pagers for Indian Food.  There is a self-service Coca-Cola machine which is prefer.  I've had the paneer and that was good as well.  I've had the somosas and I found those satisfactory.   They had too many peas for my taste, to each his own.  Parking can be a bit of a hassle.  I have gone during peak dinner tines and have found a spot, I have seen folks fighting over a space.  Definitely go and try it out!"}
{"text":"Came here on opening day as I had been eagerly waiting for Choolaah to open for months. It was pretty crowded, but we got different samples during our wait. The decor is beautiful. Their is an abundance of cool wall art and homages to India. I ended up getting the lamb meatball choolaah bowl with tikka masala and a mango lassi. The mango lassi was lacking a bit of sugar for my taste. We were given a buzzer and the food came out pretty quickly. They had a variety of sauces at the counter, chopped red onion, and chilli peppers. The lamb meatballs were delicious. They were juicy, flavorful, and well seasoned. I was thrilled as they reminded me of my mother's lamb koftas. The variety of vegetables were a nice addition and the tikka masala was good too on the rice. My friend had the chicken and loved it as well. Overall, an excellent addition to the growing pittsburgh food scene. A very well thought out and aesthetically pleasing establishment."}
{"text":"You know a restaurant is a surefire winner when halfway through your bowl of (spoiler alert!) delicious chicken tikka, you go and ask the staff if and when they're planning to open up a franchise where you live. (Answer: not for another 2-3 years, unfortunately :()  Location and ambience - near an old car dealership, the inside is spacious with a modern decor and uncluttered seating areas. There are high tables for groups as well as smaller tables. The ambience is casual and it seems to be a family favorite!  Menu and ordering procedure - Choolah is a Chipotle style build a bowl place, where they have broken down traditional Indian dishes (chhole, chicken tikka etc) into their components. You order a protein ( fish, chicken, lamb, beans, paneer), a plain or wheat naan and a sauce (tikka, vegetable curry etc).  The menu isn't overwhelming unlike a lot of ithe Indian restaurants, and there is a picture of almost every dish on the menu, which is really helpful! There are also lassis (flavored buttermilk), kulfis (creamy dessert) and a few appetizers.  Food - I skipped appetizers because the entrées were HUUUGE. I ordered the chicken tandoori + wheat naan + tikka masala. The chicken comes with rice and all three components are served separately. The meal also comes with mango and coriander chutneys.  The tandoori chicken was finger licking good! Tender, well marinated and just the right amount of spice. The tikka masala was good, not great until I added the tantalizing Choolah sauce (more on that later). The naan was one of the best I've had here, and as a bonus, it stores well and tastes just as good the next day. I also had the malai kulfis (which seemed to be an in house brand) and was wonderfully creamy without being overpoweringly sweet, and the perfect ending to our meal.  Value for money - at just under $10 for a naan, tandoori and curry, this is as value for money as can be!  Saving the best for last, the real MVP of our meal was the Choolah sauce which is free but which you have to fill up separately. Add a couple of pumps to your curry for an instant blast of flavor and spice.  The only thing disappointing about this place is that it isn't in Chicago yet!! :("}
{"text":"My family and I had lunch here today, and I am so happy this place popped up!  It's like an Indian version of a Smash Burger or Chipotle.  Cafeteria style, but a very professional operation.  We ordered the Vegetable Croquettes, the Veggie Biryani, and the Chicken Tikka Masala - the Croquettes were our favorite.  I think that a Biryani should have some kind of meat component, so I will definitely try reordering that one again.  The chickpea masala that came with our Croquettes was also awesome, the naan too!  We got one of our dishes with brown rice, and one with the traditional white and I personally preferred the white :-).  We are really looking forward to returning and trying something else!"}
{"text":"I cannot explain how much I love Choolaah! I wish there were more locations, like one in Oakland (hint, hint)  Options for all dietary preferences! Very delicious options, too. You can either select from their menu or create your own: think protein + bowl, salad, or wrap type deal. You cannot go wrong, trust me.   Please don't forget to try all of the sauces. ALL OF THEM ARE DELICIOUS. Just dip the equally amazing naan in the sauce. Bam.   Their ingredients are fresh and local. I've tried several of the apps and they've all been rather tasty, as well.   Can't go wrong here, I say again."}
{"text":"CHOOLAAH. YES.  My boyfriend and I were originally gonna grab dinner at Noodlehead but we didn't have enough cash so we looked around for other options. Choolaah caught my eye cause I'm a huge fan of Indian food so we decided to try it.  The first impression was incredible. Choolaah is so inviting with its high ceilings, bright interior, playful decor, and just the way they are bringing technology and innovation into the dining experience.  The ordering process was fast and easy, and the cashier helped us a lot with giving us samples and suggestions. I ordered grilled veggies with brown rice and tikka masala, and my boyfriend got the perfect balance bowl with chicken and tikka masala. We also each got a naan, which was crispy and tasty! We also shared the Mango Lemonade which was honestly delicious, even though I'm usually really picky with my mango drinks. It has a genuine mango flavor, and it was refreshing withour being too sweet. Overall, the food was well-made and really good.   One thing I will say is that I really wish the food was spicier. They provide a station where you can get your own sauces and add spiciness to it, but I felt like the spiciest sauce could've been spicier (especially since it's Indian food). Part of the joy I have in eating Indian food is burning my mouth off and being on the edge of crying and I didn't really feel that here.   Nevertheless this place is truly innovative and awesome! I had a great experience and the hand-washing stations were a good touch. The art on the walls were quriky, everything was well-organized, and this place just makes me excited for the future of dining!!"}
{"text":"Stuff here tastes great! The lamb is amazing, and the biryani has a great crust. The food here does not lack in flavor at all. I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"A good take on fast casual Indian food.  The quality is not akin to a sit-down restaurant, however it is priced well and tasty nonetheless.  The service is wonderful and there is a selection of bottled beers available.  I had the Indian beer Kingfisher and the local brewed pilsner, and would say the latter went better with the meal.  Good, open ambiance, and a great environment for a quick meal, takeout or a meetup with friends.  The biriyani bowls are made with a breaded shell like a pot pie.  This is the first time I've seen that, and while it is a novel concept it didn't enhance the meal.  I also had the chicken tikka masala and found it to be delicious."}
{"text":"Price was very reasonable and the lady at the register took time to walk us through the menu and ask questions about flavors we liked. Food is delicious and I have a picky eater with me that cleaned her plate!"}
{"text":"my first five star review. Everything was perfect. Service, food, price and decor. Pretty authentic indian flavor as well. Loved that hand washing thingy they have there!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this restaurant. Like many have said it's a Chipotle build your own meal style menu. Pricing is about the same as other Chipotle style places, expect to spend $10+ dollars for a full meal here. The restaurant itself is appealing inside, Choolaah did a great job creating something different. Although many may not think about bringing their children for Indian food, the windows to the kitchen give great entertainment while waiting for your order.  Keep in mind this is a fast food restaurant and everything is served for the individual and not family style, so authenticity isn't what you come here for. It's more of quick fix Indian where you can get in and out for lunch or dinner. That being said, I think the food is still really great and actually tastes like Indian food. I have had the Chicken, Lamb Meatballs, Paneer, and Veggie Croquettes - all were great.  They have have a number a sauces you can choose form, or try, which is nice for changing things up.  The one comment I have is the portion sizes for the price, specifically how much rice you are given. Sometimes when I go here I get very little rice, not even enough to cover the bottom of the bowl, which doesn't makes sense since this is most likely their least expensive ingredient. Other than that I'm sold on Choolaah!"}
{"text":"This is a very cool and unique place. The food is great. Maybe a little expensive for what you get in return."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.   -Clean modern atmosphere -Awesome concept - founded in Cleveland with plans to expand -Quick service - the line was long, but they had 3 cashiers to take orders -Great food - tender chicken, flavorful sauce, perfect Naan -A little pricey - but I think it's worth it -Will definitely make this place a regular stop."}
{"text":"Place is popular with my friends; major error in Grub-Hub delivery was eventually made right by their manager but unfortunately not in a timely manner. I think he is going to work hard to make things better with communicating with their customers to avoid errors in the future and I thank him for that. He did not ask me to edit my review."}
{"text":"First time here, never again.  I ordered the chicken BBQ on rice and the pieces of chicken were fatty!!  I did not know chicken could have the same fattiness that steak has but this was disgusting.  My husband had the lamb meatballs and liked them but for the price I could have had authentic Indian tandoor at cafe tandoor restaurant in Cleveland heights that is FANTASTIC.  Since we were on our way to the cinemas at Chagrin we tried this place but blech - I'll never waste my $$ here again."}
{"text":"We ordered online from this restaurant a few weeks ago.  When the order came, it was missing one major item.  Calls to the restaurant went unanswered.  I then tried to contact the company in a variety of ways (through the website, etc.), leaving a couple of written messages about the problem.  I have never gotten any response, even though the situation resulted in a customer paying for food that never arrived.  Just now I called the number on the website that is under the heading \"let's talk\" and it seemed as though the number was only for ordering food at particular locations. Really frustrating.  The food we did get was okay."}
{"text":"I heard of this restaurant while in VA where they are in the DC area. I was a great meal at a great location in Beachwood OH! I'll be back. Amazing Indian fare in a upscale casual dining area."}
{"text":"Good quality food with amazing taste. Choolaah is a nice clean modern style eatery with great Indian flavor. I can eat here probably 3 times a week and never get bored. The menu isn't very extensive but it doesn't need to be when every option is delicious. The naan is melt in your mouth good, the heavy spice on the meat is balanced so well with the sides of sauces (the mango sauce is my favorite) and rice, and the tiki and chickpea Marsalas finish off a perfect meal.   They also have a mango lassi drink that's a bit expensive and small but it's dangerously delicious. Like addictive.   Great place for lunch or dinner and very quick food service. It's almost has a fast food feel (you order at the counter and pick up at the counter) but it has all the restaurant taste. Definitely one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to eat today and I couldn't decide where I wanted to go. Then I remember the time my friends introduced me to Choolaah and I decided to come here for lunch again because it was so good.   Think of this place like a Chipotle, but with Indian food. They have different protein options like chicken and tofu for example. And they have online ordering for those who want to place an order beforehand and grab it to go. You have the option to order in the place and take it to go as well.  Anyways, I came around 12:30 so it was bustling because everyone was coming for lunch. It was packed but there was still open tables here and there.   I ordered the chicken tikka masala with the naan and it came out to $9.99 and then I got the mango lassi which was $3.50 extra. The chicken tikka masala was very tasty and I enjoyed it. They give you a decent amount of food but I kinda wished it was a little more. The first time I came, I left a little hungry but this time I was satisfied.. maybe it was because I was super hungry the first time? The mango lassi is always good and refereeing. When o first had it, it reminded me of the gogurt I had when I was a kid but it tasted way better and mango flavored.   Definitely would come back here more often if it was closer to where I live but isn't that what everyone wishes of a place that's good? Will definitely introduce this place to my other friends in the near future!"}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back to Choolaah and test more menu items! I really enjoyed what I chose for my first visit, but everything looked so delicious.  I ordered the Chicken BBQ bowl with Tikka Masala sauce. The rice was cooked perfectly- soft and fluffy. The sauce was silky, flavorful and beautiful. I'm an over-saucer, so I appreciate the amount of sauce they gave. Chicken was cooked beautifully, the naan was delicious and I really liked the mango dip that came on the side too  This was a great experience. The only difficult part was parking. It has become so popular that their lot fills up fast!  But I will say that although we dined at 12:30 on a busy Friday, we got through line very quickly and received our food in good time as well. Everyone was really friendly and the restaurant was very clean. Even the few empty tables were kept clean.  Yay for new spots!"}
{"text":"This was a tasty spot for sure. I had the meatballs which were fantastic. The spices and sauces were perfect. My only drawback was that I could have used a little more food."}
{"text":"I tried the paneer tikka masala - so good! Definitely big enough portion, especially because we ordered naan and samosas. I got the spicy mango chutney/dipping sauce - so good with the samosa.   Definitely recommend the hot sauce, liked both - the green is fairly tame, but the red is hot hot.   Mango lassi was also good.  We ordered takeout, but I noticed they have a large seating area inside restaurant, including a long communal type table, and seating outside on patio. I like that they serve wine and beer as well, so I'm sure I will be back to dine in at some point.   Overall, I loved it. Fresher and more flavorful fast-food alternative, stands up to a lot of Indian restaurants I've been to, so authenticity and flavor are not sacrificed here."}
{"text":"Wow I was totally blown away! I ordered the Choolah bowl with paneer and tikka masala. It was wonderful! The big tasty cubes of paneer were grilled to perfection. I've never had paneer with a nice char on it. I loved it so much! My boyfriend got the Choolah bowl with brown rice, tofu, and veggie masala. He loved this! This was his first adventure with Indian food. He really loved it. While we waited for our meals, we enjoyed watching the kitchen staff make naan in the tandoori oven. It was a cool experience. The space was open and very clean. The crowd was diverse. It was a really great atmosphere. There is a really neat automatic hand washing station- I highly recommend this as well!"}
{"text":"I was in town for work and wanted to try something a little different. This place was GREAT! I don't know a lot about Indian food and the girl behind the counter was so helpful with not only explaining the menu but also giving her suggestions! I ended up with the BBQ chicken meal with white rice, crispy naan and tikka masala. I added in a side salad and a ton of sauces. The spicy mango one was great on my chicken and rice and the tamarind ginger salsa was fantastic on my fresh salad. All of that food for under 15 dollars AND friendly service, I'll be back everytime I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Choolaah Indian BBQ is a fast casual Indian food eatery which I would consider similar in style to Panera Bread. First, I must note that this eatery is a chain and is also located in Philadelphia and a few other states.  The menu is above the ordering area and well lit. You place your order, given a buzzer so that you can pick up your order when ready. They have a condiment as well as various sauces station where you can add things such as onions or spicy sauces to your item of choice.  My husband and I sat in the downstairs seating area but I did notice additional seating upstairs. I ordered the Choolaah lamb perfect balance bowl which comes with your choice of rice, veggie masala, and Tandoori veggies. My husband ordered the veggie croquet chopped salad with tam ginger. We did spring an extra $1.50 for a slice of wheat naan which we shared.  We were parked in the lot that gives you 45 minutes of free parking but as a word of advice-consider parking elsewhere because with the wait time and having to eat your food in hurry there is no way you can be out of there within that time frame. If that is not an issue to you, then the next tier is $3.00 and cards only are accepted for payment. Also, within that garage are a few spaces earmarked for 20 minutes just for pickup only.  We got our food in a reasonable amount of time and while I can say it was good it was most certainly on par with what I would expect from a fast casual restaurant. However, I found that the wheat naan was very soft, moist, and paired well with our meals. It could be used for dipping. I did taste part of my husband's vegetable croquet but it was breaded and seemed to lack flavor.  My lamb meal was good and wasn't overly spicy. I did try one of the sauces that you can fill in a small cup and believe me they are hot. I liked the decor of the place and  the cute way they tell you how you can BYOB from a nearby wine store.   I was amazed as we were getting ready to leave how packed this place got even on a Sunday! It's probably because it recently opened and the novelty hasn't worn off yet.  When you are finished eating there is a disposal station where you can recycle or trash your stuff. They even have an area where you can automatically clean your hands. A very nifty idea!  In my opinion this place is good but lacks the quality of a true Indian restaurant much like Panera Bread lacks the quality of a descent sit down American restaurant. Still, they do cater and if you want to try a fast casual approach to Indian food you would do well here. Prices are reasonable and I would definitely recommend you spend the extra $1.50 for the naan which is like a wrap bread. You can also get it as white naan if you prefer to go gluten free.  Located right on the East Liberty/Shadyside border they have an arrow outside directing you to the parking garage I mentioned on Centre Ave."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I eat here all the time. The food is so good it doesn't feel like fast food. It is so healthy and actually I feel better knowing I'm eating well. I get the BBQ bowl with the added grilled veggies and they are awesome. Don't skip the naan bread which I always buy extra. The mint yogurt sauce is so good I could drink it!"}
{"text":"I was very surprised, and now have another favorite place to go! Food very fresh, taste is incredible, service time respectable, yes its like a chipotle but yet very different, and did I mention the food! Serving staff very helpful to first timers, which was good as I did not know what to get. My wife and I ordered several dishes and all were good."}
{"text":"I've been to Choolaah twice now. I want to love this place because the format reminds me of my favorite Indian restaurant chain in Austin - Tarka. Unfortunately, I've been kind of disappointed in the food and dining experience. Both times I went, it was totally packed inside. Sure, it is new, and people are excited to try it. The space is vast - well, the vertical space is. Seating space, however, is pretty limited and cramped. Some parts are right up against the windows and line, and there's little room for patrons to move around, get toppings, and employees to bus the tables. It is also quite loud. They play music that sounds like you're shopping at an H&M.  As for food - it isn't bad. But also, it really lacks that punch of flavor that I've come to expect and appreciate from Indian food. It really tastes like they dialed back the spices and heat to appeal to the midwest palette, and I'm not very happy about that. They don't offer any spice level when you order - but do have some hot sauces in the condiments area. Unfortunately, those just aren't the right flavor profile - they taste more on the tabasco pepper side of the sauce spectrum, and less on the delicious hot curry spice side. It's just not the same.  Mango lassi is delicious. Samosa chaat is also quite good.  I wish they didn't use so many disposable plates, cups, plasticware. Another negative compared to Tarka.  All in all, I think this place is a fine quick alternative to, say, Chipotle, but if you really want quality and interesting flavors - look to one of the old-school restaurants like People's Indian, Tamarind, or All India. In reality, I can get in and out of People's Indian just as fast as here."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Restaurant is new and food tastes perfect. Will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"Chipotle meets Indian food. If you hate Chipotle because it's not authentic, you'll feel the same way about Choolaah. If, on the other hand, you appreciate the way Chipotle's simple menu combines a few basic elements with more of an emphasis on taste than fast food places, you'll love Choolaah.  The menu is slightly more complicated than Chipotle, but instead of giving your order directly to someone on the assembly line, you give it to an incredibly friendly and helpful person at the counter. If you've ever been stuck in line behind someone staring open-mouthed for several minutes at Chipotle's menu, overwhelmed at choice and unfamiliar words, you'll understand why Choolaah has a better idea.  I ordered samosa, which the clerk marked to be served with the mint yogurt sauce. I had been just about to ask for that. I'm guessing that if you want one of the other sauces, you have to be specific. Added the chicken tikka masala with a side of naan, and a mango lassi.  The clerk asked if I wanted the hot sauce with the tikka; I turned it down. Next time around, I probably will add that or another sauce. The tikka was good, but a bit on the bland side.   The wait was just a couple of minutes; I'd barely had a chance to fill my cup of water. (The lassi -- think mango yogurt smoothie -- was handed to me at the register; they keep them premade in a cooler behind the counter.)  As others have noted, this is a converted auto dealership. When you leave the counter, your first choice for seating is a very long communal table; past that, on two levels, are uncomfortable-looking booths and some tables. Choolaah appears to be popular with families, and that can mean kids running around unattended, either to refill their sodas, play with the hand-washing machine, or just generally prove that their parents have never taught them how to behave in public. But the place is big enough that it would take a lot of customers to make it crowded and noisy.  Choolaah will not introduce you to the full richness of Indian cooking, but that's not the point. It's an Americanized entry point. And I'd rather have that than the 4,671st fast-casual burger chain."}
{"text":"Choolah is a solid bet for quick and tasty Indian food. The line moves quick and everything on their simple menu is divine. I love their Chicken Tikka Masala - it is very mild though so if you like your spice you may have to up the ante with their spicy sides. Their salads with kabob meat, lamb or chicken are also great - albeit can be a little pricey for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Everything was excellent...we each had Perfect Balance Bowls with chicken. Everything was so beautifully spiced and absolutely delicious. The sauce bar had some great sauces of various spice levels, which were fun to try, but my food was perfect as served. Being our first time there, we were treated to samples (wow!) and a really nice overview of the menu. The young man who took our order and provided the explanation/samples was delightful. The Samosa Chaat is NOT TO BE MISSED. Four pieces, perfect for sharing as an app. I have not been able to stop thinking about this flavorful dish!"}
{"text":"Got take out here. It's a Panera type / Chipotle style Indian place that is surprisingly good! I ordered the tandoori chicken plate with the tikka masala sauce on the side (I wasn't sure if I would like the sauce, so I wanted the option to dip), as well as a few other sauces to try as well - I am a condiment wh@re! I also had the naan.   Everything was so good! Although the menu is limited, it has your basics- chicken, paneer, a few sandwiches, salads. Enough to get a quick Indian fix. Plus everything was fresh, fast and reasonably priced.  Glad to have it in the neighborhood for when I don't need a full menu!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good price. Not as spicy as Indian cuisine elsewhere. While I'm not a fan of very hot, spicy food I'd prefer a little stronger spice than what's offered. There is an optional hot sauce that doesn't taste very Indian to me (tastes like buffalo-wing sauce actually). That's an option if you simply want more \"heat.\"  I had lamb meatballs with masala on the side during my first visit then chicken biryani on the second. Both times I ordered pakoras with mint chutney (which is really good). The meatballs with masala is my favorite of the two. The biryani was good but very dry. Possibly the rice was overlooked slightly?  There are a number of other items on the menu to try so I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"WOW. Choolaah. Thank you for the wonderful dinners from the first time we came with yelp and last night. I am always a fan of these express style modern eatery, but man I gotta say Choolah really blowed my mind. First of all, the interior of this place is so unique and immediately got my attention when I walked in. I know the line at this place can be long, but they're long for a reason. It's worth it! Plus, while you wait in line you can observe the wall arts, they're all painted in the recent year, very artsy.   Oh & Please don't forget to try all their special sauces, i especially love the apple flavor one and the green cilantro tasting one. For entree, I got their perfect balance bowl with chicken and tofu. Tofu was additional charged since they don't do half protein. The second time I came I got another protein balance bowl with lamb meat bowl, and my bf got a salad. We both love our food. I love their chick peas masala. If you aren't sure about which masala to pick, you can ask to try it before you order. The food is great, and the customer service is excellent!  For beverage, I got the mango lemonade it was so tasty. I tried it the first time when I came here for a yelp event, i love it so I had to get it again! The mango is very strong, it's not like those water downed drinks you get at the grocery store. Yuuummy.  Overall Highly recommended! If you're hesitating about trying, don't be :)"}
{"text":"I'm officially a Choolaah head. I almost always get the Samosa Chat...it might be one of my all time favorite foods. I also really enjoy their Pav Bhaji, which is like an Indian sloppy Joe. Pile it high with onions and squeeze some lemon on top, and I feel like I'm back in India!"}
{"text":"Great lunch option in an area that has a lot of options.  The food tastes fresh and flavorful, the service is crazy fast, and there is nothing like it around.  I need to try more items on the menu, I keep reordering the same things over and over."}
{"text":"Pretty good for Indian food in a hurry but on the expensive side.  Basics aren't bad but pick up a few things and a lassi and you are over 10 bucks pretty quickly.  Good for a flavorful lunch.   Not sure I would recommend it for dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent atmosphere, and wonderful flavors. They nailed all of it. Staff was knowledgeable and the architecture was cool too. 2 blocks from I-271 too."}
{"text":"I love love love authentic Indian fare. This food hits it out of the park. I love that they spent a few years in India to get the flavors right. I love that they're a locally owned, Pittsburgh company. Shop small business...always, people! I love the bursts of flavor in every bite of food that hit my mouth and tongue. This is probably considered fast/food style Indian food but I don't care because for what it is, it's perfect!!!"}
{"text":"This place is SO cool!!!  Came here early on a Tuesday evening. The employees are incredibly friendly and super helpful. The cashier explained the whole menu to me and pointed out all of the vegan items (I asked her to.)   I picked out a bowl with chickpea masala/brown rice, tofu and tandoori vegetables. It also came with Wheat Naan (which was vegan as well! Ah!) I also ordered a mango lemonade.   They have many sauces to choose from to pair with your meal. I was super impressed.   The meal was delicious!!! I loved the chickpea masala and the tofu! The naan was also amazing. Super fresh tasting.   I was super impressed with the layout of the restaurant and the super cool hand washing machine!! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good for a fast food Indian place. Beautiful facility. Not a ton of variety but I found the chicken tikka pretty solid. It is also great for kids. They have naan pizzas which are a hit with my 4 year old."}
{"text":"The food here is consistently delicious, the service is great (lines are long, but they move fast), and even during busy lunch times there is seating. I work nearby, so I've been here many times (and anticipate coming here many more), so here's what I've noticed so far:  -The perfect balance bowl is perfect for people like me who want variety. Absolutely love it with paneer, and the veggie croquettes are good but you'll need to put sauce from the sauce bar on them (they're a bit dry). I definitely want to try the salmon next time.  -The wraps are on the smaller side. If you are hungry, definitely get more than a wrap.  -Try the naan and samosas as extras! If you get the samosas, be sure to get the tamarind apple sauce.  -The sauces are great! If you're like one of the reviewers below who felt that there wasn't enough heat, get the lava sauce -- it packs a punch. I actually like that the food is well-seasoned but not super spicy, since this allows me to go there with friends of mine who might not be able to handle spice.  -It's not that cheap as far as Indian food goes, but I assume from the lack of tipping that the employees are getting paid fairly, and they also tell you where they source their ingredients from!   An anecdote about the service -- I was given the wrong buzzer today, so of course it never went off. After waiting for a pretty long time in Choolah time (maybe fifteen minutes -- the food is usually ready in five or less), I went up to the counter and asked about my food. After realizing that they had given me the wrong buzzer, they handed me the bowl but switched out my then-cold naan for a fresh one and also gave me free samosas!   The only issue that I might have is that they blast techno and clubby music. Not exactly what I want to listen to while I eat, but I'll bear it."}
{"text":"Indian fast-casual?! Can't be beat. The decor for this place is very cool. You sort of walk in and need to take a few minutes to look around. Ordering can be a bit overwhelming when you literally want to try everything, so go with a friend so you can order a few things and split. Our cashier was very friendly and helpful when we made out decisions and he even chatted with us about culture, which mean he enjoys what he is doing! We ordered a Lassi, Choolah Salad with Chicken, Naan, the  \"Veggie Sloppy Joe\" type appetizer, and the black Lentils with Rice. The Salad had to be my favorite with the Indian-style Ranch dressing (which is more flavorful than the other dressing). It had chickpeas, pickled onions and roasted cauliflower, which made it unique. The Mango Lassi was good, but not as refreshing as I would have thought. It was my first experience so I am happy I tried it. The place is really clean and everyone is smiling. Parking was easy in the lot next door. We paid just $5 for 2+ hours. I will definitely be back to try some more items!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place has to be the most over-hyped restaurant since, well, I don't know when.   I love Indian food and had hoped that this would be a good local alternative to going much further (okay, ten miles, but I'm lazy some evenings) for good Indian food at the Taj Palace in Richmond Heights.   This place is to Indian Food what Chipotle is to Mexican Food, only more expensive. If you need a quick fix of quasi-Indian food, this is your place. If you want authentic, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Choolah is like Indian street food + chipotle to me. I love the ambiance and interiors and the service has consistently been good. It's not really like home cooked Indian food - though it is equally good, just different good. You walk in, order at front desk, when buzzer buzzes you go grab your food and sit wherever you like (inside or sunroom-ish or outside).  For apps/to share, we like their Samosa Chaat. Four smaller samosas (than usual) with chutneys - a good starter.  I am a big fan of their BBQ meals - my fav combo is chicken with wheat naan and chickpea masala. I love their hot sauce. They have recently changed how their chicken BBQ/tandoori is served/cut. I wish they'd go back to how it was before.  Their biryani is very good too. I wish it was served with a bigger serving of raita.  And when done eating (or before) do check out their hand wash jacuzzi. Restrooms are always clean. Parking is easy and abundant.   So, do I like it - yeah! Would I keep going back - yes! Is there room for improvement - yup! Go visit Choolah if you haven't already and do say hello to eeny, meeny, miny, moe!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! They really hit the mark on this one. Consistent and a wonderful place for everyone."}
{"text":"The chipotle of Indian food, yum, loved it.  Fast and hip environment.  I thought it was strange that they had reserved military parking, but when I asked if they had a military discount they said no."}
{"text":"The food here is consistently on point. The premises are 'sterile' clean and the service is excellent. Think \"Chipotle meets Indian cuisine\" but so much better."}
{"text":"For my part, I love that the Chipotle model has spread to other forms of ethnic cuisine! To have options for quick-service food that is diverse and healthy is a wonderful thing and Choolah excels at this.  On our first visit earlier this week we tried two of the BBQ Plates: Lamb Meatballs and Vegetable Croquettes, with Naan and Chana Masala on the side.   The Vegetable Croquettes (think a breaded dumpling of Samosa filling) were tasty, light and not at all greasy. The rice was perfectly done. The Naan was on the crispy side, but very tasty. The Chana Masala was as flavorful as I could have hoped. The sauces that came on the side were well-paired and full of flavor.   Get the hot sauce on the side - it's great!  The interior, which also borrows heavily from the Chipotle model, is bright and modern. I loved the feature where you can see directly into the kitchen from the dining area. It's a fun touch! Plus, it is SPOTLESS in there!  I look forward to coming back and trying other items on the menu. Choolah is a great option for a quick, affordable, healthy meal."}
{"text":"I've been very excited to try this place as I drive past it almost daily and watched the construction.  The space is big and beautiful and well lit. The line, for a Saturday night, was long. But moved quickly. The staff even gave us some complementary drinks while waiting.  The food: as an Indian food snob, I was pretty impressed. Especially something labeled as Indian \"fast\" food. Several of the dishes were average, but a few standouts: -the dal \"masala,\" aka dal makhani - dal makhani takes hours to cook and this was executed very well. The lentils and kidney beans were soft yet had still of a bite. The gravy was silky and well balanced -pav bhaji - the classic Indian street food. The buns were nicely toasted, and the \"bhaji,\" the mashed vegetable and lentil mix, was nicely spiced and excellently paired with minced red onion and chilis.  The tandoor meat, paneer, and vegetables - when you enter the restaurant, you see the gigantic tandoor ovens to the left of the register.  The chicken, paneer, and vegetables were superb. All well charred on the outside. The paneer was soft on the inside, the chicken was still juicy, and the vegetables were perfectly roasted.  Things we could have done without: the samosas chaat. The samosas were just average."}
{"text":"Deliciously flavorful, fresh, not greasy, made to order fast casual meal. I love the Choolah salad and the chicken masala with fresh naan. The Paneer wrap is also delicious. I crave it all! Get it to go or dine in for a bright, open, interactive dining experience."}
{"text":"Unbelievably good food. It's fast, simple, and comes served on paper plates.  Yet, the food is super fresh and impeccable. It's for kids and adults a great joy to eat there because one feels good and healthy after eating. Every time. I can recommend just about everything on their menu.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch and wow! The bbq chicken had great flavor and Tikka masala sauce was spot on with authentic Indian flavors."}
{"text":"Fast food Indian?  I loved it! We ordered the tikka plate, chaat and biryani.  Everything had a nice flavor and I was happy to get a side of hot sauce to spice things up. Overall, it was mild for non spicy food lovers but everything was fresh and flavorful.  Great for Indian food lovers and as a gateway for those less exposed to it.   Cheap. Fast.  Modern.  Fusion. Convenient.  I want one on the west side!  I'd eat it often!"}
{"text":"Opening weekend was amazing. Service was pretty fast with how busy it was and food nice and hot. This is also a BYOB which is a plus with a \"cup fee\" instead of cork fee but it's minimal.  The drinks are also amazing, I had mint ginger lemonade and it was amazing same with the mango lassi. For the first dinner, yes I said first since I bought another to go, I had the tikki masala with chicken, white rice, and vegetables. A side of naan and samosa chaat. It was all very taste and good! It comes \"neutral\" in heat so I added some choolah fire. I loved the combination of vegetables and could see myself getting a vegetarian bowl next visit.  My takeout dinner was very similar, tikki masala with chicken and white rice. It was packaged to go and the sauce was left separate so with this I felt I got more sauce which is a plus. The food also heated up well for meal 2 the next day.   All in all, it's a great \"fast food\" but still quality food. The location is great to meet up for lunch or dinner with parking off the road or garage next door. Plenty of seating on the main floor and upstairs. The kitchen is also open with neat decor throughout the restaurant."}
{"text":"So very good.  You could smell the aroma from down the street. It draws you in and even though the line was long on opening day this was definitely worth it.  The space is bright and open. There is a lot of space and 2 floors of seating. The kitchen is open and the large tandoori ovens are on display.   The food is very good we both went with the choolaah salad. One lamb meatball and one salmon. The salad was delicious fresh crunchy veggies, shredded panneer cheese, grilled califlower, golden raisins and a ginger dressing. I do wish there was a bit more cheese as it was minimal at best. The lamb was well spiced and tender. The salmon was was smokey from the grill. It was good if a little bit overcooked.  We also got the samosa chaat. Crunchy potato samosas with the mint yogurt sauce and crunchy noodles on top. We tried all of the sauces spicy mango, mint ginger, and apple tamarind we're my favorite. We tried the mint ginger lemonade and the mango lemonade too. Both were very good and refreshing.   They also have online ordering and Uber eats delivery."}
{"text":"Really solid and good food. Excellent flavored and numerous options. Each time I've come, I've never been disappointed. Will continue to return often. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Absolutely in love with choolah! I love everything about this place. Clean bright atmosphere, super friendly and accommodating staff! The food is consistently yummy. Ever since I tried it I've been back several times a week."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Choolaah! Tasty and filling-- but doesn't make me feel gross after eating. Super clean and beautiful inside, and fast, friendly, and efficient service."}
{"text":"This place is honestly so amazing. I can't get enough. I always get the chicken tikka and an order of the samosas and every time I am more than satisfied. The best part? I never feel sick after! The food tastes really fresh and high quality. Kudos, Choolaah! You make a hell of a product. The building is also awesome-great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Choolah has become my new favorite spot for quick and delicious meals. Although I was not very familiar with the concept of Indian BBQ, it did not take long to win me over. The atmosphere, the staff, and the food are all wonderful. For a fast casual establishment, they are always so friendly and keep things very clean. I've been here many times and my favorite meal is the choolah salad with chicken. It's delicious and feels fairly healthy!   The lemonades are amazing and as a first time customer they offer to let you sample them. Their ice cream-ish dessert called Kulfi is also so tasty. The mango is my fave.   I would highly recommend trying this place for a cool and different experience if you're looking for an easy, quick, and new place.   And last but definitely not least, it's BYOB!"}
{"text":"As far as fast food indian goes...this is the best I've had.  Customer service and paneer wrap was excellent.  Also the ambiance and cleanliness is impeccable.  Hoping they add saag to the menu. I would recommend this place any day of the week you are looking for an affordable fabulous meal."}
{"text":"Choolaah has cracked it! I have always wanted something like this - an Indian place that allows me to select from a few options and experiment, but still is uncomplicated. And the flavors are spectacular and I know can be trusted to be consistent in quality. Wonderful ambience too, and having the tandoor ovens openly displayed is sheer genius. Well done...makes my top 3 Indian restaurants in the US. Please grow across the US...more people need to savor this."}
{"text":"I REALLY enjoyed this place!! As mentioned in other reviews, it's a fast foody place. I would most closely relate the menu to Piada here in Cle - just a indian version. My biggest concern when i saw their menu before their opening, was that they would lose the indian flavor and spices and focus more on the creativity. Thankfully, this did not happen! Every dish, every chutney, every spice was so on point! YUM!  I love the restaurant itself. Big, spacious, huge windows to the outside, huge glass panes dividing the kitchen with the dining area where you can observe the many chefs busy making samosas, naan, curries, etc. My favorite table is the large one in the front - if you look closely, it's crafted with books and the design in the middle are spines from all the books (the pages dangle below the table) - unique and awesome!  I had the paneer plate - about 5 large chunks of paneer, fresh out of the tandoor, served on a bed of basmati rice with small cup of green mint chutney. The plate comes with two sides - a choice of whole wheat naan, regular naan, or basmati rice (didn't understand this since it comes on rice?) and a choice of tikka masala sauce, lentil soup, or chickpea masala. I opted for tikka masala sauce and whole wheat naan. I also ordered the samosa chaat. (YES, I ate a LOT of food!)   The paneer was delicious. Huge chunks, perfectly seasoned and in the tandoor for the perfect amount of time. I dipped each bite into the tikka masala sauce, which was amazing - had a bit of a kick and the perfect amount of spices. A bit tangy, a bit spicy - loved it. I only had a few bites of the basmati rice that the paneer was served on - not too hard to screw up rice, it was good, i was just focused on all the other flavors on my plate. The mint chutney was also really delicious! I like my mint chutneys a bit spicy and very tangy and that's exactly what this was - I actually used it moreso for the samosa chaat. Though the samosa chaat came with chutneys, the bulk of the chick pea/chutney mixture was on half of each samosa, so I dipped the other half in the mint chutney. Speaking of which, the samosa chaat was pretty good, as well - I could have used more of the toppings, but the samosas and the toppings were all still delish.   The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the whole wheat naan- I only ate a few bites,- it was pretty dry and only a few spots were soft. I went with Andrea Z. and she got the regular naan which looked MUCH softer and not dry at all - I'll probably stick to that next time!  There's a hot sauce that you can get on the side (complimentary) - it is very spicy in my opinion, but very tasty!! I say get it, but don't dump the whole thing in any dish ,you'll lose the flavor of the dish. Just add a bit to taste.   Overall, I paid ~11-12 dollars for all of the food above - NOT bad at all!!   I can't wait to go back!! Mouth is watering as I type! Things I still want to try include: the paneer sandwich, biryani bowl (they bake it with the naan on top of the bowl), lassi, chai, Veggie croquettes, Lettuce wraps, and their desserts!!   -  PS random but def try the hand jacuzzi - a unique and fun way to wash your hands without having to go to the bathroom ;)"}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying Choolah since I was out in Pepper Pike for a doctor appointment. Well, I must say that it sure didn't disappoint!   Choolah is a fast casual Indian restaurant that's fairly similar to Panera, with a little Chipotle thrown in.  The building is super slick and modern looking and there's plenty of parking.  The inside decor is really cool and trendy with a Chipotle-sque feel to it with all the stainless steel and other neat tidbits.  The large windows let you peak into the kitchen where you can see the tandor ovens and fresh food being prepped.  The dining room is pretty huge and they have outdoor seating too.  The hand washing machine is pretty awesome.  Give it a try!  Onto the food... You walk up to the counter to order from the large menu boards.  They make it pretty simple.  For entrées, they offer BBQ Meals, Bowls, Sandwiches, and Salads.  They also have some sides to pick from and a few dessert options. (Samosas and mango lassi! Yesss!)  I opted for the BBQ Meal with Chicken Tikka Masala.  The chicken comes on a bed of basmati rice, with the Tikka Masala sauce on the side, wheat naan (although my receipt said roti?) and a side of spicy mango sauce with a fountain drink.  They hand you a buzzer that signals you when your food is ready to pick up.  I came at a downtime after the lunch rush, so my food was ready in about 7 minutes or so. The food was fantastic with lots of flavor from the sauces.  The Naan was good and nicely seasoned, but it was more chewy than light and airy like a lot of Indian buffets serve it. It was almost a cross between a naan and roti...still really good though!  The chicken was nice and tender and the rice was fluffy.  Lots of food! The Coke Freestyle machines and iced tea machine offered a good drink variety.  My first time a Choolah was a great one and I hope to be back whenever I'm on the east side of town!  Stop in and try it out! I can see this place expanding into a chain restaurant in the near future. They seem to be doing quite well!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Indian food, but this place is a nice introduction to it. Great variety and fresh ingredients. I like the Choolaah Salad with chicken. You can taste the quality of the food. Now I know why during lunch time, the line is always out the door."}
{"text":"Good place to hang out with a group of friends or have a silent lunch or dinner just by yourself. I was here with a bunch of friends over a weekend lunch. There was a big line and we had to wait for almost 15 minutes to get to the front of the line. Interiors are interesting enough to keep you occupied for 5-10 minutes. And the extra time can be spent trying to understand the menu and figuring out how to place the order.   The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful in helping us understand the process to place the order. We got tikka masala with chicken and masala bowl with chick pea and rice. The flavors are subtle and toned down to suit less spicy palate. The bowls come in appropriate quantities. All the masalas are served over rice. So, you can either mix it all together before you start eating or you can mix it as you go. Ginger mint lemonade is the best drink to have on the side while you eat the warm comfort food.   I recommend this place if you are looking for some toned down spices yet flavorful Indian food fare!"}
{"text":"My first trip to Choolah was a definite success. I ordered the perfect balance bowl with lamb meatballs and tikki masala. I also had the mint ginger lemonade as a drink. The entree had plenty of flavor with grilled vegetables and brown rice. The lemonade was amazing. I also tried my girlfriend's mango lemonade and I can't decide which one is my favorite. We also had samosas on the side. My favorite dipping sauce was the apple based one. I plan to go back and try the salmon option and the chicken. There are also a lot of cool things to enjoy about the restaurant art and ambiance. They have several ways of making sure they stay sustainable with recycling, automatic handwashing machine, and compostible plates. I also really like the art and decoration they have everywhere. It gives off current, happy, and safe vibes."}
{"text":"I had never tried Indian food before. The food was amazing and got it in 2 minutes. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"People have been absolutely raving about this place, I simply had to check it out for myself. My first impressions upon walking in were that the place was clean, extremely modern, even futuristic feeling, and full of tons of seating (I'm not overexaggerating here, the location really is quite large). The style is the ever present fast-casual, which is becoming more and more popular these days. Going with this theme, they've made the menu with easy to pick choices and customizable (think Panera lunch menu, but with Indian food). There were quite a lot of options to choose from, and while it wasn't exactly cheap, for a lunch it's pretty average considering the type of place it is. I ended up going with one of their BBQ bowls (I'm guessing it's named not after actual sauce, but for the giant grilling barrels they use to cook their meat, which you can see through glass windows which enclose their food prep area). I chose the lamb meatballs as my protein, and you have the option of either whole wheat or regular naan, as well as a \"curry\" option (lentil soup, tikka masala, or chickpea masala). I ended up going with the lentil soup, and also chose a side of samosas. For beverage options, they have a freestyle coke machine along with mango lassi and hot chai.  As I mentioned before, there is plenty of seating in here, and while the decor is a bit quirky, I found it really comfortable and welcoming. I also want to mention that the service was absolutely great. The girl at the counter answers my many questions, and even introduced herself and encouraged me to ask her later if I had other questions or comments about the menu. As for the food, I found the flavors, I don't know... underwhelming? Certainly not the spicy pizzazz you'd normally find in Indian cuisine however, I do understand the motive here is to make Indian food quick and accessible, so I won't fault them too much for that. My lentil soup had barely any flavor, and the lamb meatballs were a bit dry. It certainly wasn't bad food though, just not comparable to an actual Indian restaurant. The naan was great though, and I left very full for $12 so if you're in the market for a quick lunch that's a little different than your usual chicken sandwich, this place is great to try. I'm settling on 3.5 stars, rounded up to a 4. Not amazing Indian food, but very quick and convenient in a pretty nice location."}
{"text":"Choolaah is a fantastic, great fast food Indian restaurant.  The lamb meatball sandwich with a side of tikka masala sauce and wheat naan area divine!  I highly recommend this place.  I usually eat here 3-4 times a week to quench my Indian food cravings.  You can taste the fresh, quality ingredients and the food is delivered/ready to go in minutes.  Love it!"}
