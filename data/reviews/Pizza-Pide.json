{"text":"#18 on the menu is amazing!  You would probably walk by this spot 100 times and never walk in.  Do yourself a favour and order #18 on the menu.  Flatbread style mixed ingredients pizza.  Awesome."}
{"text":"This was my first taste of Turkish pizza- my friend and I took several buses and hiked through the snow to get here, and it was worth it.  I had to try the #18, which was a sampler to learn what I liked.  And what I liked was anything with spinach and the #11 Sucuklu, which is the Turkish sausage and mozzarella cheese.  Simple, I know, but delicious. I've only been one time but it was certainly memorable, and I'd go back the next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Try the sampler pide - it has a lil bit of everything. A little oily, but once in a while is not so bad :)"}
{"text":"Everything is made fresh to order. The pide dough they use, which is a Turkish flatbread brushed with eggwash and has a slight exterior crisp with soft chewy innards, is simply delicious and goes well with any toppings you put on it. Try a pide baked with freshly cracked eggs - you won't regret it.   Pizza Pide is a great no-frills eatery that makes one product to perfection and is perfect for groups with varying dietary preferences seeking a unique, ethnic dining experience."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan. Good pizza, great price, nice owners, not a generic chain. All good."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good!  Call ahead for pickup and it will be ready in 20, sometimes a little longer on busy nights.    They have a great selection but for first timers I recommend the sampler pizza.  You'll get a slice of about 6 different varieties to try out.    Just make sure you eat it hot!"}
{"text":"On our route to Quebec city, we stopped by this place as our friend recommended it. One of the best Turkish pide we have eaten so far. Try \"etli ekmek\". On our way back to US, it was a must to stop by again and it was the same: very impressive."}
{"text":"Well, I finally gave this place a shot tonight.  The reviews are dead on when it comes to the decor.  That said, I've eaten off the streets in Asia so I was not exactly freaked out.  As for the pizza?  I was disappointed.  It was OK at best.  While their pizzas are certainly unique in shape, they certainly weren't in flavour.  I thought they were quite bland.  Maybe it's my taste buds but I've eaten alot of pizza in my life and it was nothing to write home about.  Had the #18 which apparently is the most popular (tasting menu) but I would say it's quite forgettable.  As for service, the place is way understaffed...maybe they lost some help recently as the owner seemed to be training someone.  +ives: nothing that comes out; -ives: slow service"}
{"text":"1st timer when it came to Turkish Pizza...   This place seems to work well on the number system.  I had the #1 Lahmacun (ground beef with peppers, onions) and the #16 Sebzeli (vegetarian and feta cheese).    I liked #1 the best, especially with the extra parsley, onion, tomato and lemon that you can wrap/fold up within the crispy dough.    Service was friendly.  We did takeaway and it took about 15 minutes even though it was quite busy.  I think I would rather eat in next time since it probably tastes best right out of the oven however there are only about 5 small tables.  Nice change of pace from the usual pizza."}
{"text":"We just early dinner. It is very clean and pleasant. Service is friendly and fast. I'll come back again."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious food, clean restaurant, friendly staff, great prices...what more could you want?!  Seeing the pictures of the restaurant and the food from this place makes me smile all the way from Houston, Texas. I went to Pizza Pide while visiting Toronto and it has never left my heart as it is one of the BEST PLACES I'VE EVER EATEN! I am so much looking forward to eating here again in a few weeks when I'm back in Toronto. I know now that I can't leave Canada without eating here! The food is delicious, the restaurant is clean, and the service is great.   Pizza Pide is best described as a plain-looking hole in the wall with great food. The food is seriously mouth watering!"}
{"text":"Great food, people working there you can actually tell care about the food they put out. Reasonable prices, only ever had the sampler pizza, but really when you can get the best of all worlds why wouldnt you."}
{"text":"God, this place is good!  Showcased on the wall is a menu that features many variations of this Turkish Pizza , but most of them contain beef, which I don't eat. But that's A-Okay, because their Spinach and Feta and Lamb Pides are absolutely scrumptious.  The dough/crust tastes like a hybrid of Pita and Pizza. It is super thin and elastic, with just enough bite. I think they must shellac it with egg wash before putting it in the oven, because what comes out is a glorious golden specimen.  Each Pide only clocks in at about $8. Mind blowing, I know. And to top that off, they tumble a combination of Sliced Sweet Onions, Tomatoes, Curly Parsley, Lemon and Pickled Chilis on to your plate. The idea is to take a slice of Pide, stuff it with these accoutrements, and drizzle a bit of garlic sauce on top before taking a bite. SO YUMMY!  Neither the exterior nor the interior of this joint is impressive, but honestly who cares when the food is this good!"}
{"text":"Ordered 3 pizzas. 1 salami, 1 chicken, 1 cheese. All phenomenal! wonderful staff great place and love the freshness! keep up the great work folks! you gotta love the garnishes  Highly Highly Recommended!."}
{"text":"Well that was a surprise. Always ignoring this inconspicuous pizza place across from G Square, I never realized that in fact, it is not a pizza place at all. They do serve Pizza, but they also serve Pide, a Turkish Flatbread that is really, seriously good.   The SO and I popped in on Saturday between a trip to Home Depot and some grocery shopping. We chatted with the enthusiastic Turkish owner, who was happy to explain to us how everything worked.   I don't eat meats, so we went for a Spinach and feta Pide with ground beef on half. It was made fresh for us, and was ready in about 15 min. Served on a long plank, with parsley, lemon, tomato, raw onion and hot pickled peppers, the Pide is about a foot and a bit long and cut into manageable pieces. We doused it in (Sumac? Chili?) mysterious red seasoning and dug in.   It was REALLY GOOD. Folding in bits on onion and parsley just upped each bite. Delicious.   All sorts of drinks available as well, including a sour and salty Turkish yogurt style drink which I will have to try next time.   Total Damage $9.99 plus tax.  lunch for two.  Bonus Points - Really tasty unique food that is a welcome change. (extra star) - made Fresh to order - Really enthusiastic friendly owner - Lots of options to choose from on the menu - TWO of us ate lunch for $9.99 (extra star) - Nothing else good to eat in proximity - Super Close to my house - You can call and order ahead of time - Street Parking or parking for a few cars in the ally beside the pet groomers - A Million Times better than Pizza.   Minus Points - No frills, nothing to look at, no ambiance.  - No whole wheat - Sketchy 'hood  4.5 Stars"}
{"text":"I'm not much of a fan of traditional pizza, but this Turkish stuff is delicious.  I got my whole office hooked on it and we have a special pizza lunch on a regular basis.  The vegetarians at work love it too!"}
{"text":"This place has gone down since new owners have taken over. The seem not be able to understand simple instructions.  When  you call in and they tell you it will be ready in 20 minutes and I show up 40 minutes later they have not even started my food. When ppl call ahead of time it is because they are in a hurry and don't want to wait!"}
{"text":"The pide is hands-down amazing. Fresh onion, parsley, tomatoes, lemon and pickled hot peppers to give each slice more crunch and texture is great too. I grew up eating lahmajoun and have tried all sorts of pide in the middle east and Pizza Pide is one of the best places I've tried.  Try the lamb and cheese with feta instead of mozzarella - it's salty but delicious!"}
{"text":"GO HERE!  Seriously...do yourself a favor and make the trip to Pape & Gerrard.  Trust me, it's worth it.  I'm partial to the #11 on the menu (Sucuklu - Turkish pepperoni and mozzarella cheese), but they're all good.  I might be a little biased because of my Turkish background, but any time I take any of my non-Turkish friends (which is a few times a year), they all LOVE it!    The owner is super nice and if you're a newbie, he'll always recommend that you try the #18 sampler,  It's great because it helps you understand what your favorite is for the next time you visit...and there WILL be a next time!  Bonus: The ayran (yogurt & water savoury drink).  It's definitely an aquired taste, but it goes so perfectly with your pide and worth the try.  You'll leave there with a happy, full belly and knowing you've helped to support a local business too.  Win-win!"}
{"text":"Pizza Pide.  Say it with me.  Pizza.  Pide.  These are two different menu items.  The latter, which almost all of the reviews so far are about, is not pizza.  It's folded bread stuffed with cheese and slightly-above-average-pizza-joint-quality meats.  The owner is exceptionally friendly.  He's very enthusiastic about the pide and the customer's enjoyment of it.  His genuine interest in which of the flavours of the #18 I liked best was kind of heartwarming.  My favourite part of my pizza pide experience took place right after the 20 or so high school kids got up and left.  I mentioned that there were so many students, and asked a few questions about how often they were there, how many would usually come, etc.  The owner humbly pointed out that, sure, the high school is pretty far away, but the kids seem to come here anyway because this is the pizza they like.  The pide is pretty bland.  It's just cheesy bread.  The cheese was processed and flavourless (mind you, nearly all pizza joint cheese isn't actually cheese, so I don't know that this sets them apart).  You'll want to take advantage of the condiments they have, which I avoided for hygiene reasons (I was eating the pide with my hands).     I wasn't a fan of the wait for my pide to finish baking, but it was nice that they were making my pide just for me.  As other reviewers point out, this means that you can customize yours.  Of the five flavours in the sampler pide, the spinach/feta, sausage, and lamb were the best.  If you're going, I would recommend getting the #18 with those three items, but straight up avoiding the \"chicken\" and spinach/ground beef.  As for the tomato/onion/parsley/lemon combo...sure? The onion and parsley were fresh and a nice side dish.  The tomato was prettty hard and tasteless, though.  Overall, I've had worse.  I'm not from this neighbourhood, so I don't know what the competition is, but for $10+, you should be able to do better."}
{"text":"This is a great place to step out pf the normal boring Toronto taste.  The food is amazing and the stars are really sweet. I was introduced to this place with order number #18 every bite is a different flavor. Now I've just done the exact same thing to someone else and passing on the trend."}
{"text":"I haven't tried everything on the menu, but what I've had, I've loved. We get the Lakmajan (#1), the Turkish sausage (#8 I think), Pepperoni (#9) and the combination (#18 or #19). Excellent taste and reasonably priced.  I don't know what I'm supposed to do with the garden serving of parsley, and the lemon, tomatoes and onions so I just whip up a bruschetta. My wife wraps it in the Lakmajan and seems to enjoy that taste sensation as well.  The people I assume are the owners are some of the nicest  people I've ever interacted with. I think they took over a few years ago, and while they didn't change much, the place is much cleaner and run a little smoother. Everyone should give this place a whirl."}
{"text":"Not only the food was delicious, but the owner gave us Baklava for free as we waited for our Pide a bit longer. We didn't mind the waiting though - smells so great inside.  All in all a very nice experience, call in first if you want to get a take out as the place's so good it will be probably crowded."}
{"text":"My fav forever and forever. I always wanted something eastern but not Shawarma, and I finally found it. The people cooking are women. No offensive but gotta say that, when the cook is made by women its made with love and the taste awesome. I love the food. Staffs are very friendly!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing little place that puts together super tasty \"pides\" (Turkish Pizza) and they do a very good standard pizza too. Pide is a kind of calzone, but with different fillings/toppings. Try from a wide range of options - they're all good. Cheers!  It's a family run place, with super friendly and fast service. You can take out or dine in; the place itself is a bit messy (don't expect luxury) but very clean. It's a great family atmosphere overall and it sometimes fills up with families who come by after prayers at the Turkish mosque next door. They have Turkish newspapers, so people linger, talk and do their meet-and-greet thing.  Bottom line: this is a must visit for the fantastic food, and it's a perfect little corner of Toronto's multicultural mosaic."}
{"text":"I was looking for pizza in the neighbourhood in mid-January, and this place was recommended.  I spied the prepared slices in a display case and decided to take a pass, so can't comment on the pizza here.    The house dish, a Turkish bread called \"pide\" (pronounced pee-da), stuffed with various ingredients and baked, is the way to go.  I had the spinach, feta and mozzarella, and it was quite good.  The pides are pizza-like, but contain a different type of dough and lack tomato sauce.  If I was to have it again, I would probably ask for some sauce, and customize my ingredients like a pizza.  Hopefully, the very friendly owner would go for that.    Greg C. makes a good suggestion with the bonus veggies.  Alternately, you could just squeeze the lemon on the onion (and tomato) as was suggested by the owner, and eat away.  They are mild white onions, and are delicious.  Care is obviously taken with the fresh ingredients.  I was happy to patronize this independent local eatery, and probably will again.  edit. Went back today since Danforth Pizza House was closed.  Asked for a bit of tomato sauce on my pide, added mushrooms to the spinach, feta and mozzarella, and liked it better."}
{"text":"turkish pizza pide in an unasumming tiny hole in the wall (used to be a pizza pizza). Hella hella good."}
{"text":"So good. I mean, they have a ground beef pizza with an egg on it. Amazing. Take out is good and fast, and while the atmosphere is spartan fast-foodish, it's a great place to stop to eat also."}
{"text":"The turkish fast food place to enjoy. The only one close to Greek Town. Don't get me wrong, the place looks a bit bland with bright fluorescent illumination (should I say typically turkish?) and the kitchen takes up half the space of the bistro, but the Pide there is remarkable. You can choose various toppings and then you wait for 10 minutes as everything is made fresh in front of your eyes. Your creation then gets topped with surprisingly tasty hot green pepper and a few plain onion loops and a mountain of parsley but the flavors work well together. Just avoid the spinning pizza warmer, I think it's there to turn your attention to the fresh PIDEs.   It's obviously not fine dining but definitely takes a fresh spin on flatbread carbs...pick one up next time you're in the neighborhood. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great I love coming here. Staff are friendly and the place is clean and simple.  Nice when you want something quick and different"}
{"text":"Co-worker of mine had suggested this place to us and I am forever grateful! We LOVE this place! I hadn't known my coworker for too long  so I was unsure if I could trust his suggestion but he said to 'just read the reviews'... The reviews were so right! This place is amazing!   We've been to this location twice and their other location on Danforth once, I like this the location the most!   The Pides:  We've tried the veal but with cheese, the lamb with cheese, the sujuk which looks like pepperoni and the combination one. By gary favorite has been the lamb one, it never disappoints!! (As I'm writing this review and reminiscing makes me regret not ordering one for home which they re-heat nicely in the oven) The combination one comes with a little bit of the top spellings Pides which I believe are the chicken, sujuk, lamb, veal and spinach and cheese. We weren't too crazy for most of them BUT it's nice to have a veggie with all the heavy meat Pides. Along with the Pides you get served some fresh slices of white onion, tomatoes, some lemon wedges, chiles and parsley. I find the Pide and veggies are a nice duo but I wish they would serve some fresh cucumber with them, they keep the meal fresh!    The drinks: They have this, what assuming to be, Turkish sour cherry soda which goes sooo well with the food! It's not overly sour or sweet which is nice. They have an array of drinks. The first time we went we got the sour cherry drink and another clear looking soda which we weren't fans off because it was too sweet, smelled like candy and we aren't big fans of overly sweet things.  Dessert: They have amazing baklava for dessert! They heat it up a little for you and it's nice. My only gripe with this place is that they don't offer the other type of baklava that is served at their other location, I don't know what it's called but I've posted the photo below. This other type is so good, I sometimes like it over the regular baklava.    The service: They're very nice ans friendly, they've created a positive and comfortable environment.   Overall: this place is far from us but it's worth the travel. The food is great, the service is nice and the atmosphere is comfortable. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Jeez this place has gone downhill. This was my go to Place for Turkish Pizza (Pide) then Alara opened and the Chef Mustafa moved there and I thought this would suffer but surprisingly this place was still better than Alara. But not after my meal there yesterday this place has suffered a lot and the stuff is just bland. I ordered my Lahmahchun (Pardon my spelling as I am trying to spell it phonically) and Sujuck Pide. First for the Lahmachun the dough was great as always but now for the meat topping it was bland and no flavor. Its like they only seasoned it with S&P and red pepper flake here and their thats it. Seemed like a poorly made at home attempt IMO of this addictive stuff.  Sujuck Pide was even a bigger disappointment. The Sujuck (Turkish Pepperoni I guess) was devoid of taste and fell flat. I don't know whether they have changed sources for it or maybe have westernized it for mass market this one was poor reflection of glory days of this place.  They didn't have the pastrama so I was not able to try it out. Don't get me wrong Its still better than your average Pizza Joint by far. 3.5 Stars."}
{"text":"this place is a gem! i visit on the monthly and drive +10km. seriously the best turkish pizza!"}
{"text":"Hey all,  Went by here on a friends request.  Was not sure what to order so they guy gave me one that had basically 6 pizzas in one.  Each slice a different pizza.  Was very good.  Would go again.  Drew"}
{"text":"The food is decent but does not taste too much like Turkish cuisine. Has more Arabic influences to the cooking styles. The location is a bit \"sketchy\" and more designed like a fast-food restaurant."}
{"text":"Second visit - Lahmacun made right when you order, so delicious.  Ayran for the adventurously authentic.   Off the beaten path, but worth the trek."}
{"text":"I only realized recently with Yelp's help that this wasn't a generic pizza joint, but rather their specialty is turkish 'pide', which isn't just a pun on \"pizza pie\", as I'd assumed.  I've been there a few times now, each time I've had a pide, and each time I've enjoyed it.  It's a little different from pizza, but mostly in a nice way.  There are a little more herbs involved, and some come with quite a few vegetables tucked inside.  There's no tomtato sauce, and there tends to be less cheese (which I guess would make it lower-fat).  It's not haute cuisine by any means, but it's enjoyable, filling and made fresh.  Because the pides are made to order, so it's slower than something like Pizza Pizza, but unless you're in a rush, that's probably a good thing.  It's a nice change, and I'm sure i'll be back.  They do regular slices and pizzas as well.  The slices look like they don't sell very quickly, so they rarely seem appealing to me.  The pizzas look good, and they do a walk-out XL for $10, which seems pretty cheap.  I haven't tried their regular pizzas, but I assume they'd be decent."}
{"text":"Amazing eats! Whole family loves this place. Friendly staff and awesome Turkish pizza."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  None of the food here is gluten-free, however it's really delicious (or so I'm told) so the only time I come here is with someone who really wants to get one of their pizzas. We always get it to go so that I can get food somewhere else and we can eat together. If you want to stay here while accompanying someone who will eat the food here, I suggest eating beforehand yourself because the food smells amazing here and you will get HANGRY at not being able to eat it.   If you're not going to accompany anyone here then don't bother going here. You'll just be disappointed that you can't eat delicious pide.   TL;DR no gluten-free options"}
{"text":"Their 'etli ekmek' is one of the best in North America, if not the best. Decor is minimal, like a small pizza joint."}
{"text":"This might be my new fatty indulgence at lunch on a Friday afternoon.   Generous sizes (one pizza would be enough for two people) with good prices ($7-9 each) and lots of choice, this is a unique pizza joint, that serves a turkish style pizza.   Its a piece of dough, with toppings, and then 'wrapped' before putting it in the pizza oven. I liked that the dough wasn't thick and was crispy.   There's different flavours, lamb, salami, chicken, spinach and cheese and a version that includes a bit of everything so you can try. I recommend the lamb.   I couldn't finish it all, and took half home to the hubby who fully enjoyed it after re-toasting it.   The photo shows 3 pizzas he put on a wooden platter for us."}
{"text":"Great Turkish style pizzas at very reasonable prices....you have to try the lahmacun!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend is obsessed with this place so he had to bring me to try it. Pizza Pide is a small neighborhood store serving pizza and Turkish pide (as the name suggests).  We ordered the Assorted Pide (comes in 4-5 flavours) and the Lahmacun. As they make it fresh upon order, expect the wait for your food to be ~15-20 min. Presentation was on point though - our pide was brought out along with a heap of herbs, onions, tomatoes and pickled peppers.  Overall, I enjoyed the food, but I can't say I've been converted to a die-hard Pizza Pide fan. My favourite flavour was the Roasted Lamb, followed by the Lahmacun. I found that accompanying your side with the sauces and vegetables provided adds that additional layer of complexity in flavour, so I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"The Turkish pides are delicious and I would also recommend the mexican pizza. Free garlic sauce YAY"}
{"text":"I haven't dropped a perfect score in awhile. But this place is the cat's meow! They specialize in Turkish pizza which is pide bread with their toppings. They also have pizza slices as well.   The service is really great and out of so many choices that all look good the woman working told me to get #18 which is the assorted. A spinach and cheese,  Turkish sausage, lamb and chicken.   All were amazing. The lamb and spinach were standouts! Your basket is topped with tomatoes, onions, marinated peppers and parsley.   The decor is pretty no frills but the value of the quality of food you get can't be beat! $13 for a small pizza for yourself. It's freshly cooked and more than enough food to satisfy you.   Can someone franchise this place uptown?"}
{"text":"This place is an amazing food gem! Super fresh, delicious and awesome/friendly service. The vegetarian with feta and any with Turkish sausage are a highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm in the Riverdale area quite a bit and I have always been meaning to try Pizza Pide which is a small store that sells Turkish pizza. After trying the food, it's probably the best option in the area and definitely better than anything you will get in Gerrard Square.  I wasn't sure what to order so I decided to get the Karisik ($10.99) which is essentially an assorted pizza with each slice containing their best sellers. It contained grilled chicken, turkish sausage, ground beef and roasted lamb. The Turkish pizza was different from your traditional pizza but it was delicious nonetheless. It came piping hot out of the oven, the crust was done nicely, the mozzarella cheese was perfect and complemented the toppings really well.  Pizza Pide doesn't look like much from the outside but if you're looking for a delicious pizza that's very reasonably priced, then this a place you should definitely try out."}
{"text":"Before I start anything, I need to confess that this is the second time I had pide in my life. I don't know what the standard is, BUT the one I had was just out-of-the-world. I am talking about a thin crusted, overly stuffed pide freshly baked in the wood-fired oven for only $9-13.   We came here on Thursday to grab a quick bite for dinner.  Warning: they do not have AC and the heat from the oven makes the place really hot. They have about seven tables, so you can still eat there. Despite the hot weather we decided to eat there since we wanted to have the food when they are freshly out from the oven. It was well worth the sweat!!!! We got #10 (cheese and veggies) and #16 (braised lamb and mozzarella).Including tax and tip, we paid $31 for two of us.   The crust was so thin you barely recognize it. STUFFED with goodness. Just absolutely delicious. You also get complimentary fresh parsley, slices of onions, pickled peppers and lemon wedges to balance out the heaviness and greasiness of pides.   Two women working there, they were very polite and friendly. They also have regular pizzas but seems like most people get pides here. Just trust me and try their pide!!! You won't get disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesomeness comes in canoe shaped pizza form!  The Turkish style pizza (pide) is the only way to go. Order the #18 (the greatest hits) pizza to start. It's a sampler of all the different pizzas on the menu.  Bonus: a pound of parsley, tomatoes, raw onions and lemon wedges! Wrap them in your slice and enjoy! Big ups to this place."}
{"text":"Great food, found the salomi pide the best. Gave this place an extra star seeing that the price is great for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Order: #1 Lamacun   (1.5/2) Price vs Portion:  (1/1) Taste + food presentation  + Thin naan bread style crust with generous amount of meat  + Blazing hot off the oven + Handful of fresh herbs (parsley, medium spicy pepper,...) and thick fraction of a tomato + beauty to look at   (1/1) ambiance + customer service + clean renovated store  + the female cashier was extremely friendly and courteous + couple books to look at while waiting   (1/1) Wow! + Good service experience makes food 10x better"}
{"text":"I was forced from a friend to try this.  There would be no chance in hell I would ever try this place without a recommendation.  Now onto the pies.  I refuse to call them pizza.  They are not pizza.  They are pies shaped like a vagina with buttered lip of dough. I ordered the #11.  The sausage with mozzarella.  As I ate this vag shaped pie I was in bliss.  The slices of the sausage are very nice and very Turkish tasting. It was also crispy but still moist and supple.   I'm so happy I popped my pide virginity here because if I did it somewhere else who knows what would have been.  I may not have wanted to taste more vag shaped pies.  I highly recommend this place.  I can't wait to devour more of these."}
{"text":"Pizza Pide sits on a completely unremarkable corner, in an unremarkable building, across from an unremarkable mall (see Gerrard Square above - they are trying though), YET, as you might expect from the sly repetitive word setup, they are, indeed anything BUT unremarkable.  As you can see from the photos posted, their take on pizza is quite different than anything ive ever seen.    Aside from the different appearance, the dough itself is perhaps more pastry like - more like challah, like a blueberry bun (might be a bit too jewish of a reference but im trying to bring everyone together here...).  This texture makes for a nice change of pizza pace.  Moreover, fried eggs on pizza!!! Of course.  It's even great to chomp on the fresh onions, parsley and tomatoes they include with your pizza.  Now, don't be fooled by the photos because each pizza is probably the side of 2 calzones, but not as doughy.   Havent tried any other other turkish fare there other than the pizza, but no doubt these recipes come from tradition, family and love and you can feel it with each bite.  So its just to say you wont have to twist my arm to feast on a kebab or two.  The harder it is for me to pronounce the more i want it.  the only drawback, is the ambience, of which there is none. but hey, its a pizza joint.  take it home and eat in bed."}
{"text":"I love pizza pide!  Pide is a traditional style Turkish pizza that is cheap, filling, and way better than a Pizza Pizza.   Don't be discouraged by the sketchy exterior or trays circling \"american\" pizza slices.   Simply order off the menu: the #1 Lahmacun (\"lah-mah-joon\") is our favourite.  The only reason I didn't give it five 5 stars is the fact that the lahmacun guy doesn't work on Wednesdays and they often quote unreasonably long times for pickup."}
{"text":"Amazing joint. Love this place. My first time coming here and it was a great experience. One pizza is definitely shareable for two. But then again, if your coming with an appetite definitely get two.   Why was this place such a great experience for me. The way the food was plated, how fresh everything was. I'd like to say I stepped into a turkish pizza joint IN TURKEY.  Great toppings as well. Especially the amazing garlic sauce you'll find at a lot of falafel joints, and an awesome spicy sauce.   Please support such a great owner and try this place out.   Will definitely return"}
{"text":"As a half Turk and very critical eater, I have to say this place is a slam dunk. No frills decor, you'll hear lots of Turks sitting and eating (not many options in the city, but it shows it's worth the trip), including those who must eat Halal (Muslim version of Kosher).  The food is good, full of flavour and worth an east end trip.  Grab the hot pepper flakes off the counter, as they are uniquely Turkish -- roasted peppers then ground to flaked goodness."}
{"text":"amazing and flavourful canoe shaped pizza. lovely family staff!"}
{"text":"My husband took me to this place for a quick lunch on my birthday.  It was the first time a tried a turkish pizza. We got an assorted one and each assortment had it's own charm. Though I wasn't expecting too much out of spinach and cheese but it turned out amazing and became one of my favorite toppings for a turkish pizza. Since then I have tried it some other places as well so I can say without a doubt that it is by far the best. Going back again today :) YAYYYYY!!"}
{"text":"Love the fresh made pizzas. I've tried about 5 or 6 of them and they are all delicious. Particularly love the thin crust ones and all the generous sides the pizzas come with (onions, parsley, pickled hot peppers, lemon, and tomato)."}
{"text":"- The only thing I have tried here was Lahmacun (#1 on the menu). This is totally different from a regular pizza that you get from pizza piza or pizza hut. Lahmacun came in retangular and very thin slices that were filled up with ground beef. The pizza was extremely flavourful. They also gave me some parsleys, onions and tomatoes that went sooo well with the slices.  - Portion: can fully feed one person, definitely not two if you are both in the hunger mood. But if you already had some food and want another dish to wrap up your meal, then one pizza should be enough for two people. - Price: Expensive (about $12 for #1) very pricey since the portion was small, but it was worth it.  - Place was not big tho, they do provide some sauces on each table. - It took about 20-30mins wait for a pizza, so if you are in a rush, then you should call in half an hour before. - Will I come back? definitely yes, I would love to try more of their food."}
{"text":"Where have you been my whole life?  I was well into my 30's (like deep in) and had lived a comfortable life eating lots of pizza. I'd told friends that pizza was my \"deserted island food\" and that i could eat pizza 24/7. Little did i know i knew nothing about pizza...  And then, one day my life changed. My brother took me to Pizza-Pide. This unassuming place does one thing: pides. If you dont know, the pide is a turkish pizza. The crust isnt as thick, and the thing is just tastier.   That one day at pizza-pide changed my life. Now my deserted island food isnt pizza, its pide.   Go to pizza pide. Order a lahmajun and some other stuff (anything). Its all awesome."}
{"text":"Don't be confused with the decoration and location. At the end, what matters is the taste. It's been a regular stop for me at least for the last 7-8 years. Inexpensive, great taste, friendly service and always fresh. You should try the Dairy Fountain's Drinkable Yogurt with your \"Pide\". Make sure that you shake it very well before you drink it. I have tried all of them, and can't say which one is better. It's always good to try each time one of them. I do call them 15-20 min in advance and place my order for take-out or dine in."}
{"text":"This former Pizza Pizza location was transformed in a Turkish pizza (pide) joint a few years back and has been a great addition to the Leslieville Area since.    Thin crust pizza dough presented either flat like a flat bread or in a boat shaped dough with fresh ingredients like ground beef, salami, cheese, spinach, etc.. and accompanied with fresh tomatoes, parsley, onions and hot peppers really satisfies the pide urge!  Some favorites are the traditional ground beef, feta spinach and cheese and salami.  If you are not sure go for the assorted as you get a taste of three different pides.  Ownership seemed to have changed a few times over the years, but the product for us has always been consistent.  Pide costs between $8-$13 and each pide can satisfy a decent sized appetite.  Wait time is about 20 mins or so per order so you can go across to Gerrard Square if you want to pass some time or try to call ahead before you arrive.  The place looks like a dive with limited seating.  Most people however do take out."}
{"text":"Finally stopped in here today after planning to for at least two years.  Was very happy with it.  Very tasty not too oily Pide.  Had the #11 Turkish sausage and mozzarella. Really enjoyed it.  Very friendly owner   Worth checking out"}
{"text":"Not really in a part of town that I frequent often, but when I'm 'round Pizza Pide is the place for me!  Besides, I really don't know what else is in the area.  ;)  Forgo the traditional slices and hunker down for a freshly made Turkish pizza!  Each pide feeds about 2 peeps with normal appetite or 1 if you're feeling really famished.  They range in price, but are very reasonable at $8-10ea.  Dine in as well as takeout come with some slices of tomatoes, parsley (2 diff kinds!), white onion, & lemon.    (You're supposed to squeeze the lemon atop the pizza slices.)  Order first, eat your 'za &/or drink your exotic juices from the fridge, pay later!  Atmosphere:  No frills, like an older, small-ish pizzeria, but it is clean.  Owner/man behind counter seems very patient 'n kind as I would not be able to deal with, \"What can I buy for $6?\" type customers."}
{"text":"This is a great neighbourhood joint. Fresh baked Turkish pizzas for a reasonable price. The service has been really pleasant and friendly every time I've been here. I live near this place so I just call my order ahead. They have vegetarian (spinach or mixed veg) ones as well. It's my go-to when I want a quick snack or meal."}
{"text":"I was taken here on a date with a Turkish girl so I could experience some real Turkish food (besides her cooking).  I ordered the #6 because it uses fresh lamb instead of sausages or other dried meats.  The pide that came out in about 10 minutes (others are faster) was a large portion for one very hungry person...and I wanted to leave room for baklava (which was excellent).  I also tried some Turkish purple carrot juice (bitter, but not bad) and a yogurt drink (watery and salty yogurt = blech).  The decor is plain and about what you expect from a take-out pizza place.  This place is FAR from downtown by my standards so I won't come back often (or maybe ever), but I wouldn't hesitate to eat at this place again if I were around and craving some hearty, oily, lowish quality pizza-like food without cheese.  Aside from getting a chance to practice speaking some Turkish with the owner there is nothing at all cultural about this experience."}
{"text":"Hell's yeah!  You gotta check this place out. Good pizza cooked the traditional stone oven, turkish way.   Almost everything is good.  A special shout out to the spinach and cheese, lamb and mix beef.   If you are eating it the proper way too, ask the owner for some pickled chili's to go with. Bite the end of the chili and pour the liquid contents onto the pizza. Bite into green chili, bite into pizza.  Enjoy.   p.s the owner is a really nice guy. worth the trek and supporting a local business."}
{"text":"Super fast and friendly service! Love everything there, I think the lahmacun is my favourite However, decor needs work. Food? Amazing! So turkish"}
{"text":"Every savoury item on the menu makes my heart sing. I first became a fan of Turkish food on my stints in Berlin. This place brings back fond Kreuzberg memories."}
{"text":"Turkish Pizza?  Lahmacun is really \"meat with dough\", is a traditional eastern item of prepared food of Turkish origin consisting of a round, thin soft piece of dough topped with spicy sauce and minced meat (most commonly beef and lamb) and straight leaved parsley. *  Pizza Pide is located right across from Gerrard Square. Not my usual area but I am more than willing to travel for food....   - Karisik ($9.99) different toppings on every slice on a thick crust dough  - Lahmacun ($6.99) ground beef blended with tomato, onion and spice on a thin crust  I was a little bit disappointed on the spiciness level. But overall, the food was fresh and made to order... If you need a carb fix, definitely order the Karisik as it was more bread like.  The fresh onion, parsley, pickled chili and a squeeze of lemon juice did make the \"pizza\" less heavy as I washed them down with a salted yogurt drink.  I was eyeing this #21, Ground Beef with 2 Sunny Side Up Eggs?? This strangely reminded me of some Chinese food...   Chinese Pizza??  * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahmacun"}
{"text":"I cam here with the kids this weekend for the first time. We had a pepperoni (kids) and assorted (me). The pides were made to order and came out hot after about 20 minutes. The seating was very casual but great for kids.  The pepperoni was nothing particularly special, and the pepperoni didn't get crispy since it was largely folded inside. Several of the types on the assorted were very good, particularly Turkish sausage and spinach and cheese.  It all came with sliced tomato, parley and onion, plus some extremely potent pickled hot peppers.  Very tasty, but I don't know about the '\"best pizza in Toronto\" hype I've read elsewhere. I plan to come back to try some of the flatbread style they had on the menu."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend and I ordered the lahmacun. The dish was very tasty and had plenty of extra garnishes to add to it (try adding the peppers and rolling it up). Great service (owner?) and overall a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Recently changed ownership, and quite shockingly, it's actually better then before. (Didn't think that was possible).   Here is what you are going to do.  You are going to walk in. You're going to order the assorted pide (#18). You're going to sit down and wait 10 minutes. They're going to deliver to your table. You are going to pour some hot sauce and garlic sauce on the side. You are going to dip and enjoy.  It's amazing."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow wow!  This place is a veritable taste sensation!  Who cares about the decor, the pides are so amazing that you just tune it out when you're eating.    We ordered the vegetable and cheese one, the ground beef one, the lamb sausage one, and a Turkish sausage one, and they were out of this world (my favourite was the ground beef).  The pides come on a long plate along with some fresh onion, parsley, tomato and peppers.  It was slightly daunting at first to be eating raw onion on these pides, but actualy they were phenomenal - not overbearing at all!  Also, finishing off with some baklava (as well as something that looked like baklava which they called \"green desert [sic] with pistachios\") and accompanying it all with some of the lemon drink (which is not carbonated) is fantastic.     The guy working behind the counter is also super nice.    I will return.  YUM.    Side note, although this is a small place, there were a few tables here - we came in a group of 5 and were surprisingly seated comfortably.    Also, each pide is only $9.99 - bargains!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time the place is great! Mind you  I only like the way they make the pizza.  The place could use a facelift..."}
{"text":"Very tasty. My boyfriend and I are new to Toronto and the east neighbourhood so we've been trying out new restaurants. After looking at the reviews on here we decided to give it a try tonight. We got #1 and #11 they were both unique and tasty. Nice thing crust and fresh ingredients. The peppers on the side were awesome. Well definitely get it again."}
