{"text":"Brought a coupon from Buytopia, visited the restaurant last weekend. First impression was it has better look than I expected. We ordered Nachos/Quesadilla/Burrito and an item with banana leaf. Food was really amazing, we loved it. I would love to recommend this restaurant for cheap and best Mexican food."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I would probably pass by a million times but still not really notice or visit. My friend brought me here for the first time. 

This was my first time having \"authentic\" mexican food so I can't really vouch for the quality of the food unless you want me to compare it to taco bell. 

Service is really good and really friendly. There is seating but there is no waiter service. There were 2 men behind the counter, one was taking orders and cash  (i assume this to be the owner) and a younger gentleman making the tacos.

I tried the vegetarian taco (they have the option of either tofu or potato) and it was super filling. I also shared the Quesadilla and Nachos with my friend. Quesadilla was really good but the nachos were just average. 

This place seems to be a popular choice for the people in the area. Lots of people stopping by to get takeout. I will try the burrito next time!"}
{"text":"For cheap fast tasty food, this place is great! Tinga is moist and my fave, but the mole and other options are all nice though  the taquitos break, so shell out for the doublr shell tacos if you dont want exploding single taquitos (though at 3.99 for 3 taquitas and a pop it's an ace deal!)"}
{"text":"Went here one Saturday afternoon as my boyfriend and I were enjoying the nice weather we were having.  I got chicken and pork tacos, and he got a burrito.  Everything is so amazingly cheap, flavourful, and authentic!  I'll definitley be back again to grab a quick bite when I'm craving some Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place just got a pretty serious makeover and menu overhaul, which has its pros and cons. 

The cons: all the prices went up, which means it's no longer a ridiculously good value. This used to be the kind of place where you could buy an excellent, satisfying lunch by scrounging together the change in your pockets. Now you're looking at a minimum of $6 for two tacos, and that amazing $5.99 three taco deal is $6.99 now. Not a huge difference, I know, but it's -just- not quite cheap enough anymore to go there on a whim. The burritos also jumped in price from $5 to $6.95, which is probably the most disappointing thing of all. I loved how you could get a cheap burrito here that was tasty and filling but not the size or price of the more common massive ones from places like Fat Burrito and Chipotle. 

That said, the pros: the whole place looks nicer, which addresses a common complaint in reviews. Also, the menu makes a lot more sense now - the old one was out of date and didn't always have accurate prices. They added fish tacos too, which are very good, and seemed to up the portion sizes of all their tacos. Now the three taco deal has A LOT of food and isn't really necessary unless you're very hungry, or unless you're going there for dinner. So you pay more now, but everything is a little better, and you get more in return. I miss going there for insanely cheap eats, but hey, restaurants have to keep up with the times.

Overall, this is still one of the most underrated taco places in the city and definitely in the Kensington Market. It's no frills, no hipster nonsense, just absolutely amazing, well made food. 

Oh, one thing: I would be so happy, and probably a lot fatter, if this place decided to stay open late instead of closing around 7 every night."}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE this place!  Especially awesome on Mon-Thur: 3 taquitos and a water for under $5.  I've only tried their taquitos but I can undoubtedly say that they are 100% authentic in almost every way!  Reminds me of Mexico 100%.  Only thing I wish is that they had fish as a filling option!  That being said my two favourite fillings are the beef and pork but they are all amazing!  Super friendly staff and awesome neighbourhood to hang out in!  This is a no frills, high quality place!  It is a MUST visit place!  I try to get here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Went here with a groupon. Food was great, service was friendly, clean upstairs washroom, very relaxed eating atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place never gets the love that other Mexican restos on the St. Augusta strip do. In my opinion, there are two experiences people have here, the Mexican one and the Fexican one. (Fexican = Fake Mexican) 

Historically, the \"Mexican\" food served in Toronto is Fexican. Short-cut Tex-Mex. Most of you probably don't know what Mexican food really is, although this is starting to change. That's not our fault, it's all we've ever known. So we ask for it. Because of the demand for Fexican, even Mexicans don't serve up their traditional fare in many restaurants in Toronto. This, also, is starting to change.

So we have this perfectly serviceable taqueria serving bastardized burritos. From what I have seen, they are the most popular item with non-Mexicans. I have no idea what they taste like. When I want a Fexican burrito, I go to a Fexican place. When I go to a taqueria, I get tacos. This is a taqueria!

The tacos are tasty, cheap and filling. They are the closest Toronto has to the cheap and cheerful stalls that dot so much of the streetscape in every Mexican city, town and village, where cooks stand for hours tossing ingredients into tortillas at an alarming rate. They are not gourmet.  I saw that a previous poster said the tostadas had too much lettuce or some such thing, compared to Agave and Aquacate. Don't get me wrong. I loved A&A. The chef is an artist and his food delicious. But comparing A&A to Salsas is like comparing a $40 truffle hamburger with one you pick up from a highway stall. Both are amazing, but they're not really comparable. Also, there is no one right way to prepare Mexican food. If you go to Mexico, you will see countless variations of dishes.  It's fair to just not like something, my concern is holding food up to a standard that doesn't exist.

This is one of the few places I've found lengua and the only place I've seen cabeza. I'm not a fan, but my Mexican spouse is. In fact, this place is his favourite Mexican place in the city. So there's one real Mexican who likes it!

The drawback here is the line. It can move slowly. The last time I was here I was 3rd in line and it took 15 minutes to take my order because the counter person was chatting with a customer ahead of me. Chatting, not taking the order. That left a stronger taste in my mouth than the fiery salsa, and I haven't been back."}
{"text":"The food was great, I ordered the 3 tacos and water combo. I chose the Tinga tacos, which consisted of chicken marinated in a tomato blend with onions and Mexican spices in a grilled soft tortilla. The toppings for the first 3 were onion, tomato and cilantro. You could customize each taco to your liking, down to the meat and 3 toppings included. There is a decent amount of seating with a TV, the staff is friendly and welcoming. This business seems family owned and operated, and is a great place to eat in Kensington Market if you're looking authentic Mexican food at a great price."}
{"text":"This was one of the stops on the UYE: Twoonie and Loonie Crawl. 

$1.25 gets you a taquito (literally \"little taco\"): your choice of filling with garnish on a single-ply corn tortilla. 74 cents more gets you a full-sized taco on two tortillas.

Choose from an array of meaty fillings lathered in stewy juices like pork in chipotle sauce, chicken in mole, or chicken in pepitas (pumpkin-seed puree). They also serve tostados and tortas (Mexican sub sandwiches).

I recommend the cochinita pibil (saucy pork) with pico de gallo and some hot green salsa. Wash it down with a Mexican juice then take all the money you saved and [WARNING: BAD PUN ALERT!] go nuts at the bulk food market around the corner."}
{"text":"If I told you that you that I had an authentic Mexican taco in Toronto, you'd tell me to go easy on the pipe, chief.

There are a four elements to what I consider an \"authentic Mexican taco\". No shredded cheese, fresh made salsa, a double corn tortilla, and shredded/braised meat (not ground beef!!!)

Mexican Salsas meets all of these requirements, but at the same time, I wish they had some less authentic Mexican (TexMex, CaliMex) items like fish tacos, Mission style burritos, etc... But I guess you can't please 'em all!

Anyways, the tacos were fresh, tasty, cheap, and filling. Can't go wrong when these things come together!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get a burrito; mostly because it's only $5, but also because it's delicious. I recommend the mole chicken filling with all of the toppings. I want one right now."}
{"text":"I just went here today, again.  I first went because I bought a deal site voucher and so I tried many things.  The tacos, burritos, soup, and something else, can't remember at this time.  But what I do remember is that it is all very good.  Today, I had a taco doble, which means a double taco.  It filled me right up, just one taco doble, and for less than $3 you can't go wrong.

The family who run the place are very friendly, smiling, polite and let you take your time deciding.  Which, I do a lot.  :)  They give off a good vibe.

The kitchen area is clean, but they really need to go out to the tables more and wipe them down.  Today, I even asked they guy to clean the table, he must have forgot so I held my plate under my chin and ate my taco.  I think the floor could be more spic and span too.  If it wasn't for this, I would give them a five star.

The prices are so cheap too.  Everything's a good deal.  For delicious, authentic Mexican food, it really is a good deal."}
{"text":"I'm just going to come right out and say it: This was the best burrito I've had in Toronto.  The chipotle chicken was out of this world.  I can't comment on the other menu items, or the service since I had takeout, but the burrito alone was enough to make me return....really soon."}
{"text":"So it seems that my three primary food missions in this city are to find the best pizza, barbecue and tacos/Mexican around. 

To this extent I have done a lot of taco eating in Toronto (okay that sounds dirty, but seriously, grow up) and this place would be somewhere in the middle of the pack for me. 

On my last visit here my DC and I split a mix of carnita and Al Pastor tostadas and tacos. 

The tostadas were fine but covered in too much iceberg lettuce and sour cream; they also ultimately fall well short of my personal benchmark ie. the brilliant tinga tostadas they serve at Agave Y Aquate. The tacos were served in double tortillas (which is authentic) and the meats used in both (ie. the carnitas and El Pastor) were quite flavourful if a bit too greasy. 
  
I do have one serious beef with this place however and it is that for a place with salsa in the name Mexican Salsas sure cheaps out on the stuff.  I asked for the spicy salsa on my order (and it had 5 chili peppers beside it on the sign, you heard me, five!) and a) it was so stingily applied to my food that it didn't even really register until the third or fourth bite and b) wasn't that spicy. 

I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt here and chalk it up to the server trying to protect what he felt must have been my weak white boy sensibilities but for future reference, the next time I go into an ostensibly authentic Mexican place and ask for the spiciest salsa on the menu I expect my lips to sweat, my scalp to itch and my mood to switch from amiable to downright anti-social. Is that so much to ask? 

Anyway folks, ultimately this place is still good and it would be a toss up, along with La Tortilleria, as the best backup place to get solid, inexpensive Mexican food in Kensington when you don't want to go to El Trompo or Agave. 

Also in fairness, I hear the burritos are great, but I'm a taco man through and through and have not tried them. 

3 out of 5."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!

First i want to make a correction to the yelp page. It says on Wednesday they are closed, I just went today in the afternoon on a Wednesday.

Anyways onto the food!

3 soft tacos for $6.99 and I got chipotle chicken, steak and pulled pork.

Chipotle chicken- 4.5/5 could use more chicken
steak- 5/5
pulled pork 3.5/5, i'm just not a big fan of pork but very soft and yummy!

I also got a baja fish taco (this was separate and not part of the 6.99 deal. $3.50 for individual specialty tacos). 

BAJA FISH TACO= LIFE!!! 5/5 If i could eat one thing for the rest of my life i think it would be baja fish tacos

Nachos- 5/5. Best nachos i've ever had. they make it fresh for you when you order and fry all the chips for you. they top it off with black beans, sour cream, lots of cheese and salsa! For $6 not a bad deal at all, considering you pay $12 at chain restaurants for mediocre junk.

I finished my meal off with apple soda from Mexico and it was very refreshing.

The workers were friendly, the washroom was just renovated so it's nice and neat and the back area has lots of seating.

I'll definitely make sure to come here.

This place would get a bonus star if they have churros!!!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican salsas, their tacos are delicious. Especially the al pastor ones and carnitas. I love how you don't get charged extra for guacamole on your tacos and their nachos are awesome too. I like this place better than el trompo because it's cheaper but also tastes better. I also like how it's kind of cafeteria style ordering than sit down too."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, always been fresh. Sometimes some of the vegetarian fillings can get a little messy though"}
{"text":"I don't like corn tortillas, but the ones at Mexican Salsas blew me out of the water. My mouth waters thinking about them. There's also an impressively wide selection, with several different kinds of chicken and pork to choose from - seems like they've put some effort into catering to real Mexican afficionados.  This might be the best $6 lunch available in the U of T area, and I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I think that perhaps I go here too often. Jesus knows me by name now.

I love Mexican food, and this is some of the more authentic variety in Kensington Market. I go here for lunch more than any other place because the food is really great, and surprisingly cheap. They don't skimp on the fixins, and you can get a filling lunch for around $5. Surprisingly, that's hard to do in Kensington. I'll keep coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Okay this place is going downhill
hillFast.
todays food was YUK!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is like an authentic taco dive bar.
You get in, order quick, eat quick -- and get out.

If you are super hungry - burrito
If you are medium hungry - tacos (3 for $5.99 Mon - Thurs)
If you want a small meal - taquitos

I had the tacos instead of taquitos (some fillings only available for tacos).
Tacos have a double soft shell.  I sort of wish I got taquitos. I really didn't like the double shell.

For fillings, I had:
* chorizo
* pork shoulder
* carnita

After you select the fillings, you are allowed 3 toppings.
I asked for red salsa, rice and beans, tomatoes and cilantro

They hit the spot but I found my tacos surprising not spicy and not particularly memorable.

I hear that this place is way better for lunch than dinner. 
They sold out of a lot of the fillings and by the end of day, if you are vegetarian they only had a potato filling available.

It's a fine place to grab some tacos, but not amongst the best I've had."}
{"text":"Went back to this place recently and the quality of their food was gone downhill.  Everything seems rushed and haphazardly made and the food isn't bursting with all the freshness and flavour that I once associated it with."}
{"text":"A Mexican fast food joint in the market that hits the spot! The best thing about these places is their casualness combined with attentive service (at the counter) and high quality food. Just because it's fast food doesn't mean it's junk food. No excuses with the wrap and roll style of eating with your hands. Everyone who serves this style seems to put their hearts in it rather than trying to mass produce a burger that looks good, yet really isn't. Walking thru the market and need a quick snack? For just over a dollar, Mexcian Salsas puts together a tasty treat that leaves you satisfied and wanting more. I had the brisket burrito with two different styles of beef along with the green salsa and it was delicious! They also have the imported Mexican soft drinks in glass bottes ($2.25) with flavours like tamarind if you feel like trying something different. There is a seating area at the rear of the restaurant and a TV on with a latin station -one ad showed a guy shaving his chest with a razor...macho stuff!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food because it's family run.

I've been to most of the Mexican places around town because I was on the Tim Ferris 4 Hour diet. There was one great Mexican place on Church that I love but one day I went and they were training new staff. BOOM! My burrito was soggy and dripping everywhere. Mexican Salsas is different, it's family run so it's always perfect.

I used to be a burrito kind of guy. It was easy to eat one and no thinking because there were not many options. But Mexican Salsas changed that. I tried the soft tacos once and just fell in love with it. It gets better each time. Something about the heavenly soft homemade fresh tortillas and the perfected pulled chicken and pork. The combo is so good.

Makes me hungry just writing this and I just ate!  

Food 5/5
Service 4/5
Ambiance 3/5
Value 5/5

=========
Overall 4.8"}
{"text":"Cheap, friendly, authentic and looks like it's family run.  You can't complain.
If this joint was not locally owned and small I would probably give it 2 stars JUST based on the food.
But I want you to fight for these guys- this is the kind of place Toronto needs more of- good, honestly priced food."}
{"text":"Not as great as El Trompo. There, I said it!
It's cheaper, but the quality doesn't match that of the store down the road.
I had the 3 tacos for 5.99. The tortillas were dry and the filling wasn't that filling. It's a good price but the treatment could have been better.

The Toquito's were a bit worse. So pass on these.
Overall the food is decent. It's a more authentic take on Mexican food compared to that Big Bell restaurant. It's reasonably priced but the quality doesn't cut it. For the price, it's alright. I've had better at many other Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Can you really complain when you can get a menu item for $1.25?  This cafeteria style Mexican joint is dirty, quick, and cheap.  It's everything that one would expect in Kensington Market, and it's everything a cheap Chinaman could ever want.

I don't know what any of the taco/taquito fillings are called, most of them I can't even identify the source of the meat.  Love it.  I just look and point.  Nothing I've ever pointed at has disappointed.  You definitely want hot sauce on whatever you point at.

Three taquitos for $3.75 will do you pretty good, I reckon.  A 3.5 star rating for me.  Potential for 4 stars.

TOONIE & A LOONIE RECOMMENDATION: a tasty taquito for $1.25..or two for $2.50 with $0.50 to spare!"}
{"text":"not the best fish burrito - not crispy enough. I prefer the burrito boyz for sure."}
{"text":"I love Mexican Salsas. I eat lunch in the market once a week, at least, and this is the new go-to. The burritos are pretty great, I love love love the mole (chocolate, not coriander, but the coriander one is awesome too). The spicy levels are not at all intense, but the food has tonnes of flavour and a burrito is a seriously filling $5 (tax included) lunch. For some reason, they advertise the burrito as costing maybe $8 in the window, but that is a weird, reverse psychology-type of false advertising. $5! If you're going for the first time, I recommend getting three tacos so you can try the many many different toppings. It's not a vegetarian haven, but they do have some options.

I do need to say that as much as I love Salsas, it is sloooooooow. So, so slow. I think it's getting better but I always mentally run through other options if there are more than three people in line. 

Eating in isn't the best, but you can always sit in that weird Kensington park full of pigeons, as long as the weather is lovely."}
{"text":"This place was ok.  I really had a craving for a fish taco.  I got one here, but there wasn't cheese on it, and it didn't seem like adding guacamole was an option.  Small place.  The taco was messy.  I'm not sure that I would come back here.  I wasn't floored but I wasn't disgusted.  It was just ok."}
{"text":"3 tacos + a bean soup = my favourite lunch in the city. Get the carnitas. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what it is - cheap and quick.  You really can't argue with that.

Need to re-fuel on the fly? Come here.  You can sit down in a clean environment and feel full for not too much cash.

I can't really say I would order the same thing again. The taquito i had was a soft shell but it literally crumbled from the filling it had sitting on it. So much so that the first time i picked it up the soft shell tore apart and i had to use a fork.  Fork with this food is so wrong.

For the price, I would return but with a giant lesson learned."}
{"text":"This is a family run business. The food is really good. The tacos were a steal ($4 for three tacos). The nachos were delicious too. The owner was very friendly. I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"There are many options for Mexican food in Kensington, but this definitely has to be the best option for cheap authentic Mexican eats. For the price of one single burrito at Chipotle, you can get two here, all with fresher ingredients (like freshly scooped avocado), what appears to be mostly homemade sauces and really good sized portion.

The one downside to Salsas is the lack of seating inside. There are a few small, fairly unwelcoming tables along the wall and toward the front. But it crowds into where people will be standing to place their orders. You're better off getting take out if you're thinking about dropping by.

Next visit I want to try the tacos and a few small portions of their menu outside of the burrito offerings."}
{"text":"i had the tacos and i actually know what i ordered, (i am from mexico) and i gotta say... really happy.. even the tortilla is good.. the cochinita a little greasy but i wouldnt want it any other way eheh.. the suadero felt like i had i in mexico and carnitas actually tasted like is suposed to.. unlike most burrito places that are making chains all across the city... i and the whole thing with a drink for 4 dollars... now this is somewhere i am going back soon... i really just hope the prices dont go up. there wasnt much people when i went so i cant really say much about the waiting time"}
{"text":"Went by there today and it has been replaced by another taco joint :-(

I will miss their food a lot but what I'll miss more is their friendly faces. If the previous owners are reading this, thank you for many a terrific meal over the past 3 years. Best of luck on whatever comes next!"}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmmm! Each taco is $2.50 and if you go during Monday - Thursdays it's 3 for $5.99. We got the chicken, steak and the pork. All three were really good but I really loved the flavour of the pulled pork. They give you two pieces of tortilla with a mount of pulled pork on top, and your choice of toppings (ie cilantro, onions, etc). One taco wasn't really enough to make it a meal but it was a sizeable snack. We also got chips and salsa with hot sauce. It wasn't on the menu but I asked for it. I was expecting diced tomato for my \"salsa\" but instead it was a green pureed tomato sauce. It was rather delicious though."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Mexican food in the city, the rice in the burrito was the texture of baby cereal. It was mushy, squishy and gooey. I have been having burritos all around the city for years and this is honestly the worst burrito I've ever had. The meat wasn't even seasoned, also asking for the burrito to be extra spicy it was still not spicy at all compared to other burrito joints. It's lacking I'm filling as well. Also it completely fell part which is strange seeing as it wasn't full with must besides liquid, My mother ordered a quesadilla and said she's had better tasting quesadillas from Costco. My father had tacos which along with being not spicy and completely flavourless also fell apart which he compared to a flakey. My fathers bean soup was flavourless and my dad described it as tasting like a no name can. All in all if I could give this place something lower then a one I probably would but on the plus side the have a wide array of Mexican soda."}
{"text":"This is my fav lunch in TO--hands down!  Yummy & well-priced to boot!  The roasted pork taquitos are the best!  Mmmmm!"}
{"text":"The torta is the best thing ever. They always have the freshest avocado and hand make their Guac as it's ordered, definitely an underrated spot."}
{"text":"Salsas is a new, more \"legit\" Mexican food experience in Kensington Market (legit is in quotes because... I've never had real Mexican!). I ate there last week, and had a really good experience!

The food was not what I am used to when I think \"Mexican\", I guess that's because I'm used to the Americanized version. But being a bit different really made it a better experience overall. The menu has a lot of selection with a lot of choices - including nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and much more. There were a variety of toppings and meats to add on to your meal. The best thing about the place was that I had a burrito (as big as a large at Big Fat Burrito, and burrito fans know it is large), for only FIVE DOLLARS - taxes in! 

Though the price might by the biggest selling feature of this place, the food was really quite tasty! I had the \"Pork Shoulder\" burrito (can't remember the Spanish name... whoops), and it was quite delicious. I prefer mild food and this was just right. The friends I was with complained that the parsley added to the burritos was a strange taste combination, but I really enjoyed it! The fillings were evenly distributed throughout the burrito, which was a plus, and it wasn't all horribly watery and messy at the bottom. 

The decor and atmosphere of the place was good too - not exactly upscale or classy, but certainly decent with ample seating room. The staff were very friendly, and as we were clearly overwhelmed by the menu (it being our first time there), they were quite helpful with explaining the set-up and the Spanish we were unfamiliar with. 

I would certainly recommend this place, and I plan to return, considering the quality for the price. The only reason this isn't a 5 star rating is because I actually prefer the Tex-Mex kind of Mexican, and the atmosphere is not A+, but for a student on a budget, or someone who likes the real deal, this place is for you!"}
{"text":"On Monday-Thursday this place does 3 tacos for $5.99. Hellz yeah!

Even better, you can get three different kinds of tacos. They have at least 10 different meat selections for the fillings plus 2-3 vegetarian ones. 

Each taco came on two separate soft corn tortillas, so if you make a mess eating the first one, you have an extra tortilla to pick up the slops. You get your pick of 4 salsas (from mild to super spicy) and some other toppings (fresh onions, tomatoes, cilantro).

The MOLE chicken was easily my favourite (pulled chicken with chocolate and spice sauce), but the spicy pulled pork and shredded beef were good options too.

Cafeteria style ordering at the front. Friendly Mexican server who brought me out a free drink afterward. (Score!) 

Lots of interior tables but VERY sadly, no patio! This place needs a patio as all their nearby competition (Jumbo Empanadas, Agave, Arepa Market, Tacos El Asador) has some kind of outdoor seating available."}
{"text":"Other people in my group raved about their food, for me it was just decent. I ordered the torta: the bread was FANTASTICALLY fresh, the meat to fillers (beans, lettuce etc.) ratio was really good. I didn't really enjoy the meat I picked out - shredded beef. I'll go back and try it with something else.

Everyone else said the taquitos and other offerings were good. The last thing on the menu (I forgot what it is) was really small."}
{"text":"3.5 stars
super fast, reasonably tasty, and superb value.
Back when people were rioting against the G8 summit, I had the pleasure of discovering Mexican Salsas thanks to a little Yelp crawl organized by the great Neil T! Mexican Salsas has since served as a standby for lightning fast, cheap snack joint. 

$1.25, that's right, 1.25 will get you a tortilla with a choice of 3 items including one of many meat options ranging from chipotle and mole chicken to chorizo/potatoes. 
You can argue that the meat can be a bit more fresh/tasty but you can't really argue for the price. 
Note the late hours during the weekend, and for a best bet get a bunch of tacos or taquitos and try all the different meats."}
{"text":"I'm gonna do that obnoxious thing where I say, \"Consider this a 3.5 star review!\" and then give it a four, because Yelp won't let me give an actual 3.5 star review.  I'd give this place a three, but I really want to give it a better review on a sheer numerical basis than El Trompo.

Because that's basically what this place is; El Trompo, but a bit better.  Both taquerias do humble street tacos fairly well, but Mexican Salsas lets you buy them one at a time so you can order whatever you want, as opposed to El Trompo's nonsensical system of roping you into buying five tacos of one bland variety.  This place is also kind of like a faux-Mexican Subway, so if you want to have authentic-styled street tacos with the meat of your choice plus cilantro and onion, you can have it, or if you want to be a giant Gringo you can throw on cheese and sour cream.  I appreciate different strokes for different folks.

Hence, four stars.  Kinda.

But yeah, unless you're married to the idea of simple street tacos, I'd implore you to go to Seven Lives around the corner and just eat mindblowing authentic SD / TJ tacos instead.  Seriously."}
{"text":"Popped by after reading a rave review in Eye Weekly that got me pumped for cheap tasty eats.

I wasn't disappointed. I went for the three tacos, veggie and steak, plus a can of yummy mango nectar. I also opted for the chipotle salsa which, lucky for me, wasn't overly spicy. It took a while for my food since they were pretty busy and only one lady was working the grill, so be prepared to wait more than a few minutes if everyone suddenly decides they want authentic Mexican. But once my food did come up, oh man was it tasty. Washing it down with the mango nectar, I was more than satisfied, all for under $10!"}
{"text":"Nothing special here. I had the pork carnitas taco and a steak burrito both with the green salsa and all the toppings. The pork was dry and kind of cold, but the overall taste was okay. I did enjoy the burrito more, it tasted good and was a decent size, but was really watery, half way through I had a pool of juice on my plate? Much better  options in the same area."}
{"text":"Love this place. This is the closest thing I've come to authentic Mexican food in Toronto (never got to visit A&A). Most 'Mexican' places in Toronto are just Tex-Mex joints. When I want Mexican, I want tacos, not a damn burrito. 

It's no frills, but it's cheap, delicious and has friendly service. I always get the three double taco deal - you get 6 soft tacos with the fillings of your choice for around $7. It's super filling, and delicious. I personally always get them with tinga, beans, and green salsa, but you can get different toppings on all three if you like. If you're craving some good tacos, definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"What a welcome addition to Kensington Market.  This somewhat new eatery offers fast meals at reasonable prices.  I love their vegetarian burrito at $4.99!  You can have it w/ or w/out cheese, and with your choice of a potato based or tofu/cactus filling.  (correct me if I'm wrong about the fillings!)  I read what others typed about its authenticity... for me, the fact that everytime I've gone there, I've always been serviced by people who speak English with a Spanish accent...  You can't go wrong by coming here for a meal.
A close friend of mine really enjoys the shredded pork filling.

Be very careful about the Hot sauce.  Mild and Medium are fine, but there was a woman eating near us who kept asking for water and tearing up...  Let's just say that she regretted getting the \"hot\" sauce."}
