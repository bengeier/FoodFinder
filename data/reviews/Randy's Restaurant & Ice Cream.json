{"text":"Love their breakfast! Waffles are just like home cooked. If you need breakfast in a hurry this is the place, with in 5 mins of ordering your food is at the table."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a decade and a half, since I was 5, and it has been my absolute favorite restaurant my whole life.

I only get the spaghetti though. So I can only attest to its greatness. Many stories through the years of only ordering spaghetti (regardless of the hour or occasion). 

Mrs. Randy always decorates the restaurant in seasonal and holiday themes and it makes me giggle. It is very cute, especially with all the old folks who fit in with the Hallmark style. And the 90s interior is fantastic. Yes please to salmon-pink, off-white, and turquoise. 

The service is always good. Lots of new servers still learning every time I have been lately. 

Randy man is a win."}
{"text":"There aren't many places around like Randy's... unfortunately.  I have been going there for 15 years now.  I put Randy's in the classic diner category.  It's good food at a very reasonable price.  They know their business.  If you want eggs, pancakes, bacon and sausage for $5, order Randy's breakfast.  It's there in about 5 minutes ON A BUSY DAY.  Consistency is what it takes to run a great restaurant and that's what they have.  Oh, and the blueberry pancakes are perfect.  Not too dry, not to mushy and loaded with blueberries. Hands down my favorite breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Super popular locals spot. Huge selection of items on the menu. Coffee is great, I like it black.  And the daily specials keep things fresh. Oh yeah the prices are right too"}
{"text":"My husband found the place on Yelp, so we took our 3 year old son for dinner at during the holiday break.  When we walked ina, wanted to hate it based on the decor alone.....
However, that being said,  the waitress treated our son like a king, the milkshakes were amazing, and the food pretty much tasted like mom used to make.... Simple but good....The chicken noodle soup tasted like homemade and the burgers were tasty.

No complaints... Decent food and excellent service.  No wonder this place has been around so long."}
{"text":"Whenever I want to eat breakfast out, I've been coming here for 20 years. It is the definition of the art. \"Cash only\" is kinda weird, but just plan accordingly. 
This morning I had an $8 omlette meal special and asked for a waffle in addition. The waffle was priced at $5.50... is that normal for a waffle? Seems steep. 
Nonetheless it remains my breakfast place of choice."}
{"text":"This place has a huge number of affordable items for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  It feels very homey and it's affordable. (Usually spend around $7 or $8 on a meal).  They also have the quickest turn around time for ordering either in the restaurant or when ordering takeout.  

They are cash/checks only but that's fine because the shopping center they are in has a chase bank and a Wells Fargo inside of Safeway, so getting cash shouldn't be a problem for most. 

Randys big breakfast never disappoints or home made corn beef and hash is delicious.  Every person from either out of town or locals who I have taken absolutely loves it."}
{"text":"Sooooo sad.....how can you sell chicken noodle soup without chicken or noodles???  Should have just called it chicken water and cut my cost in half.  Had the beef/barley soup last week and it was awesome........I just don't get it???  Will have to think twice b/f trying for a third visit.   :("}
{"text":"Randy's restaurant is always a great experience. I have been going there all my life and it is just fantastic. Great food, great service, you can't go wrong! Their portions are great and for a reasonable price. I always look forward to going there!"}
{"text":"The food was okay. We both ordered buffalo chicken wraps.  The wraps had blue cheese and ranch in them, which made it taste a little weird and the blue cheese was overpowering.  If we return, we will definitely try something else instead.  Our waitress had a huge attitude and neither of us knew why.  Decent prices, but cash or checks only.  (Who accepts checks anymore but not cards?)"}
{"text":"Ok love, love this place. First time I have ever gone anywhere and when ready to leave was asked did I want to go cups for drinks. We said yes and the waitress got them for us. Iced tea, coffee and soda. The food is great, service great, biscuits and gravy still not as good as Brass Rail. Even on a Sunday right at lunch did not have to wait. WIll go back as often as I can afford the drive and the meal."}
{"text":"A classic diner. A large selection of food at cheap prices. I've been here twice and happy with my breakfast each time. If you are looking for a local old faithful breakfast spot... Randy's is the place."}
{"text":"Just had wonderful breakfast on Randy's Patio. Waitress brought our Westie a bowl of water & breakfast served quickly. I had the corned beef hash which was homemade with real cornbeef not the usual canned corn beef. Debbie, our waitress, is the best - very helpful & cheerful!"}
{"text":"My favorite review was Susan M. from 12/9 - laughed out loud! This lady needs to eat only at home.  Anyway, I have always enjoyed Randy's, but my favorite thing is their pies.  Hard to find a restaurant in any price range that offers pie for dessert, especially home made!  Sometimes I stop by just for pie and coffee - a real treat."}
{"text":"Good place  lots ofolder folks hear. Bring food to tyou really fast. Friendly, community oriented."}
{"text":"Oh Randy's! I have lived next to you for the past two years, and am kicking myself for not stopping in sooner.

Living in Old Town, we are lucky to be surrounded by many local, unique places for a bite to eat. Normally on a weekend morning we'd venture to The Good Egg, the Breakfast Club or the Pancake House. A few months back we decided to stop by Randy's, and we are SO happy we did.

First, it is a no frills type of place. Lots of seating, the food comes out quick, the menu is basic, and it's a cash only place. Everyone that works there is busy, but friendly. The food is good, basic and filling. The prices are fantastic for the value you get. We typically come for breakfast, but this past weekend we enjoyed a delicious late lunch, and even stopped by later that evening on a bike ride for a scoop of ice cream.

I love going to Randy's, I like the food, like the people, like how normal it is. Two thumbs up :)."}
{"text":"I love this place. Cheap food, good quality that's filling, and fast service. Prefer this for breakfast over most famous breakfast joints in town"}
{"text":"Randy's is a longtime local Scottsdale business with fast, fast, fast service and decent short-order cook style breakfast, lunch and dinner. I like that there is an extensive menu but the charm is that you can just tell the waitress what you want and they can produce it for you in less than a minute. Small town feel in a big city with a fast-food restaurant order elegance. If you don't like to cook your own scrambled eggs, this is a good option for you. I wouldn't expect any fancy omelets or ingredients and presentation is unnecessary (it would just slow the food down which comes out very quickly). 

I was turned off by the hostess that can't say hi while taking your name. I know its busy and the service is fast, fast, fast (they are fast) but say Hi and Good Morning, its just polite. Remember, small town feel, big city? 

I don't like sitting down when the tip is still on the table from the last guest. I know that I am not the only person going to sit at that table but it feels like the table didn't get a good break between guests. The table was wiped clean but still, make it feel like it is ready for a new customer. I also found a hair in my food, an eyelash. I think it could have been mine, yes, I am going to say it's mine, probably fell out when I blinked after I ordered and my food arrived. Too bad, I don't eat as fast because it was obvious that we needed to get out, out, out for the next customer."}
{"text":"I go by this restaurant every time I have to go to the bank and it always seems busy. I decided to stop in and have lunch on my way to the bank. The selection was good and they have a good number of specials. I had the Monday spacial which was a chicken fiesta salad. It was $7.50 and the portion size was average. It was OK but i was still hungry. So I ordered a cup of chili. It also was average , but It was served a little on the cool side and the sour cream I asked for was $.50 extra. I thought $3.00 for a cup of chili was a bit much. The service was good and the wait time for the food was also good. From reading the reviews from other Yelpers I expected to see the cast of Cocoon having lunch here. It wasn't that bad, although I thought I did see a couple of them around the room."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Randy's!  They have been there for as long as I can remember and I have been going there since I was little.  I love their breakfast.  It is the fastest, best, and cheapest in town.  You get a ton of food for the price and the employees are great as well.  i would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We have loved this place for 20, years .. I like to start out with my Pie..cause its the 'best Darn pie in the Paco's...
Everything is made from scratch and you can't beat the prices... ln today's over priced processed food Industry...It is very refreshing to see and experience.."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Here on vacation and love how everyone here was friendly. Breakfast was hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this classic diner. It is cash only so be aware of that but everything on the menu is phenomenal and comes out fast. Wait staff is always fast and attentive."}
{"text":"Really great food and service, overall exceptional experience! Just tried breakfast for the first time (dinner previous two visits) and very delicious! Blueberry pancakes and bacon and eggs and sausage, hard to beat for under $15 with drinks included. Will be back again and again"}
{"text":"They need to NOT give the check when I literally just got my food !!!!!! It ruins my whole meal , they act like we're not going to pay for our food. Its very rude ,I think. I would really appreciate if they stop doing this. Everything else is good ."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast with fast service.  We were there on a busy Sunday morning for brunch and were seated in about 10 min. even tho it seemed like a big crowd was waiting. They are very efficient in the kitchen so your food comes out quickly, shortly after you order.  Good food, fast friendly service. Nothing fancy, but their homemade pies looked great."}
{"text":"Very friendly lunch spot. Employees really enjoy their job here.  We could tell that there was many regulars (people) here staff was wonderful. Food was great- even friends agreed.  We will be back again.  Very clean, love it. We will get ice cream next time, when we have more time to hang out.  Very relaxing."}
{"text":"I always feel bad writing a bad review especially for a place with such nice servers, but the food was terrible. I love diners, and was looking to Randy's for a little Monday night pick-me-up. I ordered their Monday night turkey dinner special, a diner classic. What I got was a plate of canned food. Canned yams, canned green beans, canned cranberry sauce, and two dry turkey slices with canned gravy. I was hoping a nice slice of pie would make up for my already upset stomach. Nope! They brought me a disgusting slice of factory made, slimy apple pie. Worst of all it wasn't cheap in the least. Two dinners with two sodas cost $33. I feel totally let down, and bummed that I wasted so much money. Maybe their breakfast is better? Too bad I won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"I love going to Randy's for breakfast. Just last week, when old friends from college came to town, I took them to Randy's. Its a great place to stop and talk and the foods great too. I judge my breakfast stops by their chicken fried steak and eggs and Randy's has one of the best out there. The service is always fast and friendly. I love that I can sit back and enjoy my breakfast with out the feeling of being rushed. I like to share my favorite places in Facebook and Randy's a hit with me. I also think that you should add green chiles to more of your breakfast dishes. Yum!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times now and have been extremely pleased with everything I have ever ordered.  The corned beef and cabbage is amazing and you can not go wrong with the homemade pies!"}
{"text":"I love Randy's!  I grew up in the Midwest and places like this are plentiful.  Here in the valley, especially Scottsdale, have few options for home style food at affordable prices.  I've never had a bad meal here and the pie is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Ever since my daughter went gluten-free we've been searching for the perfect spot for our traditional after-church family breakfast. We found it at Randy's!

From the moment we walked in the door the service was impeccable. Our first visit was on St Patricks Day and the place was packed. That did not hinder their customer service one bit. Everyone was cheerful and helpful and it had a fun, \"everyone knows your name\" atmosphere.

Once we were seated our server took our drink order right away and returned with our drinks before we could even decide what we were going to eat. She remained this attentive the entire time.

Now, I am a bit of a blueberry pancake snob and like my pancakes just right- soft and chewy, not too thick or bread-like. Randy's aces the test! Yummy! 

As for value, you definitely get your monies worth. Their omelettes come with toast and potatoes but you can upgrade the toast to pancakes, which we did since we like to share. The kids meals are all of $4.25 and include drinks so you're not paying an arm and a leg for your kids to have juice with their meal.  Our total bill for 5 people was around $34 - very reasonable.

Did I mention that they have fresh brewed passion fruit iced tea? It sounds silly but I am also a tea snob and was giddy when I found great service and great food plus my favorite tea, all in the same place.

Overall Randy's is a great place for a family meal. We can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"If it's Corned Beef and Cabbage you like, Randy's on Thursday night is the place to go!!  I'm there at least twice a week. The food is good and there are planty of specials on the board every day.  Their soups are always great!   They now have gluten-free bread so I can actually get a sandwich again!  Best of all...the waitstaff are all wonderful, friendly and attentive.  They greet you like an old friend!  Great neighborhood place."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! The staff is very friendly and the food is good. They are very very fast on service! Our food came out less than 5 min after ordering. Just make sure you bring cash. They do have an ATM on site but who really wants to pay a service charge. We will be back for sure to try the pies!!!"}
{"text":"Great diner! Amazing prices! Reminds me of a place back home... we will be back. The milkshakes were awesome!!"}
{"text":"Takeout.  Dinner.  Good. Sliced beef dinner with salad and slice of pie."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here while riding our bikes through Scottsdale. We both enjoyed sitting outside and eating breakfast from their healthy menu. We had a hard time making up our minds because of the extensive menu, so we will be back! Remember that they do not take credit cards, but they do accept personal checks and there is a ATM in the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is now a regular for dinner for us at least once a week.  The specials change nightly and come with soup/salad and dessert - you will not find a better deal in town.   Your meal will come out in record time.  We have never been disappointed, pasta, sandwiches, fish, Mexican -  you name it they do a great job.  Service is awesome.  Check out facebook as well, as they do great deals on there too, like a free entree, if you show the server the facebook special page."}
{"text":"+-+-+- Reuben Sandwich +-+-+-+-+

Ugh ....... it wasn't layered slices of corned beef.
ONE THICK SLAB ....... 

The service was 5 stars.
Everyone was very very  friendly."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, decent food, reasonable prices. Was expecting homemade or soft serve ice cream but its just Dryers so we skipped that."}
{"text":"We were seated fast, food was served quickly. The staff worked as a team and all were very friendly and efficient. There were four in our party and everyone loved their food. We had the #2 breakfast, French toast, veggie eggs Beni, and more. This is a holiday morning so lots of people have the day off and some of the other restaurants are closed...so it could have been a long wait, but this place is well run. Plus you can have dogs on the patio area. What is not to love about this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and selections. A,little pricey  for dinners. Lunch prices much better. We ate here several times during  our  stay ."}
{"text":"We feel like family the second we walk in the door.  We are greeted by the owners and staff immediately with a smile and warm welcome.  The food is great home cooking and never a long wait.  That's why we've been visiting Randy's for over 20 years.  Thank you to everyone at Randy for so many great meals.  Our out of town relatives always want to go there first when they come visit.  Were looking forward to another 20 plus years of Randy meals."}
{"text":"Loved this place: fast friendly service, quick turnaround, great value for the money. The largely older clientele clearly knows a good deal when they see one--you could tell there were many regulars, and the staff were so great with everyone."}
{"text":"You know it's good when the check out lady at Walmart highly recommends it to two out of town locals. We decided to give it a go and were happily amazed. At first when we walked in we noticed that the decor could use an update, but the restaurant was packed with locals. We were quickly seated, given a minute to order, placed our order and literally within two minutes had our food. Amazing food at fast-food speed. This restaurant landed on our list of return venues."}
{"text":"Still the best buy west of the Mississippi. Service, price, food quality & variety...EXCELLENT. Nancy, my server, has the whole package, friendly, professional, efficient, knowledgeable, good conversationalist. An eight minute walk from where I live."}
{"text":"Fast service. It seems that they had it ready in the kitchen before we ordered it!!  The service was FAST friendly and Fast!  The food was ok.  Not expensive and food tasted fine. (I do not know how you can ruin a BLT!)
Good place to eat quick."}
{"text":"Randy's is a great place to eat! I had my kitchen redone and ended up eating there a bunch. Food is good service is amazing! It's an old school kind of place. Breakfast is great!
Bring cash $$$$ as no credit cards!"}
{"text":"You need to visit Randy's restaurant if visiting Scottsdale. I had the Benedict with spinach. The best part is that you can get a dessert as one of the side dishes included with a meal. There is a real diner feel with blue plate specials. There is no credit cards accepted so don't forget your cash!"}
{"text":"Three of us ordered their breakfast special today. My husband couldn't finish his biscuits and gray that came with eggs, etc. Biscuits were so hard he couldn't finish it. I had the California omelet with potatoes. It was ok. Didn't finish it. For some reason, the food there isn't as well prepared as it use to be years ago. You can tell they have cut corners. I ordered calves liver and onions a few years ago. I make this myself. It was the worse I ever had. I'm a good cook and know the difference. Will be going else where from now on. But, I must give the personnel a big thumbs up as they are the best at welcoming and serving you."}
{"text":"Great diner that serves up some tasty breakfast and lunch.  Service is generally good and they only take cash! 
Great prices and good food."}
{"text":"Our first visit was memorable and enjoyable. Our server Debbie treated us with gusto; the service was very speedy; the food was delicious and affordable. We will return even the location is not on our flight path."}
{"text":"I have been to Randy's multiple times. I've never had a bad meal be it breakfast, lunch or dinner. It doesn't seem to matter what waitress you have, they all are so friendly. Prices are reasonable. Real small town dinner atmosphere. The crowd is older but what's wrong with that. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Another great breakfast. Consistently fast to serve and always topping off your coffee or other drinks. Today the 2 egg special, sunny side up, with bacon, sausage, rye toast and home fries cooked in bacon fat was delicious. 

They are cash only but there is an ATM on site if necessary.  If you get a counter seat, expect your meal unless than 3 minutes as service there is lightning fast. The servers and all staff have always been friendly and willing to serve with a smile."}
{"text":"We stopped by for pie and it was well worth it! Peach pie warm with ice cream. Rhubarb pie warm with ice cream. Both heavenly! The bread pudding that my sister ordered was average...I wouldn't recommend it. And remember: they do not accept credit cards so have cash handy! PS I looked over the extensive menu and the variety of egg's benedicts they have is incredible. I think my husband and I will be back for breakfast for sure!"}
{"text":"How have I not been here sooner! Okay okay I'll admit it... I was a little scared to try this place. The long line and full parking lot every time I drove by helped me convince the hubby to give it a shot. 

It's his \"new favorite breakfast place\". The vibe is similar to a cheers bar. I feel like if I came here often enough everyone would really know my name. Great family owed vibe and the staff was all super friendly and on top of there game!! 

The food came out super fast and was DELICIOUS!! I was sooo shocked at the quality of the food we received. You can tell it was fresh and the portions were larger than expected! The low prices is definitely another perk! 

Even though they were jam packed we received awesome service and were not disappointed whatsoever!! 

We will without a doubt make this a new spot of ours and you should too!"}
{"text":"Like others have said great local place fast and efficient food with no wait at a great price. Light and healthy choices for breakfast and the hash browns are old school good. Biscuits and gravy were average as well as the pancakes. Cash only is a bit hard to swallow."}
{"text":"Randy's is our go-to restaurant after church, or when we want to have just really good home cooking food, a welcoming atmosphere, and great waiters.  We don't need to be impressed, we just want to relax.  You will be welcomed, and the prices will lure you back!  Just remember to bring cash- hey, with these prices you won't mind."}
{"text":"Just had lunch with my boyfriend here after hiking Cholla trails and it was a great choice! Went on a Saturday afternoon around 1230, the place was full of people but we didn't have to wait for a table. It is a cute little family, mom and pop type of restaurant. The food was really good and the service was wonderful. Our waitress was very kind, attentive and accomodating. I asked if she could substitute a wrap for the bun on the spicy chipotle bean veggie patty and after she was able to do that for me she continued to ask if I was happy with my choice in a sincere and sweet way. She continued to check on us and not in an annoying over attentive way. All the interactions we encountered were friendly and generous. This was our first time here since we are just visiting AZ on vacation and we really enjoyed our dining experience here. Good food for the prices and great service. Another local restaurant we can add to our list of recommendations :) We didnt get dessert, but if we are able to come back before the trip is over we will be back for some."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!  Closest thing you can get to a real diner in AZ. Delicious food, super fast service and great prices."}
{"text":"Ate here at randys last night & sat on the patio, it was just the right amount of food & it included a scoop of yummy ice cream, can't beat that!!! Back today to try the lunch menu, food just came out in record time, gotta go eat now!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to a neighborhood very near Randy's in June. Randy's was my go to place for breakfast 2-3 times a week until a week ago. The food is good quality diner food, prices are reasonable, and the wait staff very friendly. What's not to like you ask? I went to breakfast last week with my mother-- our weekend ritual.  I ordered the farm skillet and asked the waiter to tell the chef I was very sensitive to onion and to please try not to accidentally mix onion in my skillet. The reason I made the request is on two prior occasions having ordered the mini omelet, onion was mixed in with the other ingredients I had requested. On those occasions, I did not send back the food, I chalked it up to my not in the first instance explaining I can not eat onion. Thereafter, on every occasion, I made a special request to ensure there was no onion. This strategy worked well for several months. Until last week. Upon receiving my skillet, I took two bites and bit into an onion. When the waiter stopped by our table, I told him I was sorry I could not eat the order as I had just bit into an onion. I did not feel bad sending the order back as I had expressly asked for no onion upon ordering. The waiter said he would have to talk to Randy the owner about this. I said OK. After a few minutes Randy came over to the table with a new skillet meal. I thanked him. Randy then proceeded with the following: \"I personally asked them to cook the meal separate the first time. I had to throw out your meal. WHEN WE SAY THERE ARE NO ONIONS IN SOMETHING, THERE ARE NO ONIONS! I WILL NOT DO THIS AGAIN. CONSIDER THIS YOUR WARNING!\" Randy was red in the face and extremely angry. Needless to say, both my mother and I were shocked by this reaction. I frankly was so taken aback I didn't say anything in response. We ate our meal and afterwards commented that his behavior was so rude we could never go back again. In thinking about what Randy said about cooking the meal separate, I can only surmise he was talking about the grill, however, based on past experience, I believe what is happening is the onions are next to either the container of cheese, mushroom or tomato as these are the other ingredients I have ordered in the past and in the course of getting these other ingredients out, the onions have inadvertently been mixed in. Anyway, if you have an allergy or aversion to onions, or do not wish to be treated in such an abrasive manner by the owner,  you may wish not to frequent this establishment."}
{"text":"Very unique..... felt like I was in small town USA, considering the interior featured shiny pink booths, flashy 80s decor, and patrons wearing \"Grandmas Gone Wild\" sweatshirts.  I had the evening special:  baked ham with scalloped potatoes and applesauce - tasted just like a good ol' fashioned home cooked meal.  The shake I had for dessert was gigantic, and my wife enjoyed her pumpkin pie.  Anxious to try their breakfast after reading the other reviews now.  Wish I'd have known about this place sooner as I'll be moving out of the area soon..."}
{"text":"Fastest service of any sit-down cafe/diner I have ever experienced. Friendly smiles greet you as you walk into this 'locals' joint. The breakfast portions are large, the prices are great and the food is excellent. My favorite is the Randy's Breakfast with Waffle and fresh strawberries w/ whip cream on top. Also a must try is the Banana Pancakes. You just can't beat this place for service, tastiness and price."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I love their Liver and Onions!! They make it just like my mom made it when I was little. Great comfort food!! I especially love the service!!! As soon as I walk in they know what my order is going to be. And the prices are wonderful! Great food, great service, great people!  You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I have only ordered breakfast items here. I can't help it. I love it. The menu is vast, at a great price and it will fill you up! The place can be quite busy on a weekend morning but the hostess seats fast. The kitchen staff is on point so you won't wait for long for your meal. The waitresses call regulars, which there are many, by name. RANDY'S ONLY ACCEPTS CASH but has an ATM by the door."}
{"text":"My first time here, even though I'd driven past the place a 100 times. Busy place! I heard they were always packed.
Stellar wait staff! Food was very good, but at least for me, the portion sizes are small. I had the Hi-Boy burger (reminded me of a Big Boy) with fries. Was very tasty. Size-wise it wasn't much bigger than a Big Mac. HUGE menu! Lots to chose from."}
{"text":"Really good food and amazing service! I didnt like the smell of the place though, but inspite of that it has a cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Breakfast with the folks. Ate here back in the day when they opened up and haven't thought of it since I moved back to Phoenix. Crowded yet great service for a Saturday or Sunday breakfast gathering. Staff is awesome and service with a smile. Great place!"}
{"text":"Nice clean neighborhood restaurant. Local flair, great menu of good food choices. Breakfasts are excellent... Servers friendly and super fast service."}
{"text":"Horrible experience eating breakfast there today, I ordered two poached eggs,  dry English muffin and  sliced avocado and a black coffee. the eggs I had to send back three times because they were under cooked, the English muffin was burnt and black and I had about a 1/4 sliced avocado very thing, the bill came corrected and it came t, three dollars for my Mother in laws slice of pie ( that was okay )  $2.22 for her soda, $2.50 for my coffee and $2.00 for 1/4 of thinly sliced avocado, a whole avocado in the grocery store cost $2.00- I will never eat at that place again. The service was okay but the food was horrible!o over $9.00 with tax,"}
{"text":"Very good service and the food is very good at a very good price! Had breakfast and it was a typical bacon and eggs meal, nothing exciting but not bad either! I would go again for breakfast for inviting staff!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to go for breakfast.  The offer really cheap meals and super fast service, even on Saturday and Sundays.  Be prepared to stand in line, and bring cash -- they don't accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Took me nearly three years to finally pull the trigger on a meal (breakfast) at this locals hangout near my place. Randy's can probably be described as the trailer trash (in a good way) cousin to other popular Scottsdale places like Butters and BC. The food came out with incredible speed and I'm talking no less than 6 minutes after ordering my short stack ($6) of blueberry pancakes arrived. These cakes were not that fluffy, but they did make up for that with a load of fresh blueberries stuffed inside. The coffee ($2) actually was the big winner as the refills kept coming and the brew was pretty good. 
   You wouldn't really wait here for breakfast, like other places in town, but they have very affordable prices and the omelettes looked good. Will be back to try a lunch item, but also be warned the counter seats are not that comfortable, so go for a solo booth."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. If they're busy, they are great at getting you seated in a timely manner. It could use a freshening. A good cleaning, some fresh paint and a carpet shampoo is in order. It has a bit of an aroma. They could upgrade to Heinz ketchup. They serve Hunts, which I do not enjoy. I'd prefer no ketchup to Hunts. The only cash/check thing is inconvenient in this day and age. Regardless, we love Randy's, and will continue to visit."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast spot with consistent fast and friendly service and delicious food! It's also a great deal!"}
{"text":"I hesitate to do this review, because you can't get into Randy's without a wait, especially during the \"season\". However, they have great breakfasts at very (as in cheap) prices, and everyone should know it!
Randy's doesn't accept credit or debit cards,which is a good business practice, I'd say. 
The food comes out so fast that you barely do your Yelp check-in, and voila! your food is at your table!
The dinners, in my opinion, are only so-so, but lunches and breakfasts are good, fast, and cheap!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! Best bacon &egg on an english muffin with cheese in town. Wait staff is always smiling...quick service even when packed....and it does get packed! Cash only.....ATM on site....."}
{"text":"Best diner in Scottsdale!  Family owned and operated. Good food great service and fast!  Been coming here for close to 20 years. Moved away for 5 years and had our first breakfast since moving back. Owner recognizes us immediately and greeted us with open arms! Can't ask more than that."}
{"text":"Been going here for years and never had anything less of a fantastic experience. Today I got the root beer float and a BLT sandwich. The staff is always checking up on you. They have sandwiches, salads, wraps, soups, and many varieties of ice cream, all of which are the best for miles."}
{"text":"I live right across the street and we love this place! Good food at great prices. Servers are very quick, friendly and attentive!! Food comes out extremely fast. Dogs are allowed on the patio and are given little doggie water bowls."}
{"text":"I love Randys! The food is always really good and really fast! Its cheap and everyone is very friendly. Its my go to breakfast spot. Only downfall is they only take cash so no plastic everyone!"}
{"text":"I have lived right next to the place for 5 years but never until today walked in. Went for brunch and had the meat loaf and the chicken fried steak. It was really good . The service was quick. But the best part was the server Debbie. She was sweet respectful entertaining and very patient. They really try to make the experience amazing. The only comment that may be negative is I found the meatloaf sauce a bit salty for my taste. It may be good for everyone else but I just found it a bit on saltier side. But my girlfriend didn't think so... so may be it's just me. Anyways it's a nice place for a bit if you are in old town area!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our dinner at Randy's, their hamburger are well cooked and well served. Enjoyed a delicious spinach salad as well.
The only reason I wouldn't go back is the smell inside the restaurant, not sure what it is but it's not pleasant while eating. It smells old, not well ventilated.
Be aware payment is cash or check !!!! Of course they have an ATM machine for your convenience so you have the extra charges and not the restaurant."}
{"text":"I love Randy's!  A neighborhood classic.  Good prices and even better food.  My wife and I have eaten multiple meals here and were never disappointed.  We are typically one of the youngest in here when we go.  This is nice because there's not screaming kids or anything like that ruining our meal.  Try the pies!  My personal favorite is the peanut butter ice cream pie!"}
{"text":"Great food and very consistent with quality and taste! I place to go orders frequently and it is always ready fast and correct. Great food, great service, and cool atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I have hesitated before to give not so great reviews to places, especially when they seem to be a valley institution and they are family run, however the whole reason we use Yelp is to help us make decisions on where we want to spend our hard earned money.  When dealing with any situation that has both good and bad points I always take the bad first.  Here it goes:
Even though the staff was friendly I was giving only a spare few minutes to scan the menu before the waitress was back asking for my order.  I was a server for years and it is bad form to ask someone for their order while the menu is still open in their hand and it is obvious they are reading it.  When I asked for some more time, it was given to me but I felt it was somewhat reluctantly which lead to feeling more rushed.  So I rushed and ordered something so stupid and the moment my order was out of my mouth I regretted it, tacos.  I know, horrible!  I don't know what I was thinking, I was hungry, only a granola bar was eaten to satiate my hunger hours ago.
Taco Bell is better, these had very little meat, one was so scarce I wasn't sure if the meat was left off until I bit into it.  The meat iself left the tacos sitting in a pile of grease, gross.  The only toppings were a sprinkling of lettuce and smidge of cheese.  They brought tabasco to the table and when  I asked for tapatio or cholula I was brought sriracha.  Finally I got some hot sauce that I didn't recognize the name but it was spicy enough. The taco shells were store bought and stale, ugh.
Basically I thought I would write it off on a bad choice but the bottom line to me is if you have it on your menu it should be good.  I have hesitated in writing negative reviews for other places because I have decided for one reason or another to try it again before I review it.  Even though this place is cheap I know I won't go back there again, hence this review.
Oh yes, I also think it is pretty lame to have an establishment that size and this day and age  letting you pay cash only.  The ATM in the front charges a fee, I wonder who gets to pocket that fee?"}
{"text":"Great breakfasts
 Saturdays are quite busy and servers are top notch. Menu for old fashioned dinners like meatloaf, chicken, etc. Dinner specials daily. My new fave place to dine."}
{"text":"Very affordable. I came here for breakfast and found many of their choices to be under 10.00..they also have healthy alternative dishes as well. ..kind of feels like Dennys in here but cheaper. .the quality of food was good and service was awesome. ..I'll be back. ."}
{"text":"Phenomenal, cheap, fast hangover food.  This place totally reminds of a diner that you would see in a tiny little town where everyone knows each other.  The servers are friendly, there are lots of options for different egg substitutes, and the service is quick.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who woke up in a random apartment in Old Town, and needs some food quick!  One quick reminder though - be sure to bring your check book or cash!!  They do not take credit."}
{"text":"Oh, how I love this place. I was introduced to it a couple years ago when I moved to the Valley. And its certainly a go-to breakfast place. Its like they put your order in before you walk through the door. Faster than fast service every single time."}
{"text":"Pretty average food. Heard It was so great but no different than a Perkins or Village Inn."}
{"text":"Good food, Great price and friendly staff. One of my favorite restaurants  in the valley for a good comfort food/home cooked type of meal."}
{"text":"Randy's is a place we discovered when we moved to the Scottsdale neighborhood in 2010. Our furniture salesperson recommended it and are we glad he did. We sometimes end up there twice in one day! The staff knows us, we always get great service, and the food is healthy and freshly cooked. We love Randy's! We also take all of our out of town guests there when they land in Phoenix. It feels like home at Randy's!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for families and the older crowd.  Good food, very nice employees, nice variety and reasonably priced.  It is cash only so be prepared, they do have an ATM.  Breakfast is awesome, the entire menu is huge so you have lots of options and can get great, home style, comfort food."}
{"text":"I'm glad that I finally got to try out this diner. Randy's has been around since the 1980's and it definitely has that classic diner atmosphere. On my first visit I wanted to try a few different things so I ordered the half sandwich combo with grilled turkey, coleslaw, and a scoop of ice cream. I thought everything was great and what was even better was the service here which is just incredible. All the servers and waitresses were extremely friendly and nice. It looks like a lot of people that dine in here are seniors and you could tell that at least some of them are regulars here. I can see why they choose to come back as they're treated with great care.

This place is cash only and I noticed that they also do take out as well. I'll probably be back here soon to try out some of their other options on the rather extensive menu. Their daily specials look great too."}
{"text":"Visited while on vacation in the area, was not impressed.  Staff were somewhat pleasant but the place was pretty run down, ice cream was poor quality and everything was extra.  Purchased a couple of cups of ice cream which were served up, but when i asked about toppings, i was told, in no uncertain terms, adding toppings makes your cups of ice cream a 'sundae' and we have to charge more. We left with the 2 cups and was not particularly impressed with the quality of the contents.  I wont be back during this trip."}
{"text":"awesome neighborhood diner - super fast service and cheap food.  nothing fancy -they keep it real."}
{"text":"While living in Scottsdale and then recently visiting, Randy's is a staple. The oatmeal at breakfast is beyond divine, no quick oats here, slow cooked until thick creamy and heavenly. 
The menus are varied and offer great value for the money, large portions, daily specials, divine ice cream and sorbets,a favorite for locals and smart visitors who want to go where the locals go. 

You can eat in the porch, depending in your weather tolerance. The heat never bothered us but you had a cheerful A/C  cooled interior if you wished. Can get busy! Never a long wait, and well worth  it. 
This might be considered a diner, but its a diner where the locals keep going year after year. Not fancy, not haute cuisine, just a cheerful restaurant with delicious food! Comfort food! And plenty of it."}
{"text":"Food was ok, nothing great. Food network would say it needs salt. Worst thing was that they are cash only. Who does that anymore? Even the old lady behind me was digging for quarters."}
{"text":"Ive been going to Randy's for years, ever since they were at the old place which is now a Safeway.   Needless to say I've had just about everything on their menu. Randy's used to be a reasonably priced restraunt with great food, but it has slowly turned into an over priced restraunt with smaller and smaller portions.  Breakfast is still a pretty good buy, but lunch and dinner are simply not.  I just came from Randy's and had the buffalo chicken salad like I have so many other times.  The salad was $8 and looked like an oversized side salad.  I have noticed this very same thing on many of there other meals.  I ve probably have had my last dinner at Randy's tonight but I may make another breakfast trip.  To end on a good note the servers are usually the best!"}
{"text":"It's not hip, it's not cool, it's not trendy.   it's just decent food at REALLY decent prices, and that's why it's always packed.  
my grandmother lives right around the corner and loves to come here.  she loves the camaraderie (her word) between staff and regular customers (there are many.)  she loves the liver and insists that they use only the highest quality, \"otherwise it wouldn't taste very good.\"  I won't touch liver so I'll take her word for it.  
the BF and i took her here for brunch yesterday and i was delighted that the three of us could get decent, simple, fast breakfasts with coffee for $20 total.  it wasn't fantastic, it wasn't super savory, but it was good and it made my Granny Franny happy.  can't ask for anything else!"}
{"text":"Fast, good service. Basic food, but always delicious! Classic diner. Portions aren't enormous, so my boyfriend often orders two meals. And not the healthiest of choices. And AFFORDABLE!"}
{"text":"What a great place.  Cash only folks, so be warned!  They do have an ATM at the front but you will have to pay the fee.

The food is terrific, and ranges from sandwiches to meatloaf dinners to Mexican food.  They also do a killer breakfast.  They have daily specials and they make pies fresh daily."}
{"text":"Family and I have been coming for breakfast since I can remember. Awesome service, awesome food and a family friendly atmosphere!  The only drawback is that they're cash only. Homemade pies and amazing ice cream creations are their signature."}
{"text":"Uh, the staff?? Amazingly nice people who value their work.  Oh, and the food is BOMB"}
{"text":"A really good diner with tasty food and fast friendly service. Debbie was my server, she's lovely and smiley.

My first time here I had the Sedona Salad which was really fresh and tasty. This trip I had the breakfast sandwich which was really good and very inexpensive. 

Worth noting: I dine alone fairly often. I said that I'd sit at the counter, but they offered me a booth. Nice touch! Most restaurants want to reserve larger tables for people that haven't even walked in the door. So nice to be treated as an important customer even though I'm by myself!

Important! Cash and Checks only!"}
{"text":"First time here, it was fairly busy. We were sat quickly, and the server was super fast and friendly. She brought our drinks out quick and took our order right away. The food came out in literally 5-6 minutes. It was so good and hot! It was a nice experience. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great little diner. I got the Hiboy Burger with sweet potato fries and it was amazing. They use a good quality beef that doesn't shrink down a lot after they cook it. Sweet potato fries were nice and crispy."}
{"text":"I'm a food critic journalist In tour in the USA from Italy for a book I'm writing about the culinary experiences around the world.
I only have one thing to say about this unfortunate accident that forced me to meet somebody in this disgusting place.
Who was the criminal that put the word restaurant to this pile of junk??"}
{"text":"In a strip mall so plenty of parking. While I waited for my friend customers were very friendly and praised the food. Hostess was friendly seated us in a booth, gave us menus. Then our server came took our order, I noticed she was a little off. Food came out quickly, exactly as ordered and hot. When I finished my meal server or busboy did not want to remove my dishes. Walked by me 4 times. Did not offer refill on   my drink which was offered to my friend as well as a to go cup. How do I tell my friend, who is European-American, this is not a place where I am welcomed?"}
{"text":"This place is the best for breakfast. They are fast and friendly. Try there chorizo and eggs plate it comes with potatoes and beans or try there Mexican skillet. They have the best homemade chunky salsa. This place has been in business for years, definitely my favorite pace to eat when I am in a hurry and want good breakfast."}
{"text":"It was February 10, decades ago and I was just getting out of Phoenix Baptist Hospital after being diagnosed with a degenerative kidney disease.

My parents were staying at a nearby hotel, ready to take me back home. Not because of my ailment, but because of my involvement with that \"woman.\"

As soon as I got to my apartment, I found my things all packed up, and my parents about to lecture me on my future, and how it needs to be preserved for both mine and my family's benefit. They didn't want anything or anyone causing any embarrassment and tarnishing their good name.

I asserted my desire to continue seeing this \"woman.\" They threatened to take everything away. I left car keys, safe deposit box key, and apartment key and walked out the door - and I never once looked back as to what could've become of my life.

The next day (Feb 11), my wife picked up her $120+ paycheck (which was all the money we had in the world at that time), and we drove to the Mesa Wedding Chapel and spent $100 getting married. I had to borrow a 1967 Chevy Malibu to get there from the only friend that I had that didn't think I was insane to marry her.

There was no one else in attendance, except for us, the minister, and the cheesy organist. But, that is all whom we needed. I felt at that time that even though I had lost everything (inheritance, apt, school, Amex CC, weekly stipend, car, clothes, family, friends, etc); I actually gained everything!

We ate at the only place we could afford - Swensen's Ice Cream Parlor around 40th st and Thomas. That was our wedding reception and lunch / dinner.

Fast Forward decades later, and we've been married all this time, put 3 kids through college and 1 finishing up in another year. I've been part of 3 startups, and working on my 4th. We've started our Non-Profit, and have benefited so many people all these years that we have lost count of the Thank You's. 

We started with nothing and no one to cheer us on. In fact, except for 1 person, everyone said we would fair miserably. Hence, my zero lack of care for any detractors and naysayers - personae non grata as far as I am concerned. I won't even validate these people with a response.

Now, we eat out 7 days a week, most weeks, and we can dine anywhere we please.

So, why are we eating at this cheap diner on our anniversary?

Because, it's one of the few remaining Ice Cream Parlor, and it seemed like such a nice diner. Having read all the reviews. We also wanted a reminder of where we came from, and to never ever take our meals and servers for granted.

When we arrived, we were greeted by the friendliest of people. The place is clean, well lit, and it was bustling with activity. We were promptly seated, and warmly greeted by our server. She was new there, and was a little awkward. We assuaged her apprehension by injecting humor In our interactions.

We promised ourselves that we would order from a nostalgic perspective. So we ordered sandwiches, which was all that we could afford on our wedding day. My wife ordered the Grilled Turkey and Cheese Sandwich, and I had a Cheeseburger.

Nothing spectacular, but it was acceptable by diner standards. 

We also ordered Ice Cream. My wife had the Denver Mint, and I had the Continental Divide. Both were quite good.

One thing that we did appreciate about eating at this place was that we were surrounded by patrons who were primarily Seniors. Each table around us had married couples in the latter years of their life that simply enjoyed each other's company. It was very special and we were quite honored to be in their presence. They weren't the cranky old couples, but the fun couples that still enjoyed each other's company and didn't spend the whole time complaining about their food or each other. It was just great to see this on our anniversary. 

And when we were all done, we were quite surprised how inexpensive the meal was. If you are looking for a great diner, with a great atmosphere, good food, low prices, and great personal service, this is definitely the place!

Speaking of great service, we graciously thanked our waitress and gave her a tip that was much greater than 100% of the bill. We wanted to let her know that she deserved it, and that she did a great job. She couldn't stop thanking us, even as we were nearly out the door.

It is just a wonderful dining establishment, tucked in a neighborhood in Scottsdale. What a gem of a find this was, courtesy of avid Yelpers!

And speaking of Thank You's, I thanked my wife for being such wonderful dinner company all these decades, and for loving me through the best and worst of times.

She joked about being a cheap date. I corrected her, stating that she is an expensive one because after the first date, I was ready to give up my future, my inheritance, my family and friends just to be with her for the rest of our lives!

I have had no regrets about my life's choices nor dining here @ Randy's on our anniversary!"}
{"text":"I came here during the Thanksgiving holiday to visit my family. My step dad explained that he and his family had been coming here for years and it's really good diner food also known for their pies.

The restaurant doesn't look like it's ever been renovated..very pink and 60s vibes. But it wasn't a bad thing, it totally added to the vibe of a truly classic diner. We were seated immediately and chose to dine on the patio since I had my small dog with me. The waiters were friendly and made suggestions on what to eat.

I had the buffalo chicken wrap with French fries. It was very tasty, I think stuffed with blue cheese and lettuce and tomato. 

My fiancé had the messy burger on sourdough. It was really good but not messy at all.

My stepdad had the chicken salad sandwich on croissant. It looked bomb.

In addition to the yummy food and great service, I was impressed by how reasonably priced everything was. Much less expensive than anything you could get in LA for that quality. If I lived in Scottsdale id be there all the time!"}
{"text":"Vary good food for price. The wife and I love this place been going here for a very long time. Never left disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious corn beef hash eggs done perfect ,service excellent wife had huevos rancheros says it was very good as well"}
{"text":"I visited Scottdale with the kids---was very happy initially to find a place that was easy on the wallet.  But then I ordered the Corn Beef Hash (recommended by the waittress), and WOW---that was just a wonderful experience that I will definitely revisit next time I'm in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Heard the breakfast was good. Just ok. The hash browns were mushy inside. The sausage patty was smaller than the patty in a McDonald's baby burger. The staff was really nice and efficient. Won't be back, tho."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast food and selection. Fast/efficient and very good service on a very busy Sunday morning.  Cash only, which is a GREAT business decision for this type of restaurant. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place is the most disgusting place I have ever seen!!! Chefs don't wear gloves when handling the food. The servers also use their hands to move food around with no gloves. The food sits in the kitchens for hours on end before it is cooked. Never ever go here"}
{"text":"What a Pleasant surprise ,I remember this place from years ago when we lived in old town.thought it was a breakfast and lunch place,but they now serve dinner which is great and priced right."}
{"text":"So underrated it's crazy. Don't let the name fool you. Don't go there for the ice cream, go there for the food. While I have only had breakfast foods there, I have only had great experiences. I am a food snob- very picky! But I gotta tell you everything from the quality, service, and speediness-it's all on point! 

I am now a \"regular\" and I have my \"usual\" meal of western skillet sub the ham for crispy bacon with a sesame bagel butter on the side (that is if they don't run out of sesame!!) I call my order in and it is ready in 5 mins every time! Don't miss out on those potatoes they are amazing! For first timers I would suggest a skillet, the Randy's breakfast, or the hulk breakfast (part of their healthy menu options). 

It wouldn't be an honest review if I didn't say what I'm not a fan of: Skip out on the iced coffee and just order an iced tea- I am not only a food snob but a coffee addict as well! Also wish they had heaters for the outside seating. But for someone like me who can complain about everything, my list of downfalls for Randy's is really short!! 

Know that this place is old school- cash or check only. ATM machine inside in case you forget this. I love the people here so much I made them a cake for the holidays (along with my starbucks baristas!) If that doesn't tell you how nice they are, go see for yourself and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"It seems that Randy's has new management.  It is still fine, but the food quality has diminished.  Aren't they making enough money to accept credit cards?"}
{"text":"Fastest breakfast in town! In and out with a smile. I love this place, excellent menu and friendly staff that are always willing to offer accommodations. Old school diner feel and they are famous for their ice cream"}
{"text":"This cafe rocks! Excellent food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner
At CHEAP prices! Nightly dinner specials and the food is homemade!! FAST service run by one family."}
{"text":"Ok- gotta smile about this one. Stopped to get out of the heat and basically waste an hour between two appointments.
This is such a typical coffee shop I was thrown back to going out to lunch with my grandmother and her friends. I got such a kick out of the nostalgia.
Was seated by a pleasant lady and was immediately greeted by the server who returned with my iced tea quickly. I ordered the BLT w/avocado (in my world, a bad BLT can kill a coffee shop) I had a very nice choice of breads, and was asked if I wanted the mayo on the sandwich since the avo was on it. (Yes-Are you kidding?!lol)
I think that plate hit my table within THREE minutes, I kid you not. The French fries were SCREAMING HOT! (Fantastic!) Sandwich was very good with lots of filling and the bread was well toasted. Lots of checking back by my server, and refills of my glass. 
 The things that really dropped the score here were the approach to the restroom, which was covered with dirty trash on the floor, and the sticky vinyl seats. 
Small things but still significant.
I would go back, but maybe not dressed like I was, and just enjoy a true old style coffee shop."}
{"text":"Breakfast at Randy's is always delicious. Perfect over easy eggs, country potatoes, and half biscuit and gravy - with coffee is my fav breakfast. Debbie and other waitress's are friendly and always make me smile - a great way to start the day! I live in Chandler and enjoy eating breakfast at Randy's so much that I don't at all mind the early drive in to Scottsdale to eat my fav breakfast!  Chaparral park across the street is a great place to walk around the lake and enjoy the tranquil scenery and the ducks. Walk the lake at 6am - then head over and enjoy a great breakfast at Randy's to start your day!"}
{"text":"Very good place. We were all very happy with our selections and the pie was love at first site!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place!  Great food and prices!"}
{"text":"Always good food. Always friendly staff. Always fast delivery. Always my favorite. 
                                         OD"}
{"text":"Everyone I talked to loves this place, but I just really didn't, and I was surprised by that since I love \"from scratch\" diner type places.  We went on a Sunday after church and it was packed (20 min wait at 10:15). The place itself is locked in 1984 with lots of mauve and pink.  Our waitress was friendly but very harried.  We pretty much needed to ask each time for soda, coffee, or water refills.  The breakfast items are a bargain and it is hard to spend more than $10 on anything for breakfast.  The problem I had was with lunch items.  My Hot Mess burger was nicely grilled but lacked any real taste from the pepper jack or chipotle ranch dressing.  The Southwest salad was wet and overloaded with dressing and came with flavorless chicken.  If you go stick to breakfast or be prepared for a lack of taste."}
{"text":"fast and good. locally owned and operated. love the breakfast!  when the kids were younger it was perfect because the fresh waffle with a huge scope of ice cream arrived just in time"}
{"text":"This is one of our favourite places to come for breakfast while visiting Scottsdale. My family loves that we can come with our dog and sit outside with him.  It is an older crowd there, but very friendly. Very fast service and reasonably priced as well - a great neighbourhood diner.  Randy's has an extensive breakfast menu with just about anything you can think of - both healthy and indulgent options. We are big fans and will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Food was very good and it seemed like alot of local come here..There was an older gentlemen and the watress made sure he was well taken care of.  I got a veggie burger and my husband got the Roast Beef. Will return when we are back in scottsdale. Prices were also very good for the amount of food they served you."}
{"text":"Really great diner (remember, it's a diner - not fine dining).   Great food with the perfect proportions.  Lots of good menu items to choose from.  Everyone was very friendly and the service was pretty good."}
{"text":"So Good.

We were in Phoenix for a wedding and got a recommendation from our Lyft driver.  We were not disappointed.  The ambience is pure 1970's, with worn grey formica countertops and pink vinyl seats.  The waitresses are friendly and helpful.  Service is fast and cheap.  Several meal options for less than $5.  I got sausage and eggs, potatoes and toast for about $7.50.  

Our food arrived maybe 5 minutes from when we ordered it, cooked perfectly.  I finished it off with a delicious piece of apple pie ala mode.

Pay at the cashier like a breakfast place should be. No credit cards allowed."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite diner! Food was amazingly delicious, service was great and food came out within 5 minutes of ordering!
I've only been here for breakfast a few times but I highly recommend it!
It is a diner so don't expect a super-fancy-brunchy place. They also only take cash or checks. There is a ATM on site thought and a bank within walking distance!
My only regret is not finding this place sooner. I've lived in the area for 2.5 years and just found this gem within the past couple weeks!"}
{"text":"I really have to laugh at all the less-than-stellar reviews here. It's kinda funny how many people WRITE Yelp reviews, but do not bother to actually READ Yelp reviews BEFORE they eat somewhere. What kind of window lickers are these people? Come on folks! There really are no surprises at Randy's!!!

YES, Randy's is cash only. It's no secret, (it says so on the door, on the menu, and at the cash register. The fact that *YOU* failed to notice it is YOUR problem) and I'm sure it's done for good reasons. Whether or not you understand it, it is what it is. Deal with it or go somewhere else, sheesh. Quit crying already all you lousy whiners.

YES, Randy's is a favorite hang out for the older crowd. Get over it. It's decent food at a decent price, served quickly and with a smile. And yet you're \"offended\" that it attracts \"codgers\"? Really? You went there, what does that say about you?

NO, I would not ever recommend Randy's for their tacos, but quite honestly, if you go into a Mom and Pop Diner in Scottsdale and order TACOS (supposedly because you felt \"rushed\" and didn't know what else to order?!?) it is very clearly your own fault. Quit blaming other people for your own shortcomings. Next time, try the Cheeseburger with fries and coleslaw.  Better yet, go for breakfast and order just about anything...except Tacos."}
{"text":"Been going there since they opened; food is good, hot and comfortable with efficient friendly service. In and out quickly without feeling rushed or  like I just broke my budget.  I recommend it to everyone I run into."}
{"text":"This is our favorite family place for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Having moved from 40th Street Cafe in North Phoenix, this place was everything I had hoped it would be.  The waitstaff could be members of your own family and always make our little 15 month old smile.  The price for what you get is amazing and they have wonderful seasonal specials (try the pumpkin grain cakes, YUMMY!).  The service may be quick, but the food is quick too and the menu can be described in two words.  Comfort food.  If you're looking for a low cost, highly delicious mom & pop restaurant where you'd swear your mom was in the kitchen I'd check this place out.  Just remember.  They only accept cash or check.  Don't plan to pay with plastic."}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood place for breakfast when I don't want a 30-minute wait for a table, a 30-minute wait for my food, and a $30 bill.

We had the longest wait ever on a Sunday at noon, and it was still only about 10 minutes.  Usually, your breakfast comes so fast you think Samantha Stephens must be in the kitchen.  Nothing special on the menu-typical diner fare but always hot and tasty.  Lunch and dinner aren't bad either.  Great prices.  I always have Randy's breakfast which is 2 eggs, 2 bacon strips, 2 sausage links, and 2 pancakes for $4.65, I think.  Servers have always been attentive as well.

It is true the place is packed with seniors who are inevitably standing in the middle of the walkways talking to their neighbors about Depends or the stock market or whatever else they talk about.  And Randy's doesn't take plastic-I don't mind since it's so cheap.  They did just put an ATM in the lobby and they also take checks."}
{"text":"Where to begin. How many times have I driven by Randy's over the years? Maybe 100 or probably even more? Every time I drive by, I look in and see crowds enjoying themselves; especially around 4:30 for the early bird special. But can you blame a place located in the heart of old town for having some retirees on their list of regulars? I can't. In fact, I applaud Randy's. Apparently the old timers know what's up. 

Let me be truthful here. Randy's is just a diner. It's your everyday, run of the mill, All American neighborhood diner...and it's awesome. Walking in on a Saturday morning at 9:30, the place was jam packed with folks of all ages. The staff quickly greeted us and scurried us to an open table while keeping a smile on their face. Looking around, guests looked like they were having a good time. Whether it was the group of partiers who needed some grease to settle their hangover or the retirees on the run from Sun City andd taking a morning walk to get breakfast and coffee, I saw just about every type of person at Randy's. 

Now let me get to the menu. I am pretty sure that not a thing on the breakfast menu exceeds $6.00. Slowly but surely, Scottsdale's losing this trait of economically priced meals so I salute Randy's for keeping the prices down. Now on to star number two in my book of Randy's cuisine. Do you ever go to a restaurant for breakfast and think...I'd really like an egg but I'm also craving a pancake or french toast, but I don't want nor do I need a full order of carbs. I do all the time. I love pancakes and I love french toast, but there's a rare occasion when I actually order that as my main entree for a meal. Enter Randy's. In their 20+ breakfast combination choices, they offer options like \"one egg, one piece of bacon, and a half order of french toast\" or the same but with a pancake instead. When I read this, my heart skipped a beat for Randy wherever he is. And let me also mention that this meal is around $4.50. Can't beat that! 

The food itself was just what the doctor ordered. It tasted homemade, with flavor and it was just the right amount of food. Now don't walk in expecting The Food Network to feature Randy's, but if you want a solid breakfast at a decent price, this is your spot. But buyer beware. They only accept cash or checks. Better bring some cash because if you are under the age of 60, I highly doubt you're walking around with a check book and if you lack both, you'll be slapped with a $3 ATM fee. That's nearly the price of the meal! 

So until next time Randy's. With a six (?) page menu chock full of everything imaginable in small town USA dining, I think I have my hands full getting through it!"}
{"text":"For the older generation Randy's is the Scottsdale hangout for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The snowbirds haven't arrived (no wonder since this summer has had more days over 110 than ever before) but it is still crowded with the locals.  On Friday nights the popular fare is chicken and dumpling which includes salad or soup, coffee or tea and an ice cream dessert.  If you order a la carte you save a couple of bucks. If you skip the dumplings you get more chicken.  In general the food is bland so one needs to add lots of pepper. It may not sound like an exciting way to spend Friday night but if one leaves early one can work out at the gym to avoid the oppressive heat."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Scottsdale!  Fast and friendly service in this family owned restaurant that never fails to please.   Also love to visit for homemade pie!!!  Thank you for feeding Scottsdale for over 30 years!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding all around restaurant in Scottsdale. Great daily specials and everything on the menu is excellent!  I especially like the lamb shank on Thursdays."}
{"text":"Fabulous place for Breakfast or Lunch. Great service excellent cooks and management is top notch. Randy and his family know how to run a Restaurant. And they do a great business for like 40years. Very good food and prices."}
{"text":"Sad to say I probably won't be returning to Randy's for a while if at all and I love the food and the owners are great but they have a super rude server named Jackie and enough is enough. I've heard her be rude to other servers repeatedly and short with customers. She is so unprofessional...just the other day we were there and Traci was gonna seat us and Jackie snatched the menus from her and seated us elsewhere. We wanted Traci's section as she's always been great to us but again Jackie made that unprofessional and awkward. We've sat with Debbie and Jen and they are really great too but this Jackie lady is not pleasant. I don't like writing bad reviews but when someone is in customer service and acts this way I have to say something.
The food at Randy's is great and the service is fast which is good of course and the owners have always been super nice. Just know that If you go there don't sit anywhere near Jackie or at least try not to. Good luck."}
{"text":"Great food. Very fast service. Reasonable prices. And they also allow dogs on the patio! The 1/2 pound burger basket is worth the visit!"}
{"text":"This was an awful experience, the glasses were dirty, smell was wretched and it was just pure discussing. And what sort of astablishment does take credit or debit. Just awful"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great service!!!!!!!,been coming to Scottsdale for years. Very consistent, our go to place!!!!! Great breakfast,lunch and dinner.we recommend this place to all our friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best quick, easy, down home restaurant in Scottsdale. It makes me feel like I'm right back in North Dakota. 4 stars because the food is very basic even though the menu is insanely huge and also because they don't accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Randy's restaurant is family owned and operated by an incredible staff. They are fast and happy to be here.
We just had the most Devine waffle served got crispy just sweet enough.
. Their daily specials are always delicious as are soups and deserts.  You can't miss with any of the menu items"}
{"text":"Good food, great service, awesome selection and you couldn't really ask for more. Except no cards excepted.

Bring cash for this great diner."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in South Scottsdale.  Great prices and the servive is excellent."}
{"text":"This place is out-of-this-world outstanding.  Heads up though before I even proceed - no bar, no credit cards.  I have had a multitude of menu items, and continue to be impressed.  Salads are huge, and fresh; sandwiches are the same!  The breakfasts are second to none, and offers every breakfast item combination you could ever ask for.  The pies?  Boom!  Ice-cream?  Boom.  Bathrooms?  Boom-ish.  Service?  Seriously, everyone here loves their job.  This must be a huge testament to why Randy's has been around for so long in Scottsdale!  Here's the next \"tip\" - I don't know what type of \"chef magicians\" they have in the kitchen to make such wonderful dineresque dishes, but (1) it comes out ridiculously fast; and (2) HOT HOT HOT HOT!  If you've read any of my other reviews, you know I like food hot (that is supposed to be hot).  This place is an absolute historic gem and legend.  No fuss, reasonably priced, huge quantities, expansive menu, the best service ever.  EVER.  Randy's, I love you."}
{"text":"Good, basic food.  My burger basket included the burger, fries and a small 2 ounce ice cream at the end - which was just enough of a treat to cap off the meal.

Service was excellent.  I was seated quickly.  It was the height of the lunch rush, server did take a few minutes to come over and take my drink order, however she had acknowledged me when I was seated noting \"I'll be with you in a moment.\"  I appreciated that.  My server was also constantly refilling my iced tea, and at one point snuck in a refill while I was busy texting - didn't even notice!  She was good!

Was here on business, and I would go back."}
{"text":"This is your 'classic american diner'. They have wonderful dinners in the evening. Traditional mashed potato and gravy style dinners. Meatloaf, Liver and Onions etc...
A special every night for just $5.50. A long counter so if you are eating alone it is quick and comfortable. If feels like a small hometown diner. Reminds me of the Bakery and Coffee shop in the little southern Minnesota town I grew up in.

Great Eggs Benedict selection on weekends and mornings.

NO CREDIT CARDS or DEBIT CARDS. Bring your cash! They do have an ATM inside the door if you forget."}
{"text":"Randy's is one of those places where the food is always fresh and is closet thing to home cooking without cooking at home. And the prices are great! I especially like Sundays as they allow you to pick any daily special and the price to go along with it for the week. They also have daily specials that are very affordable. The daily dinner specials include soup or salad( albeit a very small salad) coffee or tea and Desert which by the way all of their deserts are homemade. It is a family owned and operated local place .We always try patron locally owned and operated businesses. Weekend breakfast is always very busy. Want fast ,fresh and affordable? Randy's is the place. Remember to bring cash $20 for 2 will more then cover it. They have an ATM just in case you forget! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went here on the recommendation of the Hotel Manager. So glad i did.
Interior was very clean mid-range restaurant. It is a warm entrance nothing fancy but a good feel.
Sat in a booth and the real reason for the 5 stars showed up. My waitress.
Super welcoming and she made me feel at home. I could tell from being in the business that all the wait staff was warm and professional and paying attention.
I grew up in upstate NY and i felt like i was back there. Real and friendly people who are looking at you and not thinking about texting someone.

I had the California Omelette with home-style potatoes bagel with cream cheese, side of bacon and coffee. All were good.

I took my time and left knowing i would be back again tomorrow and a few other times while i am here on business.

Sometimes i forget how much a welcoming experience can add to a meal.
So nice to have that when being alone out of town on business.

I also watched the interactions with all the other customers and saw that the customer was #1 . I eat out a lot in my travels and this level of attention is rare.
Randy's is an experience not just a good meal....i recommend you go have your own.
Can you tell i liked it there :-)"}
{"text":"MEH.

why did my food have to be bland and flavorless. I wish I would have gotten a hamburger instead. It looked so good after i ate half of my bland breakfast burrito with bacon(bacon and eggs you cant go wrong in a tortilla with cheese but THEY DID!).  So i added some salsa to it to see if it would kick it up a notch...Did it work? (oh hell no!) it just felt like it added unnecessary moisture to my burrito. So i had to call the waitress who i only saw for the most part when we first arrived and up until I got my extra hot sauce that was desperately needed severely. The fact I only ate half is bad for a business that means I didn't enjoy nearly as much as I should have.
I really really wanted to try their pies because they are supposed to be awesome and home made and I do not mind trying places that are supposed to have good pie because I like to compare and contrast to my own pies. 

But what really pissed me off is i had the time to ask her what kind of pie they had and then our waitress went missing did not come back til the guy I am a caregiver for finished all his food and wanted his bill. BUT i easily could have finished a pie ala mode before he finished his food if she came to check on us one time after the hot sauce incident. I was trying to figure out where the hell she was most of the time and I had noticed that she was outside waiting on tables. Why on earth would a manager allow a woman or man wait on a huge area in two different areas?

Huge pet peeve i easily could have given them 4-5 stars if the service was decent that day and they easily were on the right track up til the hot sauce incident. Then the down fall came with such force to make me rate this establishment a 2. 


Sad times. So much potential and they blew it."}
{"text":"I stopped by here to get an ice cream treat for me and my daughter. I did not realize they only except cash or check so I went to my car to grab some cash, which I realized I didn't have. I ran back in to let them know I did not have any but the manager told me to have a happy new year and it was on the house! What an awesome family owned restaurant! We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Linda was our server while we were here on vacation and was wonderful! The food was tasty and extremely fast, she was very attentive and very friendly! We had a cowboy burger and a buffalo chicken salad, both were very tasty! Thanks Linda!!

Ps. This place could use a facelift. The pink and blue tables and chairs are very outdated."}
{"text":"Nice experience. I was seated as soon as I walked in. The coffee was fresh and my food was yummy. I had the #7, and the diced potatoes were my favorite part."}
{"text":"We like Randy's for breakfasts, lunch and dinner. Sort of like being at home with friendly wait staff. Don't think any place in Scottsdale provides 3 course meals at better prices and the food tastes good. There is usually a crowd but seating is fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Favorite place!  Food is great & staff is so nice and efficient.  We have been coming to Randy's for years and it has always been super consistent.  If you want a restaurant with something for everyone and reasonably priced, this is your place.  Can't recommend it enough!!"}
{"text":"Menu has everything you would find at a family restaurant and the prices are low to medium. The staff is always very friendly and accommodating. Breakfast is the best  priced and comes out fast. Mostly caters to the local older crowd. A great place for a quick meal. No frills but has nice outdoor seating as well. THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH OR CHECK to keep prices down but have an ATM nearby if you need it. I've never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Their breakfasts aren't unusually outstanding, but they're solid, tasty and cooked to order. As a great lover of anything breakfast, I give them three stars for the many mornings I've enjoyed there.

On the other hand, I've had dinner here twice, and was thoroughly NOT impressed. Their corned beef and cabbage was average, but the fish and chips was outright bad. Skinny, tiny, barely-battered pieces of overcooked fish with NO FLAVOR.

I believe I'll stick with their breakfast food."}
{"text":"Our new family favorite. Classic diner. Amazingly yummy food which is quick to come out. So far we've had the pancakes, the BLT, the chicken salad, the hamburgers, the Reuben, the salmon filet, the fried chicken breast and the most amazing pecan pie I've had in along time! Their homemade chips are outrageous. It's all so good and at such a good price to boot. The best part though is the customer service. Everyone there has a smile and a kind word to say. Don't bring plastic tho...cash and checks only...it's so worth it!"}
{"text":"Love Randy's but their hash browns need serious work.  Wish they were perfect like Denny's."}
{"text":"We had eaten at Randy's a few years ago and weren't impressed.  We decided to give it another try over the holiday.  We stopped in twice.  Both times we were seated immediately.  Drinks were out within a few minutes.  We had our food in 10 minutes.

The order was accurate, the food was good, and the service was exceptional.  

Randy's is a cash-only restaurant.  They have an ATM at the front, and there is a Chase ATM nearby."}
{"text":"We were visitors from Los Angeles and Randy's was recommended by a business associate.  The food was great, the service was amazing ( women server was originally from Whittier ).   This place is a old school local diner with great prices, good people and good home cooked food.   We had the home made corned beef hash and eggs ,  stack pancakes with bacon and eggs.   We ordered and our food came so quick we thought they made a mistake.  Cash or check only so come prepared."}
{"text":"Omgosh.  This place is a block from my house so the location is convenient.  My initial perceptions before going were sketchy but once my husband and I went in for breakfast a few weekends back, we are weekend regulars!! 
The employees are so great! They are friendly and whether they are serving you or not, they give the friendliest greeting with a smile. Nothing phony. 
The place is VERY clean - dated but CLEAN. Just the 80's pink but it's cleverly nostalgic. My husband and I love sitting at the bar so we can watch morning sports after our workouts. The service is quick!! I don't think I've been anywhere with faster service - and even firing the busiest of morning breakfast hours!! The kitchen crew is crazy organized and efficient.  
The food is FABulous!! Yum yum!! My favorite is the skinny skillet. So freakin good. My husband is a big muscular guy and he easily is fueled up by the food, too. We will definitely keep coming back. Love this place!!!! 
They only take cash or checks which is probably why the prices are so great, too! But if you forget, they have an ATM by the front door. 
Get in here!!! :-)"}
{"text":"Bring cash with you because they don't take credit cards. They will take your check and they do provide an ATM inside of the restaurant. I liked this family style place! I liked it for the reasonable prices and something for everyone. We both had the special of the day and because it sells quickly they were busy changing the blackboard a few times while we were there. I had the chicken parm with spaghetti and garlic bread, a salad to start and a slice of heavenly chocolate cream pie, all for a bargain price of around $12.00. Hubby went with the pork chop special, applesauce and scalloped potatoes along with soup and ice cream for dessert. Same price! While the clientele was older we didn't mind that a bit as the food is fresh, the atmosphere that of a great diner and the wait staff friendly and efficient. I definitely want to go back for breakfast some time and highly recommend them for a good meal at a good price."}
{"text":"This place started out right away in my good graces with a friendly hearty greeting by our server wishing us a happy Valentine's Day. As I've said in so many of my reviews, it is service that makes a GREAT restaurant and this server clearly enjoyed her job and seemed to have done it for a while.  She greeted many of the regulars by name and made everyone feel welcome. It was clear she wanted everyone's day to start out great!

We arrived shortly after 7 on a Saturday and got seated in a booth right away. By 7:30 this place was really filling up including a whole youth baseball team of about 20 or so 16 year olds.

Our pleasant waitress took our order and our food was on the table in about the time it takes to make it through a fast-food drive through on a busy day. They serve all the classic diner breakfast items and I particularly liked the fried home style potatoes. We had eggs and has brown too -all done how you expect

Note: this place is CASH Only so be sure to stop at the atm before you drop in. You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, and the service is lightening fast!  The food was out within 10 minutes of us ordering, and it tasted fresh.  The prices are very reasonable, but be sure to bring cash!"}
{"text":"Went in to buy some of the ranch (because it is soooo good) and there was a terrible smell inside like maybe their bathrooms were backed up or something. But the workers are nice and pleasant. Hopefully they took care of the smell"}
{"text":"ok - so you wake up hungover on Sunday morning and think DAMN I'm hungry.  Please do not go to somewhere crappy like McDonald's.  Instead take your hungover self to Randy's and get some home-cooked, grandma-style, just-how-you-like-it breakfast.  This place is deceiving because it's in a shopping center, tucked away on the end and looks a little dated.  Do not let any of that fool you.  Randy's is incredible, and it's incredibly cheap.  They have a large, extensive menu, and you won't be disappointed!  Oh, do remember though, they only take cash.  Kind of old school, but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"The food is high quality diner food. Great service.
I really enjoyed their pies. Perfectly done, and obviously home made.. .Some of the best pies I've had in the valley.

Ice cream is also very good. Have a slice of rhubarb pie a la mode!"}
{"text":"Went here at 10 AM Sunday morning. No line, got seated promptly. Good selection of food and it came over VERY fast, that's good for a very hungry woman. So three stars for quick service and a nice waitress, but honestly the food was pretty boring. The sausage was juicy, but the bacon was too crunchy, the scrambled eggs mediocre and the grain cakes tasted strange. I love pancakes and I could barely eat these. There was WAY too much nutmeg or some spice in it. It was overwhelming. My friend could smell it from across the table. The food was cheap though so it was good enough to justify what we ate, but too many good breakfast options nearby to come back. Oh, and they only take cash or checks because the credit card company charges too much. And this is a decent-sized establishment! I've been to tiny whole-in-the-walls that took CCs. I was annoyed by this. It's 2011, let's get with the program!"}
{"text":"I would describe Randy's as a cute diner that serves comfort food. I think this is the only restaurant I've seen that only accepts cash or checks so be prepared for that. Food is pretty good. The servers are nice but when we went to pay the ladies at the front were less than pleasant. Asked a question about the ice cream having egg and the rude blonde lady just kept saying \"It's Dryers.\" Which I understood but does it have egg? She proceeded to check me out hastily and said \"I have no idea.\" I get it, you guys are old school but you should really know what you're selling! Especially with all the allergies people have now. I wanted to bring my nephew back for ice cream but he has a severe egg allergy; now I don't know if I will since it's so hard to get info out of the people serving the ice cream! Go in the back and read your ingredients. You weren't that busy to do so in the first place!"}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of their food at all, but our server was great. One of our friends had an emergency and had to leave right after getting her food and she took it off our bill. No problem"}
{"text":"Randy's is still the best place for breakfast. They are quick friendly and the food is always fantastic. I enjoy the chicken fried steak breakfast with a short stack of pancakes. My dog loves the dog friendly patio."}
{"text":"Been looking for a good diner, and found it!  Service was awesome (thank you Val)!!!  It's cash only, but all menu items are a great price. I was told that breakfast lines are out the door, but we'll definitely be back..."}
{"text":"WOW! Greatest and fastest service ever. We walked through the door, were sat, tended to and served in less than 12 minutes total. We were flabbergasted!! Their pancakes are so fluffy and delicious. Their skinny skillet is absolutely delicious (I added turkey sausage for added protein). Their coffee is strong and super tasty. Definitely coming back. Their prices are incredible! Please note cash or check only."}
{"text":"Cash only in this day and age?

We shop at the Safeway in the same shopping center as this place. It always seems busy so tonight we decided to give it a try.  We got there around 6:30 p.m. and it was fairly busy. In our mid-forties we felt like we were bringing the average age down significantly. OK, we can live with that. Second observation, welcome to the 80s. Its all pink banquettes and turquoise tabletops, with Scottsdale all being about looks and trends this seemed weird.

Our waitress was great. No complaints there. She was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Service was quick and friendly. 

We ordered the lasagna special and an egg salad sandwich. The lasagna came with a salad, which was delivered in a little ice cream dish cup. Cute! The lasagna came with garlic bread.  Part of the lasagna was burnt and covered up with sauce (Yuk). The egg salad sandwich was OK.  Also ordered dessert. We ordered the lemon meringue pie and cookies and cream ice cream. The lemon meringue pie was a huge disappointment. The \"lemon\" part of the pie was pasty and had zero lemon flavor. We had assumed the ice cream was home made but when paying we noticed it was just Dryers. 

When we checked out we noticed a sign that they accept cash and check only. We did not notice the small sign posted upon entering because it was hidden behind people waiting to pay. There is indeed an ATM with a $3 charge right by the register. How incredibly convenient.  When waiting about 8 minutes to pay we noticed a bunch of signs at the entry  that they are not seating incomplete parties, not wanting anyone to sit there to work or do homework, etc.... Seemed super unfriendly. 

So, in wrap-up; the food was mediocre, the service was great, but the method of payment and rather unwelcome signs do not warrant for a return.

NEED TO ADD THIS TO MY REVIEW (DAY AFTER ORIGINAL 5/20 POST). SO THE NO DEBIT OR CREDIT CARD POLICY FORCES YOU TO USE THE ATM AT THE CHECK OUT (BECAUSE WHO CARRIES CHECKS ANYMORE). THE ATM STATES THERE IS A $3 FEE. TODAY I CHECK MY BANK ACCOUNT AND THERE IS A $3 FEE AND A $2.50 FEE FROM THE ATM ON MY STATEMENT (NOT A FEE FROM MY BANK, THEIR ATM MACHINE). SO MY $20 DINNER ENDED UP COSTING ME $29.50 CENTS ($4 TIP AND $5.50 IN BANK FEES). A RESTAURANT THAT IS TOO CHEAP TO ACCEPT DEBIT OR CREDIT CARDS BUT THEN FORCES YOU TO USE THEIR ATM WHICH THEY SUPPOSEDLY NOT HAVE A STAKE IN GUARANTEES I WILL NEVER RETURN. FEELING TOTALLY RIPPED OFF."}
{"text":"Love the breakfast at Randy's!  Always delicious and the best service ever!  Do more events like breakfast with the birds! That was awesome!"}
{"text":"Randy's is my go to weekend breakfast spot. The service is fast and efficient. You wont find a better breakfast for the cost anywhere in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Cash only. We like this place, reminds me of low key Jersey diners. Not the selection of Greek specialties I am used to but solid diner style food. Dog friendly patio also good. Still working my way through the menu but so far so good. See pics for details."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time on Sunday.  It was packed but they sat us within 15 minutes. The food was good. If we get the chance we will go back."}
{"text":"$11 for more food than I could eat (eggs, corned beef hash, potatoes, toast), coffee, and fast and friendly service.  Bargain!!Definitely am old school place, but home made and lots of choices."}
{"text":"Pet friendly patio! Food and service was good! Does not accept plastic cash and check only!"}
{"text":"My family has been coming to Scottsdale for 15 years. This is by far one of the best homestyle breakfast places around. The service is quick and the food coming out of the kitchen is fast and good. (Way to go cooks)."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great meal. I had a breakfast that consisted of a ham and cheese omelette, hash browns and sourdough toast and my wife had the slim sandy which is egg whites, tomato slices and spinach on toasted sourdough bread. The taste for both meals was great, the service was excellent and the food came to our table in less then 5 minutes. It was as if the cooks were reading our lips when we gave the order to our waitress. Randy's is quite a drive from our home but whenever we're in the area it's a definite go to."}
{"text":"Maybe the most pleasant diner I've ever been to! The food was ready so incredibly fast, the staff were all very warm and friendly, and the food was delicious! The coffee was fresh, and refills seemed limitless! I wish I could've stayed all day. I will recommend this place to everyone!!! :)"}
{"text":"Great food, fast and affordable!  Make your experience even better by asking for Jackie, the best server there!  Great service and she has a great sense of humor making Randy's the best place for breakfast in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I really like Randy's. I meet a group of guys here every Wed. I have had many items on their menu. I really enjoyed the big-mess burger, the salads are good and you can get the chicken crispy or grilled. While I enjoy the food, it is the awesome sundaes that everyone needs to experience. Mountains of ice cream, so delicious! 

The best part of my weekly dining experience is our server Lila - she is the best and we all look forward to seeing her as much as each other"}
{"text":"Excellent ice cream and great patio for pets! 100% covered and the floor is nice and cool. They bring your dog water and they have a nice small scoop of ice cream you can get for fido!"}
{"text":"We came here for a cheap breakfast. The portion size was good. We both felt sick after eating though. Eggs?"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend because I've seen this place a lot when I used to work up in Scottsdale.  I was VERY impressed.

Service was fast, food hot and fresh within 3 minutes of ordering.  I even liked their green beans and I hate green beans usually.  

Portions are big for your money, and delicious.  Their meat loaf is really good. 

Tons of breakfast, lunch and dinner items, and a big selection of desserts from ice cream to fresh made pies.  

Their only drawback, they take cash only.  There is an ATM machine in the lobby though."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a classic diner experience, then this is it. The atmosphere is bustling and fun, and the restaurant is jam packed with patrons of all ages. The menu is pretty huge, but once you order, the food is out in a flash.

The patio is very dog friendly, and they bring out water bowls for the pooch as soon as you sit down, which is much appreciated.

FYI -- Cash/check only, but there's an ATM inside."}
{"text":"We love Randy's in my family! My dad took me here growing up, and I now take my son. The service is always fast, everyone so is friendly, and you feel like you're getting a home cooked meal. It's these things that keep us coming back! :)"}
{"text":"I feel bad for giving that review, because my husband and his family is going to Randes for years.
During the past 2 years I went there several times and it just gotten worse and worse.
Yes, they are super quick, but this is because nothing is really fresh. The chicken was probably cooked a couple days ago and just thrown on the grill for a few seconds. Super dry and no taste.
They don't use any kind of flavouring or spices. 
I tried various dishes from breakfast to lunch and nothing was good. Wouldn't complain if this would have been a $4 lunch, but a burrito for 10 with soaked cold fries isn't just doing it for me.
Sorry, won't go here again, there are just too many good choices around to put that kind of bad food in my body and even paying for it"}
{"text":"This place has been around awhile, and I think I stopped in a few times for dessert when I was younger, but recently I discovered it for breakfast and really like it!

In the last few months I've been here like, 4-5 times. I've had a couple different omelettes, the breakfast sandwich, and the breakfast burrito (maybe something else I'm not remembering?). Everything is pretty solid. I like that you get a choice of either hashbrowns OR breakfast potatoes with your meal. 

Like others have said, Randy's will have your order ready FAST. Almost, scary fast. No matter how busy they seems to be, and no matter how many people I've been here with I'm not kidding when I say most orders have come to the table within about 5 minutes. The servers here are also all extremely friendly. It seems likes there's a lot of regulars here (one of the guys I've come here with a couple times is). Also, the breakfasts are pretty cheap. 

I'm sure most of the reviews mention this, but Randy's is also one of the few places around that's cash only. The do have an ATM in the restaurant though."}
{"text":"Rock-bottom prices and fast friendly service are the highlights of this neighborhood diner. I stepped inside and liked the retro feel of this place. It was a busy morning for them on Friday at 9 A.M., but service was still cheerful and friendly. I decided to get an order to go at the counter to the side of the entrance. 

I ordered the #2 breakfast special: Corned beef hash, potatoes, 2 eggs, and toast. Quite a lot of food for only $6! You get your choice of how you want your eggs cooked, and type of potatoes and toast. I decided on poached eggs, country potatoes, and wheat toast.

I only waited maybe 5 minutes for my order. Wow they are fast! Driving home, the delicious savory smells wafted through my car, increasing my hunger for breakfast! I opened up the to-go boxes and found hearty portions of each component of my meal. They were as follows:

Corned beef hash: Looked like it came straight from a can (Perhaps a Hormel can?) Tasty nonetheless (I grew up on that stuff!), and it looked like they dumped the whole can's contents, griddled it, and put it in my meal.

Country potatoes: Perfectly cooked and griddled, with a good savory taste.

Poached eggs: They came in a small Styrofoam cup with lid to keep the other parts of my meal from getting soggy. The yolks were a little more hard-cooked than I usually like.

Toast: The weakest part of the meal. I got 2 whole slices of buttered wheat toast, but each slice was burnt. The toast came with one packet of grape jelly.

Overall, it was a lot of food for the amount I paid, and I ate everything (Except the really burnt parts of the toast) with gusto. They accept cash or check only, which keeps prices down. 

Since it was cold outside that morning, I didn't venture out to the patio area, but it looked nice. One of these days, in nicer weather, I'd like to try it out. I hear they are dog-friendly too, so maybe my pup will come along for the ride!"}
{"text":"The food and service has always been great.  BUT!  Tonight our server Lylia came across very rude and seem that she did not want to be working tonight. We asked for Linda but she was busy. That just tells you they have good servers.  We had to ask for refills extra napkins and rolls.  She never check on us and stood behind the counter chatting.
If I get put in her section again I will be asked to be moved."}
{"text":"2nd visit my order came missing the main ingredient, they never mention until you do.  No compensation just take it as it is or pick something else.  They even had the nerve to tell me the tab was wrong it should be $1 more, to which I replied \"to compensate for the missing avocado in my salad\"  all I got was a sorry!! 

Once while waiting for a table I complained about taking another party over us I was told \"they were ahead of you\"  WRONG I watch them come in, this from the owner which (she ) preceded to tell me in front of a packed restaurant--I was not rude or loud just mentioned it.  She then preceded to argue with younger women if front of everyone....she definitely needed a chill pill.

3rd time--- I'm done.  

Besides the smell, haggard looking restaurant and the prices are not that cheap.  
Randy you need to step back re look at the place, menu and prices. 

I have nothing bad to say about the waitresses."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. They are very affordable and the servings are large. It's family owned and operated, you can feel the difference from chain restaurants and I enjoy it. The only reason that I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because of all of the times that I've ordered scrambled eggs they have only been good once. Great place for breakfast, just don't order scrambled eggs."}
{"text":"Not impressed in the least.

crowded for what? the food? NOT. old folks looking for their next victim to black widow. Must be.

chopped california cobb was a small portion, but good for lunch. problem was they must have microwaved the chicken then mixed the whole salad together thereby rendering the chicken cool and the salad warm and grossly wilted.

save your time and money and let the codgers stay here and socialize with randy and his wife at the next booth over.

boo"}
{"text":"We've been regulars at Randy's for years.  They serve decent food at reasonable prices.  It's not particularly inventive or extraordinary, but you generally know what to expect and some of their specials are really quite good.  We like their burger baskets served with fries, coleslaw and a tiny scoop of ice cream.  High-boy burger with 2 patties, onions, cheese & thousand island dressing keeps hubby smiling.  I also like their $4.99 specials, no substitutions but just the right amount of food for me.

The servers are friendly and efficient and keep the tables turning over.  Owners are always present to make sure things everything flowing.  They know how to run the business.  You can be in and out in half the time of a regular sit-down restaurant if you like.  

Randy's has a loyal following with some folks making this their regular dining table.  They cater to an older crowd, many who come for the cheery familiar service as much as the food.

If you are looking for a gourmet experience, keep moving.  

Overall value and dependability keep us coming back."}
{"text":"I just discovered they have Creamed Dried Beef (aka Cream Chipped Beef aka S.O.S) there is NOOOOOO other place I've found that serves that! 
As if I didnt go out to eat often enough, Ill be going way more often. This is officially MY FAVORITE restaurant. Not to mention they are inexpensive, and FAST"}
{"text":"What can I say, they are one friendly good old American Breakfast joint. Staff are \"annoyingly\" (not because they were annoying, but not what you get from a lot of restaurants these days, so, it's a compliment) friendly.
Food are nicely done, seasoning....well, it is \"balanced\". The eggs are done just right, the sausage and bacon are a little bit salty (as expected), the harshbrown was perfectly crispy on the outside, but still moist on the inside....just not much seasoning. Not the end of the world because I find that to be just right pairing with the sausage and bacon. The pancakes is perfectly balanced between airy and dense. Very nice.
Overall, a lovely place to have a brunch. No wonder they were voted the best breakfast diner in town"}
{"text":"The breakfast is the best! We are always amazed how fast our order arrives, the kitchen is super fast. From pancakes to the breakfast sandwich it is delicious. Definitely great comfort food, nothing fancy and the prices are very fair.  Downside, no credit cards and no wifi."}
{"text":"I was taken here by an elderly friend.  When I walked in, I truly thought it would be Denny's food.  The décor was minimal, dated, completely no-frills.  Ya, I was being judgy.  lol

Sat down, read the menu, and it was straight-forward, diner-type food.  Liver and onions, chicken parm, burgers, fried cod sandwich, breakfast...  My experience is that when places like that try to do everything, they end up doing nothing.

I ordered a double patty burger with pickles, cheese, thousand island dressing, and fried onions.  With a side of fries.  I kept my expectations low, thinking when it sucked, I could waltz next door to Safeway, and have them make me a sandwich.

Lunch comes, and comes quickly.  Soft and fresh sesame bun, two hand-formed, thick beef patties, and all the fixins.  Fries were made fresh, medium cut, totally non-oily.  I ate EVERY bite.  Like, stab the stray onion nib on the plate with the toothpick, kinda every bite.

The place offers homemade pies and ice cream.  I had a slice of mud pie.  $3, mind you.  That was scoffed as well.

My friend had egg salad and a hot fudge sundae.  Bill for both of us, including beverages (refilled without asking, btw), was $21.

To me, the low prices were just bonus.  I have no problem paying gobs of (someone else's) money for great food.  But, this place had it all.  Homestyle, fresh, good food, friendly and attentive servers and management, and, great prices.

I can't wait to go back.  :)"}
{"text":"Food and service were mediocre at best. Cost was about the same as anywhere else. Would rather go to Breakfast Club."}
{"text":"I love this place! Staff is very friendly & great at what they do. Menu is awesome, lots of choices & price is very affordable. Food is on my table in a matter of minutes & is always so yummy! My favorite dish is the Spicy Big Daddy Hash (homemade corn beef hash) for breakfast & also the rueben sandwich for lunch."}
{"text":"I think for the average person I would give it 4  stars but for the reasons stated below it dropped significantly!  If I cannot be safe then what's the point?  First off a yelp check in offer appears for this restaurant stating a deal on gluten free toast.  According to the Manager they don't advertise with yelp and think that yelp is a rip off because if you don't advertise with them then you get less stars...so that is why she'd never advertise with yelp. So I don't know why that comes up on my phone app.

I am a celiac so it is dangerous for my health if I eat gluten (wheat, barley, etc.)  This restaurant offers gluten free toast and pancakes.  Most people would assume that since they offer these choices then they would follow cross contamination guidelines and know how to prepare food to keep people with Celiac safe.

This is not the case. Yesterday, I had an excellent waitress.  I asked her point blank if the gluten free toast (which is more expensive) was toasted in a dedicated toaster.  She said that yes, it was toasted.  I then said again specifically, \"So you have a toaster JUST for the gluten free toast?  And you are using separate utensils and butter?\"  She looked at me like I was speaking Russian (and that is NEVER a good sign when addressing these issues.)

She stated, it's toasted in the big toaster we use for the toast.  AH!  So then I asked if they prepare the gluten free pancakes on the same griddle as the regular ones and prep those in the same area as well.  And the answer (that I figured was coming) was yes.  No, there is no other prep area in the back for keeping gluten free items apart.  No cross contamination education imparted.  She didn't even understand that there needed to be any procedures followed. 

Now, don't get me wrong, this was a very nice waitperson.  She was very concerned when I was asking her these questions.  I asked her if she could make sure that someone with clean hands (not having touched regular items) could get me my slices of gf bread and just put them on my plate and not toast it?  And she did that for me herself!

Pretty soon the Manager came over to follow up on the gf toast issue.  I asked her again if they had training and separated areas for the gf products and she said that they did not.  I asked her why they didn't if they were offering gluten free toast and pancakes.  I told her that I get sick when the toast is made in the same toaster from the other bread crumbs being on my gf toast.  That I had eaten it there before and now understood why I had been sick!

Her answer (I kid you not!) was that people with Celiac Disease should just KNOW that a restaurant like theirs wouldn't follow protocols or that a person should ASK how they were prepared.   They just offered gluten free items for people restricting gluten from their diet for lifestyle.

REALLY?  Advertising something gluten free and charging significantly higher prices for it do NOT get you access to the safety of training your employees?  NOT stating that on your menu?  I now KNOW that she knows there is a difference since she said that she expects Celiac's to know they won't follow safety precautions!

I told her that I think that she is endangering people's health and that her answers were not acceptable.  Her entire explanation was that I couldn't possibly hold her responsible for my issues if I didn't explicitely state my needs to her so they could tell me their gf foods are unsafe for me to consume.

I won't be back!  But if you don't have gluten or other dietary issues.....go ahead on!"}
{"text":"Randy's is your regular solid old fashion diner. It's not fancy so you can literally go however you are. It's always crowded but you can get a table pretty quick or sit at the counter. The service is good and fast and the food comes quickly and hot. The breakfast potatoes and pancakes are so good and so is the tuna melt if you get there late and do lunch. They also have a little ice cream and pie bar which is fun if you dine with kids or want some for yourself. Make sure you bring CASH they do not take debit or credit cards which is kind of weird in 2017 but hey."}
{"text":"Wow! Stopped here for a quick breakfast while house hunting in the area. I was blown away by the service and quality of food. Certainly not an upscale place by any means but it has the comfortable old style neighborhood diner feel with pink booths and neon signage. 

We were seated right away by a friendly and attentive waiter. I never wanted for anything including timely coffee refills, extra butter and hot sauce. 

I got gluten free toast and can confidently say it was the best gluten free toast I've ever had. I'll be back to try the gluten free pancakes soon! Prices are very affordable and portions are big. 

This place is a real gem. Can't go wrong with Randy's."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place. Always stop here for a breakfast lunch and dinner when I'm the mood. Never had a bad meal. I like the meatloaf, mashed potatoes and green beans...Thursday lunch special for $5.90! They don't take credit or debit as it keeps costs down."}
{"text":"This place was packed on a Friday evening!

I waited in line for about 5 minutes even though it looked like it could have been a long wait.

Once I opened the menu i realized why the prices are cheap and the menu vast.

For some reason I felt like breakfast for dinner but they dont serve it at night , no problem the menu is huge.

I ordered the cobb salad

When it came i was not impressed at first glance it seemed a little small but it had all the right ingredients. It was the first bite i found out this place is full because they use great ingredients fresh lettuce avocado even the bacon bits were fresh. 

If you want some really good American style food I would recommend this to anyone in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Really solid breakfast joint. I ordered the corned beef hash off the regular menu and this is what happened next: 

Hun. Do you like corned beef? 

I think so. I order it a lot. 

You're gonna want the super special Randy's corned beef (or whatever it's called), we make that fresh. That stuff you just ordered comes from a can. 

Oh yeah that does sound better. I'll take that. 

And it was better. I'm guessing anyway. It was really good. I don't know why they would keep some inferior corned beef on the menu. Also, solid coffee."}
{"text":"OK.  Food hmmmm. Menu a joke. Their ownership, poor examples of professed Christians, since I have never heard such vulgar language. I would NEVER go back!!!!  We have a lot of great breakfast places!   This is just a bit more closer in mileage, but not worth it!"}
{"text":"It's hard to screw up breakfast and Randy's delivers consistency every time I dine there.  Despite feeling like an AARP card is required to even step foot into the place, I've always left content with my meal.

What I love about Randy's:
Consistency - again it's hard to screw up breakfast, but I still enjoy knowing what's coming my way.
Speed - I have never spent more than 30 minutes in this place and have often dined in 20 minutes.  Phenomenal! 
Price - One of the cheapest breakfasts around even compared to IHOP, Denny's, and Coco's.

For the people complaining about cash only - step away from your credit cards, I promise it will be ok.  Those 5-7 airline miles you're not earning from this meal aren't worth the bickering."}
{"text":"A blast from the past - if your past was hanging out at Denny's in Sun City. It's more of a senior joint, but the food is pretty good and priced fair. It's a place you would go grab a bite with grandma... maybe have a slice of pie. 

Service is good, food is good, prices are right, and daily specials. The only real drawback is the atmosphere. It's comfy and clean and all that, but it's just really dated - and even in the late 80s/early 90s this look wasn't terribly hip. That, and the fact they don't take credit cards knocks off one star."}
{"text":"Although located far from us, we usually stop here when in the area.   They have an extensive menu for a coffee shop/restaurant.   Food always arrives cooked to order and promptly. Located close to a residential area,  they have lots of regulars who are usually greeted by name. 

If you are looking for gourmet food,  this is NOT your place.   If,  however, you want excellent food that is well prepared and promptly served at a reasonable price,  this definitely IS your place! 

P.S. This restaurant is owned by the same family for 30+ years and has many very long time employees.   They most be doing something right!!!!"}
{"text":"Of the many breakfast places I've visited in Scottsdale this is the first one that I can definitely say be returning too. The food here is very good, and reasonably priced. If your looking for a more traditional breakfast that's going to fill you up this is the place! 

Just be prepared to pay cash, there is an atm if you forget."}
{"text":"If I could give it more than 5 stars I would. This tends to draw an older crowd on weekend mornings but if you're in the need of a great breakfast to cure the night before Randy's is the best spot to go. The portions are huge, the service is non-stop (coffee never gets more than half way before it's refilled)  Literally the fastest service I've ever experienced. We time it as a game to see how quick we get our food...3 minutes and change is the average! The owners and staff are so nice always a warm greeting with a giant smile. It's cash only but they do have an ATM at the front counter."}
{"text":"The food here is good. I paid nine dollars for a meal and then had to pay over three dollars at their ATM because I didn't have cash. I feel sorry for the waiters and waitresses who's tips are probably affected by Randy's deal with the ATM company and desire to save bucks on having a credit card machine. It's sad because great food and service."}
{"text":"Important note... CASH AND CHECKS ONLY! Credit cards are not accepted.  I was a little unprepared for that and completely missed the big notice in the window, but fortunately I had a check on hand to pay for our meal. But don't worry... If you don't have a check they at least have an ATM inside. Aside from my being unprepared with cash, the experience was great! We brought our dog and sat out on the patio. They brought a bowl of water for the dog and were very attentive. The food was fresh, delicious, and they were perfect portions.  We followed it up with some scrumptious ice cream and pie for dessert. It was a perfect afternoon.  P.S. If you are a potato chip fan, try the house chips. They were amazing!"}
{"text":"You get your food so fast here it's CRAZY. 
This is a go-to breakfast spot for me and my boyfriend. Their patio is dog friendly as well!!! So that's a huge plus. Remember to bring CASH."}
{"text":"Awesome place near old town to grab breakfast - even on the weekends they are FAST - get bacon in your mouth in less than five minutes... 2 eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, and toast will set you back about $7... 

...or you could choose someplace super trendy and wait an hour in line with the other hungover idiots."}
{"text":"Randy's has become our go to breakfast spot. The place is always packed on the weekends and I know why. This place has very good breakfast for a very good price. Most breakfast items, which come with toast and delicious hashbrowns, will only set you back $5-$6. They menu here is huge, so you most likely will have a hard time deciding what to order. The service here is amazing as you literally order and get your food within 5 minutes. The only drawback to this place is that it is cash only, but they do have an ATM."}
{"text":"THIS IS MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN SCOTTSDALE! You don't have to get dressed up, you never have to wait long for you food (no matter how busy it is), and they consistently have delicious food. The service is fantastic and they really make you feel welcome. I love going here for breakfast but we have started going here for dinner as well. If I have a bad day my husband always says \"Randys?\" for some good old fashioned American Comfort food. Country Fried Steak, Chicken Parmesan, Verde Burger. Exceptional Food, exceptional prices, exceptional people. Love, Love, Love Randys!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Fast and cheap, super friendly service. Lots of choices for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Great neighborhood spot for any meal. Be warned, it's cash only."}
{"text":"My first visit today and very impressed with this place. I sat myself at the bar and the wait staff is very friendly. I no sooner ordered my breakfast for $4.75, it was placed can in front of me with in minutes. This place is full of regulars as they said good morning and gossiped away. :)"}
{"text":"Randy's is a great family owned restaurant. Breakfast is fast and great food. The country potatoes are a side with almost every breakfast combo.  They have great flavor with the peppers and onions.  If you like a little less spice to start your morning, the hash browns are just that perfectly cooked staple. Randy of Randy's is normally overseeing the operation of this establishment and he is quick to make sure it runs smoothly. By no means is he just looking, he is working also but with a sharp eye on everything.  That was just breakfast, let's move on to lunch. Remember the good old days of the \"blue plate special?\" Well, they don't exactly call it that there, it is just a great group of choices from meatloaf to \"you name it.\" The pies are great and the cinnamon rolls are awesome. (Better get there early if you want a Cinnamon Roll)  The ice cream selection and desert combinations are reminiscent of the old ice cream shops from yesteryear and will bring a smile to young and old. 
Dogs are welcome on the patio and they quickly bring a bowl of water for Fido are allowed but   Randy's is the favorite of all of my out of town guests. 
I wish I could give it 6 stars but 5 is the max. 
Enjoy Randy's. I sure do. 

Oh and bring cash, checks and debit cards are not accepted."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Scottsdale. Great tasting food, fair pricing and fantastic desserts. Bing cash, no credit or debit cards accepted."}
{"text":"My #1 breakfast place of all time.. Amazing prices and you get a lot of food! I always get #17.. It's amazing!!

Only thing they could do better is accept credit cards.. They are a cash only place, I'm sure this keeps prices low. They also have an ATM onsite which helps.."}
{"text":"1 star is being very generous. If I can not give a star I would have. First our little Asian server didn't know anything about the menu and couldn't answer any of our questions. Then she had a nervous laugh the whole time we were taken care of by her which was super annoying. Next all the food is beyond flavorless and extremely bland. All the meats are boiled nothing is actually cooked. I sent my.meal back because I couldn't eat it due to the fact it had a funky taste to it. When I called over another server to ask for our server she immediately attacked me. What do you want?? How professional is she? I told her she didn't have to be so nasty and she got even nastier.  All cash is for a reason so when you have a shitty meal you can't dispute the charge. This place is horrifically bad and I can't believe people actually eat there and say it's good. Do not waste your time with this place. If you can't eat your food they make you pay for it anyways. The owner could care less too about the poor service and lousy food we got. Horrible service, horrible food."}
{"text":"Randy's is a hoot on St. Pattick's Day; their biggest day of the year! They serve corned beef and cabbage or Reuben sandwiches to everyone in an Irish mood. They use 1000 pounds of corned beef this day.  Everyone working and many patrons are dressed in Irish green. Great fun and food for all!"}
{"text":"Here's the thing about Randy's; if you are looking for fancy, hip, alcohol, and artistic food in your breakfast joint selection... you are not going to like Randy's.  That being said, if you are looking for midwestern-diner-food quality with tons of options, affordable pricing, and service so fast it makes you tired watching; you sir or madame are in for a treat.

Nestled into a classic Arizona strip mall, Randy's gives you the option of avoiding chain diners like Denny's or IHOP, but still keeping the benefits.  Who says you can't have your local cake and eat it too?

Randy's accepts cash or personnel checks, which should tip you off on the median age of its patrons.  There is a long counter you can snag a seat at if you are flying solo, as well as a few old TV's up behind it playing sports/news for the morning crowd... or you could just go with the diner vibe and watch the kitchen behind the pass-thru window and see if you can figure out how they are so gosh darn efficient with so much variety.  Randy's has an ice cream counter where you pay the tab, along with an ATM for emergencies. The place is fairly large, and there is decent outdoor seating for when its not the blistering dog days of summer, as well as plenty of parking.  It's not very pretty in there, the whole place including the booths, ranges in color from pink to mauve and back again (desert 90's chic) but it gets the job done andddddd the servers always seem to be on point with the coffee refills, which ranks about x10 higher in my book of breakfast importance.

Now I love a showy brunch, most likely more so then the next person, but when I am in the mood to eat and not take all day... Randy's fits the bill.  Is Randy's 4 stars in comparison to a trendy brunch spot with all the bells and whistles and a celebrity chef?  No.  Is Randy's 4 stars for great service, breakfast food that looks and tastes like you expect, and the ability to: get in, get fed, and get out without \"rushing the experience\"?  You betcha."}
{"text":"Nice little mom and pop restaurant on Chaparral and Hayden Road. I live close by and go there once in a while for late weekend breakfasts. The food is good and prices are low. The menu is very long and you may have any kind of food. Everything tastes fresh. The staff is super friendly. If you go, remember to take cash, because they do not accept credit cards. They do have an ATM machine next to the main entrance, but you will get charge the fees. So don't forget the cash!"}
{"text":"Great little find!  I have driven by this place a gazillion times and finally stopped in yesterday for a late breakfast.  I had the skinny scramble. Egg whites, feta, spinach, mushrooms and tomatoes over a smaller size portion of the country potatoes.  YUMMY!  Huge menu with lots of choices.....I will definitely go back to sample other menu items!!"}
{"text":"This is a good place for a quick meal. We've eaten breakfast here a few times. The food is always decent, the service always prompt. 
Here's the thing - I always feel RUSHED, totally rushed. 
I'm not the type of person that nurses a drink,  takes up a table for hours or sips coffee all morning. I don't even read the paper while I'm there, although I might like to if I didn't feel so rushed.

This morning I noticed a sign that says \"During our busy times, please do not conduct your business meetings, studying..\" I can't remember the rest but I found it offensive.

I can understand that they don't want people taking up a table when paying customers are waiting. I totally get that. 
However, the place is huge and I've never waited for a table. 

Perhaps if the wording was different. If people are hanging out, aren't they spending money? Even if they're drinking coffee? 
Maybe the patio could be self service so waiters don't have to miss out on customers. 

It totally rubbed me the wrong way and it's plastered as soon as you walk in the door. It's like saying \"Don't enjoy your time here, get in and get out!\"
In this economy you think they'd be happy to have any business."}
{"text":"We Had a great breakfast on Tuesday.  The place is and has always been spot on.  Our waitress Laura got everything perfect.  It was so delicious. The coffee is some of the best around.

Keep up the good work.

Dawn and Mark"}
{"text":"Randy's is your special local breakfast/lunch spot that is always full of people and great service. I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table on the weekend, even during their busiest times. It's the kind of restaurant you go to that makes you feel right at home and leaves you smiling. 

I've only gone for breakfast but it's my boyfriends go-to spot whenever his dad is in town visiting. They love the place and now I do too. It's incredibly affordable and the meal sizes are big. I usually get their standard breakfast, bacon, eggs over medium, toast, and hashbrowns. YUM. The hot coffee that keeps on giving is that traditional cup of joe you look for in a spot like this. 

I'm not going to lie, it's not fancy, it's not going to be 5-star restaurant food, but if you're looking for a heartwarming, welcoming place, that will be nice to your wallet and fill your belly, then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Good ole Randy's serves a good ole breakfast.
I've lived in Scottsdale for more than ten years and not once have I came here although I shopped in this strip mall many times.
My husband and I ordered the chicken fried steak, two eggs, toast, and a side of bacon! Everything was good and we were happy with the result. This is a quick diner type restaurant so don't come here for the fluff!
Ps- cash only!"}
{"text":"Five stars for meeting my expectations over the years.  Food is above average; service is pleasant and fast; it take no more than 4 minutes from placing order to food arriving at breakfast.

It all depends on one's expectations.  I have never had a problem nor disappointment with the food and service.  

Nothing fancy; just good old American food.  Lots of senior citizens from the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Been coming to Randys for years. One of the better mom and pop restaurants you will ever go to. If you are ever in Scottsdale you should come here"}
{"text":"strict adherence to a well defined set of ethical yelping guidelines is all that is keeping me from giving randy's 5 stars. the truth is that i love randy's and hope it stays open for one thousand years. which it might. 

randy's is a diner for the geriatric crowd north of old town in scottsdale, arizona. it features a lot of muted pastels, physical copies of newspapers, and really weak coffee. the wait staff is a hodgepodge of goofballs and misfits, most of whom i adore. 

i can only comment on breakfast. 5 cups of randy's coffee translates to roughly one cup of....normal coffee. the best meal i've had here is the big daddy's hash with two over medium eggs on top of it. that meal is very good. the pancakes are good - please add bananas if you care about yourself / your short experience on earth. the bacon is OK but if you ask them to make it extra crispy they will definitely do it. the grits are OK. the country potatoes are good. the hash browns are good. the fruit bowls are OK. the pie is very good. 

basically randy's is immensely predictable, and often totally hits the spot for me. it hurts me to think about mentioning the downsides of randy's because i don't want to, but here they are:

the menu is too big
why is it called randy's ice cream? it's a diner
the coffee is bbbbbaaaaaaaaaaddddddd 
food is hit or miss - you've gotta know what to order
the water is gross
cash only and the ATM fee is $3.50 or something similarly criminal
birds will eat your food if you sit outside

overall this is unquestionably an A-OK establishment that has a little bit of weird charm and a lot of convenience that keeps me coming back. don't bring a date here. don't bring a snobby relative here. do bring a good friend or your down to earth college professors here.  

i feel a little bad in my heart saying that it's 3 stars because i'm here 3x a month and everyone here is lovely. but, like i said, ethics.

much love and see you soon.

{"text":"I absolutely adored our waitress. She was incredibly kind and catered to our needs even before we had a chance to acknowledge them. Food was brought out in a matter of minutes despite their busy flow of patrons. Can't say that I have anything bad to say about my experience here."}
{"text":"Randy is an awesome casual eatery topped with ice cream, how sweet is this!  menus are posted on boards throughout the dining room.  It is a very informal restaurant, no credit cards, cash only please.  It has an ATM at the entrance just in case (extra fee applies).  Once you know how they rule, everything's cool.
Service there is very friendly, quick and as soon as you've placed your order it gets done at the speed of light!  Five minutes later we were served.  I had the Slim Sandy, an egg white with tomato and spinach sandwich, cottage cheese on the side.  Ron had the ham & cheese omelet with hash  browns and toast.
One ice tea and water. Total $18.03 incl. taxes.
All was good, nothing fancy but all was yummy on a Sunday afternoon!"}

But, this place is wonderful!
Fast, friendly service.    Delicious food,wonderful people.   I had the make your own omelet and wow.   Some crispy hash browns and a side of grits I was in a food utopia.  
Honestly the most friendly people I have met in the service industry!
I highly recommend this restaurant if you are visiting Scottsdale!
If you see my friend tell her thanks for opening my eyes to this amazing place!"}

Above is a real convo between my mother and I about going to Randy's for bfast. We absolutely love this place. 
Awesome friendly service, food was great as usual and the price is right. 

Bring cash and they will not seat you if your party isn't all there yet. 

I love this place!"}
{"text":"This is THE place to be for the older folks. The cute little seniors all seemed to know one another and it was nice taking a break from the usual Scottsdale crowd and watching them interact w/ one another. 

The food however was not as enjoyable.. for me, at least. I had the philly cheese with well done fries for lunch. It was so bland and flavorless I had to dip it in ranch and Tabasco (and I don't even like Tabasco). Good thing the prices are pretty reasonable. I might be back to try out some basic breakfast items since it's usually pretty simple and hard to screw up. 

Just remember that it's a cash only joint!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It's a small neighborhood diner reminds me of the diners in Chicago! I've been coming here for three decades and the service is fast, the family that owns it is amazing, the people that work here are friendly, the food is delicious, and it's inexpensive! Comfort food at its best...I highly recommend you come here."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars, I would! Awful all around! My girlfriend and I met for breakfast the Sat after Thanksgiving. She was about 5 min away, but the hostess refused to seat us until she arrived. Whatever...I can roll with it. Then, I notice 2 tacky little signs indicating \"We take cash only\" and some nonsense about not having meetings or studying there..i.e. don't take up too much time. I should have bolted right then! The food is marginal at best, nothing outstanding at all about it. I will admit, it's cheap. However, here's the ickiest thing about Randy's. A male waiter in his late 40's-early 50's passed by our table and my friend politely asked him for a refill on her coffee. He replied \"I will only refill your cup if you do this\" and proceeds to shake his chest toward us. We gave a blank stare and he said \"I saw you shake your chest when you walked in.\" We both just sat there stunned! Not only was it incredibly offensive and inappropriate, it bordered on sexual harassment. Also- my young children heard the whole exchange. I will NEVER step foot inside this place again. Terrible experience all around and the waiter should be fired!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here, Best service, prices and breakfast in Scottsdale, No waiting for food here, you will have in a blink of the eye.  have been going here for years,
all always a favorite when  in town. And locally owned, a must place to go .....
expect a wait on Sunday morning. Very popular."}
{"text":"Fourth or fifth time I'm here and I love this place! Food is good and prices are very convenient, especially if you're just one person...with 10/12 dollars you have soup or salad, main course and dessert! Just perfect for a lazy college student like me! Also the staff is very kind :-)"}
{"text":"We found this place after trying RnR, breakfast club and all the other trendy places on Scottsdale. Those places had snobby wait staff
The wait staff every week at Randy's
 are friendly and accommodating
The food is home cooked and awesome 
Gluten free pancakes bread and more 
They cater to healthy and home goodness"}
{"text":"You Take Your Chances Here...GREAT BASIC BREAKFAST, Otherwise So-So Cafeteria Quality Food.

I have been eating at Randy's off and on for several years now. I just want to temper the reviews with some reality about what to expect...

Initially I ate breakfast only, and generally the same item, #8 (2 eggs, two bacon or sausage, hash brown or country potatoes, and toast). They learned to cook my eggs perfectly, my bacon crispy, and my country potatoes crisp and with onions (the hash browns are tasteless and not crisp at all). I also occasionally enjoyed Randy's Breakfast, substituting a waffle for the short stack of pancakes. I tried the chicken fried steak and eggs, but the chicken fried steak was soggy (not crisp) and pretty tasteless, and I tried their corned beef hash, which was very salty and tasted canned. That was easily solved by sticking to my favorites, which have been consistently excellent.

Morning service was always GREAT! They have wonderful staff, ALWAYS make you feel welcome, and work to ensure that your order comes out correctly and QUICKLY. They are super fast and super attentive!  

That said, as long as I stuck to my familiar breakfast items, I was on very safe and tasty terrain. 

Fast forward to my more recent experiences since older (much) friends of mine have encouraged me to venture beyond breakfast at Randy's. 

I haven't had anything from their lunch or dinner menu that was better than average - at best - but often sub par. I'll give them props on their mashed potatoes, but the commercial gravy is awful, and I can't speak well of anything else except that their seasonal daily specials are only $5.50, and that buys a great deal of forgiveness for so-so cafeteria quality food.

If you are not that picky, you will be fine, but there is nothing remarkable for which to be here after breakfast unless you just want to fill up. 

I don't object to the lack of ambiance - the staff more than makes up for it - service trumps all. I also have no quarrel at all with their cash policy. It isn't as if Randy's is pretentious. I wouldn't compare lunch and dinner here to home cooked food, unless you expect food overcooked, and a great deal of the home pantry to be filled with processed ingredients.

After such great breakfasts, I was seriously let down by the rest of the menu.  I'll continue to return for the things that I love, and leave it at breakfast."}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times but about a year ago I started asking for Debbie. She is so sweet and she always remembers my friends order....he orders the same thing, I mix it up. Today was no different. We walked in,  got seated immediately and Debbie gets our drinks out right away and takes our order. My friends had bacon and eggs which is always good and I had a polish skillet. Everything came out fast and hot. I just love it here and the staff really looks like they enjoy their jobs!"}
{"text":"Amazingly wide selection of options!  Decent enough quality, fastest enough for lunch, relativly affordable for the area."}
{"text":"Surprised by the modest prices on the menu and for once in a long time I felt like I was dining in the past, especially with the sincerely friendly service.  Decor was dated too but clean and comforting.  I just felt right away that I was in a very welcoming place for some good diner food.  For the first time in awhile it felt like my server was someone who enjoyed working as a server, meeting people, and we felt like our business was actually appreciated.  Wow, novelty.  

I looked for an explanation for why it was too good to be true, perhaps it was because it was a slower period between breakfast and lunch on a weekday.  Food was served very hot, fast, and was good for breakfast diner food. The check was so low that I couldn't just leave the standard % range because it would have been insufficient.  Cash only place, and will surely go here again for a nice two egg breakfast with friendly service."}
{"text":"Great food here. What's even more wonderful are all the smiles on every single waitress in this clean little diner. 

Finished lunch with a huge scoop of ice cream!!

First time here but we'll be back."}
{"text":"I love Randy's so much I have them on speed dial.  It's the perfect stop on the way to work for good old fashion breakfast. Nothing fancy, however the food is homemade with no short cuts and delicious. How did Drive Inn's, Diners and Dives miss this gold mine? This place is an institution.  
My fav's are: 
Breakfast  : # 5  1/2 order of French toast , eggs, 1 bacon and 1 sausage link for $4.75
# 15  1/2 waffle  , eggs, 1 bacon and 1 sausage link for $4.75
Banana Pancakes and the breakfast sandwich is good too. 
Lunch: 
Lasagna is made with homemade sauce and perfect portions of ricotta. Served with garlic bread and a fresh green salad.
Note to self: I need to go for lunch more often."}
{"text":"A Dear John letter to Randy's.

Oh how I once loved you. Okay, maybe love is the wrong word, but I counted on you for consistency. For good breakfasts, decent prices and fast, fast service.

But Randy's, you've broken my heart. Not with the hair I found in my steak and eggs last Saturday but with your heartless, corporate policies. Randy's, remember the days when you were independent and cared about your reputation? Remember when the customer was usually right and when things went wrong that meant making it right?

Yes, I found a hair in my food. But I'm no prude. I realize that can happen anywhere. And does. But your refusal to do anything but replace the food sans hair is forcing me to leave you. Forever. Yes, I talked my feelings through with the waitress, then the manager, and then Randy himself. But my head shouldn't have to spin off my shoulders to get a $8 refunded to me and a meal replaced for the inconvenience of a hair in my food.

So I bid you a fond farewell, Randy's. I've had good meals and so-so meals in your humble restaurant, but I have to draw the line. And I'm drawing it at poor management. Love 'em or leave 'em the saying goes. And I'll be sure not to the let the door hit me in the bum on the way out.

Love, me."}
