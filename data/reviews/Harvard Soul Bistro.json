{"text":"It feels good to eat in my neighborhood with good tender tasty food owned by black owner with great customer service...I was really impressed i recommended 3 of my company's that I work for to come there to eat that's how good it is.. keep up the good work so we can get more business like this"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, kind and attentive service. Amazing food, everything from chicken and waffles to shrimp and grits or lobster tail. Mid range price."}
{"text":"The menu is pretty good. The food is okay. Just okay. The service is exactly what you would expect from a place on 200th next to a liquor store in the hood of Euclid. Hood mentality where nothing is their fault (including sending out the wrong food on a $110 Uber order....I mean totally wrong)."}
{"text":"I'm still not completely sold on this place yet. I had a lunch meeting there one day and the service was great. The food, not so much. We ordered the Cajun Rolls and Fried Broccoli first. The rolls were overcooked and the broccoli had too much batter on it. Had it not been for the excessive batter they actually would've been awesome.  For my entree I ordered the Fried Perch which once again had too much batter on it and it had no taste.   The next day I decided I'd give it another try. This time I ordered wings, Alfredo and broccoli (which the girl forgot to write down so I didn't get). The Alfredo was very bland, even my kids didn't like it. I like the fact that they use penne noodles but there was just no taste at all. The wings were okay, next time I'll get them naked.   I'll give this place one more shot before I write it off totally. I'll be sure to update my review when I do."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service is so so. The Sunday Brunch  they offer for 21.95 IS NOT WORTH IT AT ALL. Please don't come here if you are excited for the Sunday brunch. We were a table of four and had to wait about 30 minutes for the food to come out but not the waffles. The waffles  came out sooner. When all the food came out everyone's food was cold. They also do not bring individual plates for the waffles. They bring four waffles on one platter at a time for the whole table. The waffles did not taste fresh and the syrup was not maple syrup. The grits were not smooth but gritty.  I usually don't write reviews but this place is not worth the TIME or MONEY.  Please stay home and cook or find another place."}
{"text":"Terrible or worse Service what service.the fries are only thing good Yikes what a mess.no diet pop. No bar b q ribs.what a joke"}
{"text":"I came to this place as a recommendation, but omg its a slow Tuesday and the service is sooooo slow! We got here and our food didn't come until an hour later, we were on a crunch time after that and couldn't sit and enjoy our food we had to take it away to catch a movie and I swear the waiter had no urgency. The food was good the drinks are great but the service is just slow."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Service is terrible and slow. When I order on Uber Eats, they ALWAYS get the order wrong. When I dine in, it takes almost an hour. Food is good which is the only reason why I come back on the rare occasions that I do. Other than that, the service is absolutely terrible. So don't expect much from this place!"}
{"text":"The food was seasoned well but the service was HORRIBLE. It took over an hour to receive our order (only after I asked what the hold up was), and the restaurant wasn't packed at the time. Our drinks weren't refilled until we received the check. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my husband and it was my first time here. I'm giving it four stars for many reasons... 1)it's a cute little place close to home 2)it looked really clean on the inside and there wasn't any weird odors when we walked in 3) as soon as we walked in the bartender aknowledged we were there 4) the staff was super nice. my husband had mentioned that his beer was a little warm and they immediately fixed the issue 5) the food was really good! The wait was a little long but it was worth it being that dinner came out great! My husband got the snapper and I got their chicken tenders and we both really enjoyed our food and the price was really good for the amount of food we got. 6) the staff was really nice and friendly   I will be going back here again for sure!"}
{"text":"This place has good food but bad service. My wife and I routinely get food from this restaurant on UberEATS (I recommend the Cajun Chicken Rolls and the Chicken and Waffles). Yesterday was the first time I had ever went into the restaurant. I had seen the previous reviews about service issues, but I made an effort to go in with an open mind. My sister and I sat at the bar and were immediately greeted and given a glass of water by the bartender. After giving us table settings and menus however, the bartender left the bar area and did not return for a solid 15 minutes. Once she did return, she did not even attempt to excuse her absence, instead asking us what we would like to order. I ordered a chicken and waffles (my favorite) and a drink called the \"Bourbon St\". My sister ordered the cajun chicken rolls, greens, mac & cheese, and a house sangria. After 5 minutes of stirring about around the bar, the bartender put together my sister's drink (she liked it). After another 7 minutes (and returning to me twice to ask what I ordered, at which point I showed her the ingredients on the menu) the bartender put together my drink (I liked it). After another 20 minutes, the food came (we enjoyed the food). After finishing our meal, I had to find another staff member to get a box for what we were taking and to get the bartender to come back and give us the check. The meal totaled just over $50. All in all, I can confirm the service issues that other reviews have mentioned. The place was not busy at the time (roughly 6 customers when we arrived). If I owned this place, I would be especially concerned with the bartending staff not being present at the bar. For any restaurant, the bar is where a lot of profit should be made (provided service is fast and efficient). I know we would have ordered more drinks if we would have gotten timely service."}
{"text":"I ordered from here today my total was 30$ two crabcakes ,Mac&cheese and battered mushrooms and peach cobbler rolls it was horrible! Seemed like leftovers over cooked and flavorless I would not recommend"}
{"text":"My one daughter raved for 2 weeks about this being her new neighborhood go to spot.  I finally decided to go this past Sunday.  The prices seem a little steep for the menu that they carried.  I ordered the crab cakes as an appetizer & chicken Marsala for my entree.  The crab cakes were salty & tasted pre fab.  The cake texture was mushy.  For $12 I expected some chunks of crab somewhere.  The entree consisted of a thin grilled chicken breast that was tough and over cooked covered in Marsala sauce.  The Marsala was a thick gooey sauce almost the consistency of syrup.  The sides tasted like they came from a can or box mix.  I'll have to find out what my daughter ordered and perhaps give it one more try.  The lady across from me had turkey ribs that looked really good."}
{"text":"Just an ok experience. I ordered the chicken and waffles. Being this is a Soul food place, I expected a chicken wing(s), or leg piece. Even part of a thigh or breast, that was freshly seasoned and battered. Not strips that where it seems like you can get from a distributor like Sysco or GFS and some parsley sprinkle  on it .  The waffle itself was on the greasy side (not buttery ).  To be honest, it looked good, but for the price, it was a big let down."}
{"text":"The food is good, but prepare for a very long wait even if it's not very crowded. The cooks are reeeeeaaaalll slow. We waited for our food once for about 40 minutes after we sat at the bar for a to go order. Make sure you're not super hungry if you come here."}
