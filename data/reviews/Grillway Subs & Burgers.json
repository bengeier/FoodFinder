{"text":"Imagine you are driving around Bloor West Village or the Junction and are looking for a quick lunch spot to satisfy your hunger. You drive past a small storefront with a sign that reads \"Grillway\". Stop immediately, turn around, and go inside!

You will not be disappointed. This place has character, a charming owner, and some of the best souvlaki I've ever had. I usually order the chicken souvlaki on a pita, the chicken souvlaki dinner, or the chicken souvlaki with a Greek salad. Any one of the options are stellar! Great value for the food and everything tastes fantastic!

In addition to lunch, both the breakfast and dinner options are great! The place is constantly packed with locals looking to grab a quick meal. One of my favorite quick meals in the city! Above all, the food tastes great, you can't go wrong with a meal from Grillway!"}
{"text":"Burger was good .

Everything else is overpriced 

14 for a chicken dinner ?? Come on

50 cent debit fee

Only the police can afford to buy there"}
{"text":"Love their pizza, so much better than the big brands! I just wish they deliver, but still worth making the drive to pickup yourself. Also a fan of oven toasted turkey bacon sub, made with real bacon (not the thin microwaved stuff). I found most items priced comparable to the chain restaurants. I just wish the fries and the burgers were homemade and not bought then cooked from frozen."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in the city.  Amazing family owned customer service.  I highly recommend the banquet burger.  Don't forget to try the espresso"}
{"text":"Love this place. One of the best of the last remaining Greek diners. Hidden on Annette street at Runnymede this place serves almost everything, and everything always taste great. If you dare, try the Super sub. The pizzas are great too. 
My preference is their classic home burger. Huge, handmade, loaded with flavour, and char broiled just right. Fresh a la cart topping and a fresh bun. Burger goodness, way better than greasy jumbo burgers, and better than most in the city."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Best burger in town!!!! the pizzas are also great!! The owners are people with big hearts and the service is fun. Just try it and you will love it. The Banquet Burger is my favorite."}
{"text":"Owner is very friendly. Food is cheap and very tasty. What more could you want? Their pizza, hamburgers and poutine are especially delicious, and are all very generously portioned."}
{"text":"The food is average (burger above average). But my goodness their prices are fair! They could almost be raised, but that would lower my review"}
{"text":"Great burgers and tasty souvlaki. The breakfast is also very tasty, always served with a salad. Deifinitely a recommended place to eat."}
{"text":"Love this place, they always make you feel right at home and so welcomed when you come.
The chicken solvaki dinner is always so fresh and delicious. The prices are good for the portions. 
Definitely my go to place."}
{"text":"the fries are great, which is what I'm basing my rating on!  As for the owners (Greek) - the husband is very friendly, smiles and professional.  As for his wife, she is a real B@#%^.  She always looks misreable as hell and cranky!  If she doesn't like dealing with people where the hospitality business requires it, she should look for a job cleaning toilets, so she doesn't have to deal with people.  Let public toilet bowl cleaning wages pay her mortgage!  If it were not for her husband, I would never go back there!  If i were rating that aspect, I would rate it an \"Eek! Methinks not (1 star)\".
THANK GOODNESS FOR HIS PROFESSIONAL dispostion.  He needs all of it that he can get dealing with her by his side day in and day out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Maybe I am biased because I live across the street, but I don't think so. It's really that good.

Pizza is amazing. 10 bucks for a large? Perfect. They also never hesitate when I ask them to do crazy shit like sub out tomato sauce for BBQ sauce or cook my pie well done.

Burgers are great, and HUGE. Poutine isn't my favorite, but it sure does the trick on a hungover Sunday afternoon. 

Breakfast sandwiches are also great, as are the subs and the souvlaki. I honestly don't think there is a better mom n' pop shop in the city. The portions and prices can't be beat, and the service is always friendly and quick. I always call in my orders ahead of time and I've never had to wait once I've arrived to pick up."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place is so popular. The food is fine (at best) if you're in a pinch, but not quality. Nothing is made in house, and the price point doesn't reflect that at all. It's a good spot for an easy meal but there are better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever had! And the fries and gravy are awesome. The pizza ingredients are fresh and plenty. I've been going here for years and I have never had a less than pleasant experience. The couple that runs it is very friendly and welcoming. You can call ahead and the order is waiting when you arrive."}
{"text":"Food is great but if you don't pay attention you might get over charged.  Once I was charged double for one sub.  Luckily I noticed in time and the charge was taken off my bill."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place.  Extremely slow service.  Doesn't matter if you call ahead for pickup, they always make you wait.  Food is ok.  Service is bad.  Last time they overcharged me as well (didn't realize until it was too late) so be careful."}
{"text":"Excellent neighbourhood diner.  I get the pork souvlaki every time and never disappointed.  Nice big portions and friendly service. This place along with the Detroit Eatery on the Danforth are my two favourite diners in the city, and both are Greek! Go figure."}
{"text":"Real good. Never really had an appreciation for submarines until I had their 6$ foot long assorted cold cut. Also got the banquet burger (a bit pricy but good) and a poutine. It was a bit salty but not bad.

Will come back for late night eats for their subs!"}
{"text":"Looking for Greek takeout and thought I'd give this place a go. Friendly service and about 10 minutes for preparation after ordering. The food itself was very good and portion nice. Packaging was sturdy and food presented neatly. The cook really took care and pride in the meal. Leftover will make a nice lunch for tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I am a total fan of this place.

I just moved to this neighbourhood, decided to try the sandwiches here and really, this place is a gem. Super fresh ingredients, good portions, more than reasonable price, amazing sandwiches and the best part is the service: super welcoming, nice, always greeting you with a smile.

I will for sure come back, and regularly =)

Edited: the poutine and the chicken souvlaki hot subs are out of this world. My favorite in Toronto so far :)"}
{"text":"I really like this place! It has the look of a classic diner. The deals are well worth the money u pay. Portions are a substantial size and are quickly made. It has a very friendly atmosphere, where it feels like everyone knows everyone.,"}
{"text":"While the food is tasty here (I really enjoy the poutine and pizza), the best part is the service. 

I am always greeted with smiles and asked how I am doing.

The stand out moment for me at this place was a number of years back in middle school. My friends and I would often venture along Annette or Dundas during our lunch hour for some food. On this particular day, the cook (and owner, I believe) overheard my friend telling us he did not have money for lunch. He asked my friend what he'd like and happily served him a box of fresh fries."}
{"text":"Old school style Greek diner. Not much to look at from the outside, and the interior doesn't get any better, but the prices are good and the food is above average. Really good subs, burgers and souvlaki meals. You'll regularly find cops and firefighters going out of their way to grab a bite here. The place is always filled with regulars. The owner is super friendly and will make you feel at home."}
{"text":"I used to live in Toronto and have had burgers all over the city. Now every time I come back I have to go back to GrillWay to get the best burger in town. The burgers are home made."}
{"text":"I think 3 stars is pretty appropriate.  It's an \"A-OK\" place.  I have no idea how Yelpers here can say that anything there is \"The best in Toronto\".  Or even the Junction/Bloor West.  Let's be honest.  It is a neighbourhood place for me, and I do go there once in a while due to convenience, price to portion size and service. And maybe nostalgic for some.  I'll give it to them, the service is friendly.   Really nice owners and workers.  Old school diner service.  Based on lunch specials for the students, proximity to the schools and ease of \"hanging out\", it gets busy during the week at lunch.   I usually have the burger or sub.  The burger tastes good as long as you pile on the fresh toppings and sauces. The subs are a better option then a Subway for sure.  Try the Souvlaki sub, as that's my preferred one. Pair either with a Greek salad, and it's better. I tried the poutine once, and found it too salty.  Probably the gravy.   Fries are not my fave.  They are the battered crispy store bought fries you can find at any grocery chain.  With old diners, i would at least expect the fries to be made daily from freshly cut potatoes.  It's one of the easiest/cheapest things to do.  Especially if you have one of those french fry cutters.  Tasted the pizza and I probably won't buy again. I am a bit picky about my burgers and pizza, and after tasting the best that Toronto has to offer of each, my standards are pretty high these days.  It's traditional Greek diner food that excels at some things to be slightly above avg (Souvlaki Sub) to slightly below (fries/gravy/pizza) for me.  It would deserve another half star if they made their fries from regular potatoes like most old school diners, and at least made burgers from freshly ground and never frozen chuck that was cooked on a flat top.  I'd be happy to give it close to 4.5 stars just based on those two changes.  And maybe another half star if they replaced their bread.   If they had fresh egg buns, kaisers or sub bread, it would elevate all the food.  Any case, I guess the formula is okay for them as people seem to be going.  And I guess it keeps the lights on.  So, i'll give it what it deserves, including occasional visits when I need a change from the better options in the neighbourhood.  But I'm glad they are there instead of a huge franchise."}
{"text":"Really good, but their poutine is too salty.  I think it might be the gravy.  The fries are amazing though."}
{"text":"What a nostalgic little place. Cute diner reminiscent of days past, except with wifi!

Stopped in today for the first time and ordered a pizza. It was very fresh and delicious. This will be my new go-to for takeout pizza from now on.  You can't beat the price. 

The menu is very extensive. Lots of people coming in for takeout - burgers, subs, souvlaki, etc. The owner greeted everyone graciously and you could tell by the conversation several diners were regulars and knew him well. 

There were crumbs on our table when we sat down but he came over to wipe it down shortly after. The place seemed clean enough to me. 

We will definitely be back for breakfast or a quick bite sometime soon!"}
{"text":"The old man behind the counter is rude. Today was last time we went there, after having to wait for an extended amount of time to make an order. Not doing business with them, again."}
{"text":"The best burgers in town...and now they are opening a second location in my neighborhood , on bloor st west! Sooo happy!"}
{"text":"Definitely a diner.  

Imagine a cross between a coffee shop and a sub shop and this nails the decor.  But don't let that fool ya.  It's got personality and the food has flavour.  Key in a diner.  I had the luxury of having the burger with fries.  The burger was juicy and you could taste the honest beef flavour.  No filler, just beef.  Could be more then a three, but need more data to access.  

The place is set up perfectly for a quick tastee bite.  Make sure you drop buy the owners are really friendly."}
{"text":"Didn't have high expectations going in but was surprisingly busy. Simple diner feel with lots of menu options."}
{"text":"Full Disclosure.  I am a High School Teacher.

For the last three years, I have had students walk into my third period class.  I ask then, \"Where were you?\" They respond, \"Sorry sir.  I was at Grillway.\"

For three years there was a constant stream of late students walking far too far from the school to order burgers, poutine, pizza, and just about everything else you could imagine. 

I never sought out this Grillway.  I didn't even know where it was located.  Part of me assumed it was just an excuse students used, and knew would get them slightly less ire.  Who can blame the students for getting lunch, you see.

But - all of this changed.  Last weekend I was wandering down around Annette, and spotted \"Grillway\" on a restaurant, as I prepared to jump on the Runneymede bus.  Finally, after all these years of hearing about it - this great white whale of an eatery - I was there.

Stepping back from the curb, as the bus rolled up, I changed my plans, headed across the street, and stepped inside.

The restaurant is overpowering, in the way a Chinese restaurant can be.  There is no menu with four or five options.  No, instead, the entire restaurant is the menu.  Dozens of options present themselves - and as I scanned the room for something that would help me break through the mass of potentially delicious items, I zeroed in on the peameal bacon sandwich. 

My expectations were high.  I am a great loved of peameal bacon sandwiches, and expect nothing but the best.  As I waited for the bacon to cook, I started to fear - what if the meal wasn't everything I wanted?  Why had I sought out bacon in the west end?  Everyone knows it's the best out east!

But then it arrived - thick, plentiful slabs, on a huge kaiser.  Fresh vegetables, including slices of tomato that complemented rather than detracting from the overall experience.

As I bit into my six dollar sandwich, I realized there was nothing to fear.  And finally - at last - I understood why lunch hour, after lunch hour, my students made the pilgrimage to this intersection.

Looking around, I knew I'd be back - and that there would be all number of options waiting for me when I returned.

Just as I was leaving I heard something else.  Someone ordered the breakfast.

There is no breakfast on the menu.  But there are things that have potato, bacon, and eggs.  Clearly this is a restaurant with secret options, and that will make whatever you want if they have the ingredients on hand.

I am but a novice explorer - a green horn - in this land.  But I someday hope to become an expert.  Perhaps even a studied guide."}
{"text":"their lamb souvlaki is so tender and tasty!, Fresh ingredients, huge portions, amazing service. Can't ask for better."}
{"text":"Great food. Generous portions, lots of options, lots of typos on the old school menus above the food prep area. They have wifi and are expanding into desserts too. Chris, the owner, is a great guy as is his wife Tessie. Rough around the edges? You betcha. But all part of the charm! Recommended for sure."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since 2006 and this place has been run by the same hardworking couple. It's an always busy little diner that serves all day breakfast, souvlaki, burgers and pretty much EVERYTHING. YES EVERYTHING! 
We usually get the souvlaki skewer on a Greek salad with a side of fries. It is absolutely delicious. 
We have also had their burgers which are really nice - the bread that they use makes it taste so good. Additionally, they are very liberal with the toppings. 
I have to talk about the fries - their fries are crunch on the outside and sooo soft on the inside. When I think of how I like my fries - I think of the Grillway fry. 
You don't need any gravy with these fries but if you do, get it on the side. It will just make your fries soggy if you get it on top. 
Their breakfasts are great on the go and all their stuff is well priced and quite inexpensive. 
On this occasion we were craving a hoagie and even though they call it a sub, it is probably the closest thing to a hoagie that you will ever get in Toronto. Of course we got a side of Greek salad and fries!! 
Ps. The sandwich was soooo good. 
The food service area is really clean. This makes me happy!
Going back.... again and again!"}
{"text":"Certainly a warm and welcoming atmosphere at this place. The owner guy is indeed grateful for the business, which is even more impressive considering how busy it was.

I just had an assorted sub, which was probably a 3.5/5, though I would come back to try other items. 

Prices could be a bit more competitive"}
