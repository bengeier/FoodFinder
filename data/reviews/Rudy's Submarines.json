{"text":"I'm from Philly so I know what a cheesesteak should taste like. Well when I ordered mines from this place I was not expecting it to taste this good. My boyfriend and I split one in half & I wish I didn't because I wanted the other half. And to me what a plus was they had white American cheese & that's what we use on our cheesesteaks at home. Honestly I wish I would have taken a picture to show what the food looked like but I ate it too fast. The wings & fries are good too."}
{"text":"We moved to the area not to long ago and decided to try some places close by. We tried triangle and it was fantastic, but decided to go for Rudys this time because it was closer. Terrible mistake!   1. We got 2 chicken phillys and a order of cheese fries. The subs were the blandest thing I have ever ate. It was gross.   2. Our food took 30 min to get done (we were the only ones in there).  3.We got double charged for the fries. They had switched shifts and refused to believe that I already paid for the fries (didn't bother checking at all).  Stay far away!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here while on a previous business outing in the area.  It's another one of those no frills, no surprises places that's got good solid food.  I remember the chicken Italian hoagie here and how it was maybe two steps above what you get at Subway."}
{"text":"We live in the area and have ordered from Rudy's Subs for years. We take out if we do at all. I don't care to sit inside. They do offer plenty of seating if you choose to.  It can be a hit or miss at times, over the years I have been overly disappointed. The standards in food preparation and quality have diminished over the years. It is extremely expensive for what you receive. All bun and little meat. I wouldn't mind paying extra for the quality, but it is not there. Go to the Rudy's Subs on route 22 in Monroeville. I didn't take a picture of the sub, I was so discussed I threw it out. Will not return."}

{"text":"Braddock Hills sub shop shut down  May 7, 2016 8:13 AM Pittsburgh Post-Gazette The Braddock Hills restaurant Rudy's Submarines has been ordered closed following a series of violations, the Allegheny County Health Department announced this morning.  On Thursday, the restaurant's health permit was suspended because it lacked a certified food protection manager, had neither a handwashing sink in the food preparation area nor hot water and soap, and had no date-marking equipment. Counters were not properly cleaned and sanitized, and the floor and ceiling were in poor condition, according to the Health Department.  On Friday, the Yost Boulevard eatery was found to be operating in spite of the closure order. So a second order has been issued, and a red closure placard placed on the front door."}
{"text":"Smoke a J, go to Rudy's, get a big juicy tender made to perfection sub............ Enough to make anyone horny"}
{"text":"This place has great food but horrible employees. On more than one occasion I have called in an order and drove to pick it up only to be told that I ordered something else.   The last time it happened I ordered 2 cheeseburger subs and 2 fries (the usual). The lady working informed me that I ordered 2 philly cheesesteaks. She said she refused to correct the order and demanded that I paid for the food I did not order. I walked out.   It also doesn't help that this place has had issues passing their health inspections."}
{"text":"What a great place for a sandwich. We get the mushroom cheese steak with egg. Awesome. Better than anywhere. The place has a charm about it. Food is excellent. The food is what it's all about, right?  Go there you will make it a regular stop."}
{"text":"Really old place, even the people who grew up nearby can't remember when they opened. It could use a make over, but honestly they are doing everything else right so really who cares - the steak and egg sandwiches are amazing. Get the small, its still enough for 2 people. Every time I go to Pittsburgh I have lunch here as often as possible. I've even managed to eat lunch twice on a few occasions!"}
