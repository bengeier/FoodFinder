{"text":"Well this is the worst restaurant I've eaten at in years.  Horrible service, horrible food.  We ordered beef kebabs with rice wth vegetables which is standard fare for a middle eastern restaurant.  It took a looooong time to get our 'food' and what we received were 2 dried out kebabs with french fries, and the veggies consisted of canned mushrooms and tomatoes.  We did order 2 meals but only received one. When the owner/manager asked how the food was I asked him about the french fries and he said they didn't have any rice.  Never again."}

{"text":"Very, very good restaurant that's very, very poorly-named.  Who would expect a place called \"Bon Appetit\" to serve Middle Eastern cuisine that's Glatt Kosher?  I went with a friend and since it was our first visit, we decided on a lunch of 4 shared appetizers so we could sample the menu.  Good call.  Hummus was excellent, and perfectly garlicky.  Falafel was really, really good.  Served with pita bread that was both crispy and soft at the same time -- how did they do that?  Pelmeni (beef dumpling) soup was like nothing I've had before, almost Eastern European; rich without being overfilling.  Shwarma was very good, if maybe a little overloaded with diced tomato.  The only downside was indifferent service, even though we were literally the only ones in the place for 60 minutes.  I hope they attract more customers, because it's a great spot."}
