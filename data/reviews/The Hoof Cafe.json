{"text":"My friend and I happily feasted three mains and an appetizer. That's not to say that the portion sizes aren't generous - because they are! It was just that good. Instead of picking two out of three entrees that we really wanted, we just tacked on another plate. You gotta make the visit count, right?  Excited to Hoof-it-up, I got there a bit early and was surprised to find a line quickly gather behind me. Luckily, I was relaxing on the bench & enjoying the Sunday morning otherwise I wouldn't have gotten a table (not that the bar would've been bad). By 9:45AM, quite a few fellow brunchers were eagerly peering through the window in anticipation of the 10AM opening time.  The cafe itself is quite small, so go early if you want to avoid a wait or would prefer a seat by the window. Similarly, I arrived at Black Hoof right when they opened at 6PM, and just managed to grab a table. I wouldn't mind sitting at the bar though, they have fantastic cocktails and the service is jovial and chatty. However, for a group of more than 3 people a table is clearly better.  Bone Marrow Strawberry Beignets Winning Combination: Cinnamon, Sugar, Bone Marrow, Strawberries & Long Peppers These delicious little bone marrow pastries are coated in sugar and cinnamon. The donuts were hot, fresh, and filled with a sweet strawberry and long pepper jelly. Deep fried bits of joy, these were the perfect size and a tasty $5 appetizer. More please! The two other starters are currently available for $5; a pastry filled with bacon as well as ribs in a beer sauce. While curious about the others, these donuts were a winning choice. Well...honestly based on the entire meal, I'm convinced that anything would be a solid option!  Beef Tongue Grilled Cheese When I spotted this on the menu, succulent memories of Beef Tongue on Brioche from Black Hoof wafted through my mind. Slathered and fried, the buttery bread had toasty grill marks and neatly sandwiched an extremely tender and generous portion of beef tongue. I needed to erase the disaster that was Friday's T&T's rubbery beef tongue from my mind and this just blew it away. Hello satisfaction. Packed with comforting flavour, every bite made me stop to savour the combination of Provolone, Brie, crispy-buttery bread, and amazing thinly-shaved beef tongue. The little piggy-skewer with 4 pickles was a nice touch, similar to Black Hoof's Beef Tongue on Brioche Sandwich. Between the two, I'd say that this was better...but trust me...they are both delicious. Not bad for my first grilled cheese sandwich!  Suckling Pig Eggs Benny Perfectly runny egg yolks, light Hollandaise sauce over pickled jalapeño The Eggs Benny was perfectly poached. Warm yolk slowly oozed out when pierced with a fork, and every bite was covered in heavenly Hollandaise sauce. The sauce wasn't too rich, and did not mask the wonderful porky flavour on top of the fresh biscuit. The suckling pig had a barbecue flavour, and reminded me of very tender pulled pork without the sauce. The arugula had a lemony zip and the dish was surrounded by pork rinds. I could be wrong, but the rinds tasted like they were made a bit earlier as they were a bit soft rather than hot and crispy. They were spiced with barbecue powder. While a nice touch, I didn't care so much for them. I recently told a friend that my next food-hunt would be for Toronto's best Eggs Benedict. However, I'm pretty sure that now I've tasted this, there is no need. Even without the suckling pig, this eclipses all other Eggs Benny dishes I've ever had.  Brioche French Toast with Foie Gras O-M-G. I could easily leave the description as that, because that is all that was running through my mind when we received it, while I was eating it, and after it was done. The Brioche French Toast was perfect - the thick French bread was perfectly battered & fried, covered in sweet-syrupy goodness, roasted macadamia nuts, a dollop of creme fraiche, and bright red strawberries. Oh, and quite possibly the largest serving of Foie Gras that I've ever seen i my life. Words can't describe how great I thought it was - sweet syrup, hot fresh brioche, seared Foie Gras, macadamia nuts, creme fraiche, and fruit. How could this not be amazing?! Now I want every restaurant to start making French Toast with brioche. Like the Eggs Benny, this wins the C&T prize for Toronto's Best French Toast. Sorry Kalendar, but your banana & mango stuffed French toast was just trumped BIG TIME. A $26 plate French Toast might sound quite steep (it's $12 for the French Toast and $14 for the Foie Gras) but I definitely think that it's worth a try at least once. Go with a few friends and split it if you need to... Everything about the the meal was great. From the upbeat and friendly service to the colours and presentation of each plate.

{"text":"Foie Gras french toast was absolutely amazing.  Foie was done very nicely, melt in your mouth goodness, on french toast which was not too sweet with some tart blueberries to cut through the richness.   Good thing I shared it because it t was just  very very rich.  The suckling pig benny was also very elicious, with what looked like pulled pork between the poached eggs and the scone on the bottom.     i have yet to try the beignets but I hear they're delicious"}
{"text":"They like to do everything a little differently here was what my server announced early on in the engagement.  They definitely do different.  The ambiance was very clean and fresh.  I felt like I was in a little kitchen in the countryside.  The restaurant really presents itself nicely and the staff are very friendly, energetic and charming.  The meal came out of the kitchen pretty quickly and was hot when it arrived.  The coffee was excellent and that OJ was freshly squeezed and delicious, I had a couple.  When we arrived it wasn't very busy with about 3 other patrons and 3 of us, it was a nice little groove.  Within 30 minutes about 7 more people arrived and it was pretty jammed.    Warning 1:  This place is not for the claustrophobic or anyone with overly energetic children.   Warning 2:  If you are adverse to trying 'different' meats', this place might be a good place for you to enjoy some drinks and a nice conversation.  The food was relatively unique, I had the 'suckling pig' pulled pork sandwich.  I was told that it was their version of eggs Benedict, with a bit of a twist.  My meal was tasty, but I don't think that I could get my head wrapped around the menu items, much less what was in my plate.  It was a little disturbing and quite honestly, left my stomach feeling a little jumpy after the meal, not sure if it was the food or the experience but I seriously almost didn't make it out of the restaurant.  The food was good and I ate most of it, it's just that I was a little nauseated afterward.    The two people with me had bacon and egger's, which seemed to be the most normalized meal on the menu at the time, so they went for it.  The server advised us that this was their \"attempt at the best  bacon and egg sandwich, ever...\",  and a good attempt BTW.  One of my guests enjoyed their meal immensely and the second one (12yrs old and on the verge of becoming a vegetarian) decided that he couldn't eat anything here.  I think it had to do with the menu board."}
{"text":"Looking forward to an encore performance!  I have read about this place quite a bit and my wife and I decided to take the plunge.  We didn't regret it whatsoever.  For drivers, its not easy to find street parking, but believe me, its well worth it.   Its a very tight, and quaint space but  its fashionable and hip-happening with a very rustic feel to it.  The staff are extremely friendly and very versed in their service at The Hoof Cafe.    Once we were seated, they poured us bottled still water and asked us for any other drinks.  You'd expect menu's but its actually on a chalkboard on the wall.  Our server got our coffee, and took our order for the signature Suckling Pork Benny, and the Brioche French Toast.  We actually asked our server which to go for, either the Brioche or the Waffles.  He just suggested that he'll describe them both, and see which we'd like to try.  He was very descriptive and you could tell, he has a food passion like many of us.   As for the Suckling Pork Benny, it doesn't require to be reviewed anymore.  All I can say is, after all the hype about it and reading numerous reviews, it definitely lives up to its reputation.  I highly suggest when eating it, to combine the arugula at the same time.  Delicious...  The Brioche French toast... it was very refined and perfectly sweet.  It was on the opposite end of the spectrum (to be expected) but still very well done.  The toast was just crispy enough on the outside and it had perfect colour to make you want to dig in.  The toppings were the perfect amount of sweetness.    I definitely cannot wait to sample all the other wonderful items that I watched other people enjoy.  Everything I saw looked amazing and everyone in the place was \"happy\" to say the least.  ;)  Why not 5 stars?  I'd actually do 4.5 only since its a tight squeeze."}
{"text":"I was really excited to eat here. Unfortunately, our 45 minute wait turned out to be more like an hour and a half, the service was terrible, and the food was mediocre at best while still being over-priced.  It was so much a waste of my time that I left hungry, went home, and made myself some real food that actually tasted good.  Do not go here."}
{"text":"Holy crapoli!   The best brunch I've ever had in my entire life.  Place is small so go early if you don't wanna wait too long. I got there at 10:30 am and had to wait 30 min.  Across the street diagonally is a coffee shop with amazing espresso called the communal mule. You can grab some coffee there while you wait.   What I ordered:   Donuts with bone marrow and jam filling.  Brioche French toast with foie gras (additional $14) that was drizzled in maple syrup and plump juicy blueberries.  Suckling Benny; a suckling pulled pork with poached egg and cheddar scone. The lemony greens that came with the Benny dish also added a nice refreshing touch to the meal.   If there's one place you need to try in Toronto it's here!"}
{"text":"I was a little worried about the food here as I'm not the most adventurous eater.  I did find the menu safe right off the bat so I knew I wouldn't be leaving hungry.  The place is really small and we were three so seating was a slight challenge had drinks at the bar and when we were ready to order we had a table so not too bad.  The place however doesn't look like it can accommodate groups over 4.    Service was friendly, efficient and knowledgeable.  Drinks and food were great.  We shared ribs, pork belly, sausage and peppers, the charcuterie board, ricotta balls, and bone marrow.  All were excellent and priced right.  The desserts were also excellent, rhubarb cheesecake, and a sundae.    Overall, we had a great experience, drinks were great, food was great, we left full and didn't make too much of a dent in the wallet.  We will now try Black Hoof across the street as we had a great experience here."}
{"text":"Brunch is the most overrated meal ever. You want me to pay double-digits and wait in the cold for over an hour on a weekend for a couple of eggs and some bread? Hell, no.  But brunch at The Hoof Cafe is not the tired egg-crap I see at every coffee shop and fine diner in town. After all, it's run by the same people behind The Black Hoof[1], the current darling of the hipster food-cognoscenti in Toronto. (And if you know me at all, you already know I can't STFU about their Raw Horse Sammy.) So when they do eggs Benny, pancakes, hash, and french toast, these dishes are every bit as interesting and inspired as what you'd find at its progenitor.   Two meat-loving Yelpers, Vivek S. and Anthony R. from Massachusetts, joined me on a weekday to avoid the Saturday and Sunday rush at The Hoof Cafe. As it was, most tables were filled by 1 p.m. so we perched ourselves on the stools at the bar and peppered the friendly bartender with questions about the food while she peppered the rims of our Caesar glasses.  FOOD Remember that old commercial where the guy smacks his forehead and says, \"I could've had a V8!\"? That's how I feel about the Hoof Caesar, The Hoof Cafe's rendition of the Canadian classic brunch cocktail. At $8, it's a bargain when you see how many hand-crafted ingredients go into it: Hoof Cafe's own pink-peppercorn-infused vodka, house hot sauce, and house-made Marmite syrup and pickled yellow string bean. With its bright, refreshing flavors and overall deliciousness, I could've had four more. Alas, I did not want to fall off my stool.  Grilled cheese with tongue ($14); it's funny how the cheese gets top billing in this sandwich because it's all about the tongue. Shaved paper-thin, each slice is tender and succulent. The thick buttery toast has a schmear of piquant grainy mustard on the meat side and smoky grill marks on the outside. The accompanying house-made pickle slices help cut through the richness of the meat, teasing me to go back for more of that irresistible tongue. Yes. I'm still talking about the sandwich.  A side of pork belly pastrami ($4) yielded five thick slabs of meat, alternating layers of delectable swine with sumptuous melt-in-your-mouth pig fat. I would swear off bacon if I could have this in its stead.    Pigtails and grits ($13) were served in a bowl with creamy grits on one side and a thick ragu of pigtail morsels on the other, crowned with a perfectly cooked sunnyside-up egg and scallion salad. I broke the yolk with my spoon, allowing it to anoint the rest of the dish. The thin scallion slices provided a welcome crunch and sharp contrast to the rest of the dish. With flavors that were comforting and familiar yet intriguing and haunting, this was my favorite dish of the meal.  A side of hock links ($4) had plump little sausages served with glazed baked beans and a frizzle of fried collard greens. Again, everything looked familiar but the preparation was so deft, I have a newfound appreciation for the humble baked legumes.  Now that I think about it, the dishes here are only a dollar or two more than the brunch items at every other place in town but the quality and creativity are unparalleled.   SERVICE Hip, young servers who are knowledgeable and without a soupçon of attitude.  VIBE An inviting interior of hipster shabby chic; as I looked around the small dining room I kept noticing new things: a chalkboard menu written in nice handwriting that is not overly neat; glass-paned cabinets that reveal liquor bottles and big canisters of infusions; a light fixture made of Mason jars.  BOTTOM LINE Brunch at every other place: listening to music on mono mode Brunch at The Hoof Cafe: listening to music on Dolby Digital  It's time to experience stunning quality (or whatever the fuck the Dolby slogan is). 5 stars. ======================== [1] See my review: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/black-hoof-toronto#hrid:kAd1Z3pQzAePWFzKZ0-LlA"}
{"text":"Aaah... it's Sunday morning... you wake up, the sun is shining, the birds are chirping, and you're hungry, so you decide you're going to have brunch today. You go to this Hoof Cafe place that you've heard so much about. Are you going to order jam and toast? bacon and eggs? pancakes? maybe some fruit and oatmeal? Nope, bone marrow beignets, foie gras topped waffles, pig ears, rabbit omelettes, and cow tongue grilled cheese sandwich bliss await you! There is nothing on their menu I would not recommend because it's all good... The quality and freshness of their ingredients are top notch and you won't find another brunch spot like this in TO. This is not a place to come to if you're worried about your cholestoral or vegan because there's nothing on the menu for you. If you're looking for rich, flavourful morsels of meat, then you've come to the right place!"}
{"text":"Dayyuuuuuum. I didn't think this strip of Dundas West could be this delicious.   The strength of the food is enough to make me look past the irregular hours (closed Wednesday/Thursday, and when they are open, they close from 4-6) and that the coffee always tastes off. My suspicion is that they use their espresso grinder for their French presses. Although there are coarse settings on espresso grinders, it'll be nowhere near the level needed to make decent coffee in a press. There is, however, an easy solution to this problem: skip the coffee. The specials also tend to be pretty interesting, and I've never had trouble getting a table, even though it tends to get pretty busy."}
{"text":"I eat a Paleo diet, and this place had some good options... I had suckling pig Benny and ploughmans platter.    Yummy"}
{"text":"Is it possible for food to be too intense?  If so, Hoof Cafe just might being serving it.  I was intrigued to see all the atypical animal parts going into their menu, so I knew I had to try this place before the end of my visit.  Bone marrow doughnuts: a pretty subtle flavour behind all the strawberry-doughnutty goodness. Tongue grilled cheese: a TON of tongue, wow. So thinly sliced, it's delectable.  and last but not least... Foie gras French toast: the BIGGEST piece of foie gras I've seen in my life. And I've seen my fair share of livers. And it melts like the best of them. The French toast is rich and subtly sweet. Plump blueberries and a pat of butter complete this totally extravagant dish. ($26.)  So rich, I couldn't finish it, even sharing with friends - and I seriously couldn't function for about 30 minutes after eating.  Next time, I'm trying the eggs Benedict!  Come with lots of time - we had an hour-long wait for Sunday brunch at noon, perfect for exploring the Portuguese Village beforehand. (They beckon you back via cellphone.)"}
{"text":"Been wanting to check out the black hoof restaurant for a while, but was super excited when I heard about te cafe as I am a huge fan of brunch.   I had the eggs Benny and was not dissapointed. The eggs where perfectly cooked and the flavour of the hollandaise was amazing. The pork rines on the salad where a nice touch. My gilrfriend had the buckwheat pancakes with rabbit and bacon. She wasn't a big fan as she likes her pancakes really sweet, I loved the mix of savory and sweat and thought it was reallly well executed.   Overall, the food and the atmoshpehere were great. They also took our number so we could go grab a coffe while we were waiting, which seems to be pretty common in this hood(pizzaria libretto also does this). Would definitely go back.   One thing to note, the plates are not huge, so don't go expecting a the type of brunch that keeps you full all day."}
{"text":"All the raving reviews on Yelp fueled my curiosity so when a friend came to visit we eagerly woke up early on a Sunday morning and made the journey to The Hoof Cafe. We arrived about 10-15 minutes before they opened and there were people lining up already! GASP!  I got the eggs benny and my friend had the salmon pita. Both were heavenly! The pulled pork on the eggs benny were OH SO TENDER and the hollandaise on the poached eggs were creamy but not too overpowering. The biscuit which they laid everything on was like a salty sable shortbread with soft centres. The arugula side salad with citrusy dressing was a really nice touch to clean the palette after the creamy and tender goodness of the eggs benny.   We washed everything down with some latte, which was also amazing.   Service was fast, which was a must since the place was packed full five minutes after they opened up for the day. Decor was simple and beautiful, an elegant yet relaxing atmosphere. The staff were quite hip, friendly, and efficient.   This is perhaps one of the few things I would wake up early on Sundays for."}
{"text":"Suckling pig benny was delicious.  Loved the fresh arugula with it.  Had the brioche French toast with plum jam, cream cheese and hazelnuts for dessert.  It was awesome.  Happy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Um, yes, it's worth the hype.   Do not be deterred by the line-up. It's worth it and goes by quickly - why not pop by nearby The Communal Mule for a coffee while you're whittling time away?  Brunch here was definitely one of those experiences that was all encompassing goodness - great service, great food, and an all around glowing atmosphere of happy brunching folks (over yolks!).  Recommend: Sit at the bar, and chat with the bartenders."}
{"text":"Took twenty minutes to drive here from king and bathurst because of a multitude of parades and lots of rain, we would not be deterred however, we were excited to see if all of the claims about this place being amazing were true.  THEY ARE!  We arrived at around 10:45 and were lucky to be seated almost immediately.   We ordered the french toast and eggs benny and split each. Both items were decadent. The eggs benny being perfectly balanced with the salty pork and incredible egg, hollandaise and biscuit. The french toast was savory, well cooked complimented the eggs perfectly.  Looking around at the other diners we saw some incredible dishes including the tongue grilled cheese and waffles. These are definitely on the \"to try\" list.  Prices are on the high side but the quality of the food makes up for it.  An excellent brunch spot, though it is tiny so expect a wait unless you are fortunate!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were the first customers of the day.  Having come from NYC, I didn't feel like this place was small or tight.  The dining area wasn't big but the tables were well spaced.    As for food, we had the goat yogurt with granola and the suckling pig benny (a.k.a. eggs benedict).  The goat yogurt had a consistency and taste closer to cheese than yogurt.  Paired with the granola (see picture posted), it was very delicious.  We shared it, but it would probably be enough for breakfast for one.    The eggs benny was also amazing.  I get eggs benedict at almost all breakfast places I try for the first time, and this was definitely up there with the best.  The portion wasn't extremely large, but it tasted great.  Also, their fresh squeezed grapefruit juice was very good."}
{"text":"Housemade sauerkraut +spaetzle, sausage, and two fried eggs with custom HP like sauce on side?  Brunch heaven. Better than you know what.   WAY BETTER."}
{"text":"Snap judgement:  Loved it.  We went there after having dinner at the Black Hoof across the street since they only had carrot cake for dessert.  Seriously, look for Peach Fritters on the menu board.  It's lip smacking good!  I'm talking about perfectly fried fritters with creme fresh, sorbet, and peach jam.  FYI, the best part of the dish lies on the bottom of the bowl.  Make sure you scoop that baby up and smother it all over your fritters.  One last thing, don't share it with anyone!"}
{"text":"Giddyup!  Having recently shared the pleasure of introducing Adeel \"Everything's bigger in Texas\" O. to Swiss Chalet, it was all the excuse I needed to finally hit the Hoof Café for brunch when Shari \"Afraid of a little tongue\" M. suggested we introduce him to something a little more exotic.  I've heard the lineups can be pretty heavy, and was not looking forward to arriving at 10AM just to get a seat.  The plan was to caffeinate en route, but Saturday morning being Saturday morning brains were left behind and we had to charge up once on site.  I was only mildly disappointed to learn that they serve espresso but not drip coffee.  No biggie; the Americano was just fine.  The place packed in pretty quickly behind us, so if you don't want to wait you'll have to suffer with the early hours.  I find myself griping regularly about the service standards at a lot of Toronto restaurants.  It's always nice to see exceptions to the rule, especially since even paying high-end-casual prices doesn't seem to guarantee any sort of professionalism anymore.  Service at the Hoof was top-notch - everything moved quickly and water (an essential with the kind of food we were getting into) was kept topped up.  It was especially nice not to get the \"do I have to?\" sigh when we bombarded the poor man with questions about the menu options.  This side of the experience no doubt coloured the rest of my experience, and I'm OK with that.  Try the donuts.  I had the beef tongue grilled cheese.  I was too excited about my first \"tongue experience\" to remember what kind of cheese, but I think it was Fontana.  Beef tongue is a very rich and sometimes tough cut; preparing it well requires a bit of know-how and these folks delivered.  It was brine-infused and tasted as though it had been sweet-pickled, like rich pastrami.  The meat was shaved thin, piled much higher than I expected, and the sandwich came topped with a couple gherkins for good measure.  The cheese added a deliciously creamy note to the whole thing and for a few minutes I was in heaven.  The Hoof Café isn't cheap, but it's accessible.   If you're not going for slabs of foie gras on your French toast, you'll make it out for less than you'd expect.  Get your ass out of bed and go try it."}
{"text":"If you are a cow and had a reason to die, it should be so you can be served at the Hoof Cafe.  This place is one of the most talked about brunch places for good reason.  It is a bit out of the way, but worth the trip.  We arrived around 1:30 pm on a Saturday and it was packed. The hostess was very helpful and took our phone number so she could call us when a table was available.  She recommended a few coffee shops in the area. Very helpful!   (insert non-descript coffee experience here)  The Hoof Cafe is warm and laid back.  All the servers are awesome and super friendly.  I had the Hoof Hash ($11).  I had high expectations which were totally met.  Potato bits with tender juicy cow tongue,  greens, combined with sauteed and deep-fried shallots accompanied with perfectly poached eggs.  I was practically licking my plate.  Each bite was a wonderful medley of flavors and textures.  My friend ordered a side of the pork belly pastrami.  It looked a lot like bacon, but softer, fattier,and more glamorous soaked in something that resembled maple syrup.  It melted in your mouth, salty and sweet perfection.  I enjoyed every minute of my meal here. I will come back for sure and I want to try that tongue grilled cheese that everyone likes so much."}
{"text":"The Hoof Cafe is a beautiful new restaurant open for brunch from 10-4, and for drinks till 2am. It is located directly across the street from The Black Hoof,  its site restaurant which it resembles so closely in both range of tastes and in terms of its general excellence.   The menu includes nods to many classic brunch items (eggs benedict, french toast, hash, pancakes and grilled cheese) but, of course, these are the same people who brought TO the amazing raw horse sammy, so, obviously these are not your standard items.  The eggs benny is made with suckling pig, and if you are going there for the first time, I cannot recommend this dish enough. Eggs are poached perfectly, hollandaise is perfect, pig is delicious and abundant and the english muffin is incredibly rich and matches the texture perfectly. Best benny in the city, hands down.   Hash is potatoes, onions and some wonderfully tender beef tongue served in a mild pepper sauce (?) and is wonderful, french toast is brioche with fois gras, and while I haven't tried it if it even approaches the current fois gras at Hoof prime (w/ Rutabaga) then it will be divine, Pancakes involve Rabbit, and the grill cheese involves tongue.   A question on the drinks: Is it really necessary to make pink peppercorn vodka that involves some sort of 62 day flavour infusing process just to make a Caesar? Answer: Apparently Fucking Yes.  There are a lot of good Caesars in Toronto, but I'd be willing to place odds on my not finding a better one than this: house-infused pink peppercorn vodka, marmite, worcestershire, tabasco (?), horseradish, a pickled  bean garnish and a great salt and cumin (?) rim. Not as 'different' as, say, the one at Ceili Cottage, but a perfect manifestation about everything I love about The Black Hoof and now Hoof Cafe: traditional without being predictable, involves an enormous amount of behind the scenes work to ensure control of quality, perfect in its execution, and, most importantly, was made with a genuine love of not only the food/drink itself, but also the experience of sharing it with an appreciative public.   I was in a restaurant in Ottawa (to remain unnamed) a few months ago where a good friend of mine is the chef. I had just gotten into town and hadn't called him yet, so I didn't bother looking in the kitchen to see if he was working and merely ordered my food. After I ate he happened to walk out and see me and later told me 'I wish you had told me you were here, I would have made sure you got an awesome meal'.   I don't know anyone who cooks at the Hoof or the Cafe, so this is just speculation, but I'm willing to bet this doesn't happen. The food *tastes* like every single dish that leaves the kitchen has been  prepped, cooked and plated with love for that one customer whose opinion matters more than the rest.  As such, I will return to both the Cafe, and its sister cross the way as often as I can afford it."}
{"text":"What's better than buttermilk fried chicken for breakfast?  Nothing.  Except maybe sticking a fresh belgian waffle under it.  Mmmmmm....  I've heard lots about The Hoof Cafe and took advantage of a day off from work to beat any line-ups.  At 10a.m. on a Friday morning there was only one other diner in the restaurant.  Our waitress told me about the special - 3 pieces of buttermilk fried chicken on a waffle served with some saucy onions.  I was sold.  I briefly looked at the chalkboard menu behind me, but stuck with my first choice.  I'm extremely glad I did.  I didn't think I had it in me to eat fried chicken for breakfast, and certainly not 3 pieces of it!  It was perfectly crispy on the outside (delicious batter) and hot and moist on the inside.  Surprisingly, it wasn't too greasy either.  The last buttermilk fried chicken I had was at The Stockyards, which I thought was pretty good.  The Hoof's chicken was far better.  The food seemed to take a while considering they weren't busy at the time.  But maybe I was just starving so it seemed like an eternity.  It took forever to get the bill, which always frustrates me.  When I want out, I want out.    Despite the slow service, I'm giving them 5 stars because I can still taste the deliciousness of the fried chicken now...  Mmmmm...  Oh, the waffle and saucy mixture were delcious too.  (Unimportant details compared to the BEST fried chicken I've ever had.)"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Among the best brunches that my wife and I have had anywhere (along with McKiernan's & Sparrow in Montreal).  Everything we've had was great, the service is solid.  Probably what I would recommend the most on the menu is the waffles and the tongue grilled cheese... yum!  Basically I'd call it a \"New York quality\" restaurant, meaning up there with what you could find in the West Village."}
{"text":"Jeez this place needs to Start Accepting Credit Cards and perhaps remove a table or two or get a bigger spot. A group of us went there for the Sunday brunch and it was slammed with a 45 min wait for us. We ended getting coffee at the cafe next door which turned out to be a nice surprise. I was looking to try the coffee at the Hoof Café since I saw the bag for my fav brand of coffee (49th Parallel Vancouver) First we were seated at the bar (who the heck seat a group of three on the bar!!) then we requested a seat at the table. In the meantime I bumped into someone's table and spilled some milk even though I was very careful but the space here so tight I am surprise the fire marshal hasn't shut them down for over crowding.  I decided to go with the French Toast with Foie Gras and side of bone marrow. A friend did the same while the 3rd in our part went with the Shrimp and Grits. After the somewhat long wait we got our food. The stuff looked great (will post pics later) the portion of Foie Gras was good (FYI they have increased the prices as the French Toast with Foie Gras was 27$) It was nice and rich with a generous dousing of Maple Syrup. My friend said the shrimp and grits were ok but the portion was small. I also left somewhat unfulfilled. This place is great for TO if you want to try something other than the mundane offerings in the city. three and half stars IMO."}
{"text":"We went on a monday afternoon, so there was no wait.  Ordered the suckling pig benny, brioche french toast with foie gras, and the calamari sammy. Everything was delicate, balanced, beautifully presented, and reallllllllllllly delicious!  The portions are a bit small, but then again, I was also having my first meal of the day, so maybe i was more hungry than usual.  Coffee was great too! Didn't get a chance to try their cocktails, but from the other reviews, their Cesar is suppose to be really good?!  The staff is super friendly n helpful. I had asked for some business cards before I left.( Mom wanted to hand them out to friends so they can all come n enjoy this place) They ran out of it so the waiter ran across the street to The Black Hoof (sister restaurant) to get us some.   Eager to try the Black Hoof soon!"}
{"text":"This small cafe is a revelation and a nice change of pace from the typical brunch fare you would expect.  If you've been to the Black Hoof across the street, which specializes in charcuterie, you'll have a good idea of what you'll be in for.  Two important things to mention:  i)  The place is very small and does not take reservations.  Be prepared to sit at the bar or have to wait a lengthy time for a table.  Luckily, they will take your cell phone number and you can go visit the numerous coffee shops around the area, including Ella's Uncle, Ezra's Pound, The Tampered Press and my personal fave, Communal Mule.  ii)  The highlight dish for me are the bone marrow donuts.  One of the top five things to have in Toronto.  Be warned that they are only served on weekends.  The service is always friendly and prompt.  Coffee is served French Press-style, a trend I hope becomes more and more prevalent.  Having been there a handful of times, I would recommend the suckling pig benny, which despite the title is really similar to a ham eggs benedict you'd get elsewhere.  What I am particular fond of though, if you have an appetite for it, is the french toast and foie gras.  The combination of the sweet and flavourful fruit syrup with the bitterness of the foie gras works perfectly and is really a terrific mix of tastes for your palette.  However, the top reason to come here is for the bone marrow donuts, served only on the weekend.  They come in a little pouch of six, with sugar sprinkled on top, served warm, with gooey deliciousness in the centre.    I will definitely be back, many, many times."}
{"text":"We went to Hoof Cafe as a precursor to our Black Hoof dinner experience http://www.yelp.ca/biz/black-hoof-toronto#hrid:RF1fzbAmQ25BLsrp3eIaPA while we waited for a table to be made available across the street.  Since they're owned by the same people anyway, we weren't too bothered by the wait.  In fact, it was a very tasty and heart-stopping start to the evening!  The selection of beers is very refreshing - my first taste of a Duggan beer!  The artisianal plate made up of charcuterie and cheese came with a complimentary bowl of warm crustini that we were able to refill, which is a bonus as bread is something that is to be paid for at Black Hoof.  The bone marrow was incredible and just enough for all five of us to each have one deliciously rich bite.    The service was quick and attentive.  When we received the call from Black Hoof that our table was ready, we were told that we had a bit of time (10 minutes) to finish up as they'll hold the table for us.  I can't wait to come back for brunch!"}
{"text":"How have I not been here prior to this day?! I mean, as a full fledged meatatarian, I am embarrassed to say I have never Black Hoof'd or Baby Hoof'd. It is a disgrace to meatatarians everywhere, and I profusely appologize.  With Adeel \"Toronto truly is my home\" O and Dale \"as an Economist\" M as my fellow meat worshippers, we endeavoured to The Hoof Cafe this fine morning when the joint opened.   We shared the bone marrow donuts, I had the suckling pig benny, and a latte.   I am not even going to attempt to write about how fabulous these items were. I feel complete silence is in order to truly capture, enjoy and digest the complexity and true awesomeness that is The Hoof Cafe.    *Silence is Golden*    Go....soon....but....get there before they open. Tight quarters. Friendly staff. Reasonable prices.   The Black Hoof is next on my list!"}
{"text":"This place is always billed with a Fear Factor element: tongue, bellies, brains, guts, etc. But for all the snout-to-tail fuss and fanfare, the menu is totally accessible for even a squeamish novice.   I went to this itsy-bitsy spot for brunch today, and it was as packed as everybody warned me it would be. But me+1 managed to get a table quickly and our service was spot-on. Perfectly prepared americanos, to-die-for suckling pig bennys, very good \"hay ham\" and  stellar baked beans.   I even liked the restrooms with reclaimed stainless kitchen sinks and doors that didn't really close.  Must go back for charcuterie."}
{"text":"This was the one place on the Toronto to-do list I made in California that I refused to miss.  So even though I was jet lagged and exhausted, I got up when my 8:00 wake up call rang the hotel room and proceeded to drag my sleepy boyfriend  out the door so we could get to the restaurant before 10:00 am in order to beat the crowds I was dreading on this particular Saturday morning.   And boy am I glad I did.  Hoof is a very cozy restaurant and several people were already lined up outside by the time we got there, about 10 minutes before the doors opened.  Once inside, there is a chalkboard listing the day's offerings.  We were so excited, we ended up ordering half the items on the board, all of which were wonderful.  Of special note is the pork belly pastrami.  My boyfriend says it is the best thing he has ever eaten, which says a lot.  Basically, this \"pastrami\" is bacon meets fatty pork belly fried ever so slightly crispy.  Two slices of this heavenly meat sits in a sweet reduction of maple syrup, suckling pig jus, and soy sauce.  I am dizzy with delight just thinking about it.  We also tried the bone marrow doughnuts that I had read so much about.  These are little doughnut hole sized balls with a texture similar to beignets with centers filled with vanilla, marrow and rhubarb.  These were rich but tangy and perfect starters for our brunch.  The toast with goat butter and rhubarb jam was the best toast I have ever had in my life.  The butter has a very delicate goat milk flavor which gives an added dimension to the butter which I found quite enjoyable.  If you are a good eater, you should also give the suckling pig eggs benedict a whirl.  The perfectly poached eggs sit atop succulent tender shredded pork that melts in your mouth.  The English muffin is obviously made at the restaurant and has a density that holds up well to the sauce and the egg yolk so you don't end up with the usual soggy mess.  If I lived within an hour of this restaurant, I would be there every weekend.  Fortunately for my waist line, Hoof is on the opposite coast, but I will always dream of having the opportunity to eat there again."}
{"text":"This is an ode to the wonderful glorious marvelous smells and taste of meat!   Upon opening the door to this intimate diner situated in what probably was a former local convenient store was the amazing flavours that hit me between the nose and eyes. I immediately went from having a pretty cruddy day to floating on the vapours of browned, fried, broiled animal sacrifice and it made me oh so happy.   We shared the pork ribs that had this familiar but indistinguishable dry rub. Immediately I think it's Asian, but not exactly. It had a bit of kick but you could taste the cayenne and what we could only guess as 5-spice or star anise or some kind of jerk rub.   We also had the Crispy beans and Crispy Salad. How can anything crispy go wrong? As long as it's not burnt, its great. If my salad was crispy every time, I'd have salad every day. Who says you can't make friends with Salad?   I LOVE duck. Quack! All kinds of duck, and the Duck Sammy, a duck sandwich was perfectly flavoured and oh so moist and mouth watering. Fortunately/unfortunately they had mixed up our order, and was extremely late with the duck, but they took care of it and didn't bill us for it. After the experience, I was almost going to ask them to add it back on the bill because it was worth it (but I didn't).   The place was packed, and the service was great.   I'm going back next week. Enough said?"}
{"text":"Have been back a couple times since the first outing and it still hasn't disappointed.  Their drink menu is fun and innovative.  Had the Basil Fawlty after a hard night of partying and it was the most refreshing drink ever.  Fairly strong too, cuz after just one I felt all warm and loopy again.  The BBQ ribs were different and fun, but not my favourite.  They de-boned and dusted them like chicken wings and served them in a paper bag.  Wish they had a sauce to dip into and it would've been an amazing finger food.   The Ox Croquette was AMAZING.  I had to share with 3 other people and we were all fighting for the tiny little morsels of deliciousness.  In such a small little ball, they managed to pack some intensely dark and rich flavours.  Still dreaming about them for sure.   Last but not least had the Ling Cod with creme fresh ramps.  The cod was well done and tasty, but for me the Ramps were superstars.  They had a really mellow creamy flavour that surprised me.    Yes this place is still awesome."}
{"text":"This is Black Hoof - the finale. As the curtain draws, I know that even if I scream encore the cast has gone into hiding and will reappear playing different roles in BHCo come spring.   Think autograph is to signature dishes at the Hoof. With the exception of a few dishes such as the Ploughman's and the Granola.... I have been lucky enough to have gotten \"autographed\" by he plethora of stars reigning from the Tongue Grilled Cheese to the unforgettable Pork Belly Pastrami (cue Nat King Cole).  We arrived at 9:30 in anticipation of  longer than normal waits...but surprisingly nabbed a spot at the bar in the first sitting. Yay!   We ordered the Bone Marrow, Pork Belly Pastrami, Spot Prawns and Grits, Hay Ham, Hoof Crepes, Tongue Grilled Cheese and Suckling Pork Benny.  The bone marrow fell short of what I expected from reading others' rave reviews. While it was an experience, I found it to be lacking in flavor of any kind but it was buttery goodness!   I have never tried grits before but I think I got the best first-hand experience...like never having been in an airplane before and flying first class the first time. It had a texture that was somewhere between a porridge and a potato puree. Very creamy! The eggs were a little overpoached for me as the egg whites were a bit rubbery in texture for my tastebuds. The BC prawns were a little smaller than what I was anticipating (as the barrista told me they were similar to tiger prawns and those are massive buggers). Nonetheless the shrimp had a certain oceanic freshness to them (albeit being a bit heavy in the salt). The sweetness of the pork belly pastrami bits which were accented with maple syrup balanced out the salty flavor of the dish.  So I can now say I have no regrets as I got to experience the Hoof Cafe during it's closing week.  Until we meet again..."}
{"text":"Come here for everything pig...  Haven't had breakfast here, and just reading the sad news from fellow Yelpers that there will be no more breakkie??!?!?!!?  No way!  I guess my review will just be of pre-appies and drinks whilst waiting for the BLACK HOOF....  They had very interesting drinks - I had a cocktail-name-i-dont-remember - but it was bourbon deliciousness and tarty sweet, but not to sweet, shaken to perfection with egg white?????  It was delicious, light and not too strong.  To share, we had the SERRANO HAM - this was the best.  They had the pork leg sitting on top of the counter and then thin slices were served onto the plate.  I love proscuitto-esque meat so this my idea of heaven.  We had the BBQ Pork Ribs, this was interesting - kind of like popcorn chicken packed with BBQ flavor.  It was small and bite size, smeared in BBQ and cajun spices, then lightly deep-fryed.  It was served with dipping mayo.  I really enjoyed it, but my co-pilot did not.  We had the ARTISANAL PLATE - it had a bunch variety on it that was delicious, seemed like a small version of the Hoof Cafe Charcuterie Plate but with more jams and such.  Delicious and served with bread...  Then off to the Black Hoof we went..."}
{"text":"Last meal ever at Hoof Cafe today before it goes to the deadpool *tear* Everyone walking out of the place was sad !!!!   Still one of the best (and fattiest) brunches I've ever had, but needs to be had at least once.   We went at 11:30 and told it was a two hour wait. After a smart decision, we got our computers and waited at the Common Mule. An hour later we got the well anticipated phone call to walk over!  Looking at the menu, it targets meat (especially pig) lovers, and may not be the best choice for non pork or meat eaters, but! you can still have something here if your company should want to go.   My only real comment is that they REALLY hiked up the price of the Brioche French Toast with Foie Gras. The french toast used to be $9 + foie gras = $14. Now it's $13 + foie grad = $27 !!! It looks the same.   On plus side is that you can now order a side of Bone Marrow for $8. Yummmm fatty goodness.   Today I had the Tongue Grilled Cheese - creamy, meaty, not to salty, fresh toasted egg bread.  My boyfriend had the prawns with cheddar baked grits. A bit on the oily side but oh so yummy.   Tips: around 1:30 this sunday, the crowd seemed to die down and lots of seats available.   IF you're looking for a brunch this wee/end COME HERE before it all closes down!"}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is hipster central! I'm not in that crowd but I thought it was fun to be in a place that's right out of the hipster playbook.  1. Poor A/C. 2. Overly small room with only a few tables 3. Tacky or very old fashioned decor 3. Eccentric staff 4. The waiter was wearing capri pants 5. Offal all over the menu  I moved to Ontario two years ago and this is the most creative meal I've had!  I had the Beef Tongue Grilled Cheese and my fiancee took the Eggs Benny.  Both were good but I think the Grilled Cheese was extra special.  It had such a great flavor. I asked the waiter what was in it and besides tongue he told me there was pork sausage as well.  Delicious!  A little pricey for brunch at about $40 for two people but worth it for the unique and tasty food. The french press coffee is a nice touch and completed the feeling of being in a hipster den."}
{"text":"Everyone said that I wouldn't enjoy this place (I avoid most meat, eating only seafood sparingly) But, there is a lot here for even vegetarians (if they can manage to ignore the pigs leg sitting over the bar)  The decor is stunning, the cheese plates are so well curated, and the cocktails are amazing. My mind was blown by the Basil Fawlty - a gin and tonic with fresh basil and a Python reference."}
{"text":"MEAT!!!  You've done it again!!!  I woke my fat ass up early on a Saturday morning to beat the crowd at the Hoof Cafe.  Got there about 10:10am and got the last table.  Phew.  I went there with a friend, who weighs in at about 90 lbs soak and wet, so naturally we thought that an app and three entrees would just the right amount of food for two lightweights.  Bad estimation on our end -- there was waaaay too much food!  First, order the donuts.  They're not on the menu.  You get six little mini-timbits full of bone marrow and jelly goodness.  A steal at $5.  The others:  1) Hoof Hash ($11) - had no idea until I read the review here that the meat in the hash was beef tongue.  I am even more amazed.  It was super tender and not overbearing or salty.  2) Suckling Pig Eggs Benny ($14 I think) - I hate that yellow goo that most places serve, but decided to give the hollandaise  a shot at the Hoof.  It was mild and not the buttery glop you get everywhere else.  The pig was at the pinnacle of its sucklingness and the rinds were a nice touch.  3) French Toast with Fois Gras ($23 with fois gras, $9 without) - Clearly I'm not an animal activist because I could really taste the inhumanity in this dish.  My motto is \"everything tastes better with fois gras\".  It's no different in French toast.  The combination of house made peanut butter, jelly, and honey mixed with the savory taste of fois gras was a symphony of taste in my mouth.  My favorite dish!   Overall, a great alternative spot for brunch, but not quite as good as the mighty flagship restaurant across the street.  Complaints?  Brunch for two came to $75+ tip.  It ended up being a $45 brunch a pop.  Ouch!"}
{"text":"Here are your instructions, if you choose to accept them:  1. Go to the Hoof Cafe. 2. Order one of everything. 3. if you can't order one of everything, at least order these things: -- a. the bone marrow beignets -- b. bone marrow -- c. pork belly pastrami 4. Enjoy them heartily, because you can now die happy.  Everything I tasted was amazing. In addition to the deliciousness above, I had the brioche french toast, and for something not topped with meat it was still amazing.   I have to really give special mention to the bone marrow. I've had it at other places where it's had a kind of mealy texture, but at the Hoof it was jelly-like, fatty, unctuous, rich, orgasmic.  My husband asked: \"What did that taste like?\"   I said: \"LIKE GOD'S SALIVA.\"  I'm not kidding. The most delicious thing on the planet. ON TOAST.  One tip: It's a tiny place, so you don't really want to go with a group larger than 4. Also, go early; twenty minutes before the place opened on a Saturday morning, there was already a line-up. Did I mention it was kinda snowing? There's practically nothing I will stand outside in the cold for, but I would totally do this again for the food at the Hoof Cafe."}
{"text":"Much of what is right in the world is on the chalkboard and on your plate at Hoof Cafe.    Fresh sausage, kraut mixed with meat and topped by benedict crushing beautiful egg orbs accompanied by delightfully perfectly crisp pork belly pastrami.    I'd recommend selling your domicile and moving in upstairs."}
{"text":"Really, this place is a 4.5 but the packed-in feel is a bit too much bustle for the ideal lazy Sunday brunch.  We sat at the counters which were great as you could converse with the bartenders and also admire the caesar making skills.  Went with the eggs benny with suckling pig and tongue-shaved grilled cheese. Both were top notch, with the nod going to the eggs benny as the suckling pig had a subtle fatty goodness and the side of peppery dressed arugula made for a perfect balance.  Love the hostess who despite the demands and bustle of patrons, kept it cool, organized and sat people appropriately all while pitching in at the bar and clearing tables. So unlike the mess at other places \"cough\" \"terr...cough....oni\". We came in around 11:45, left our number and headed to ezra pound for a lazy latte and the phone rang in about 25 minutes. Cool and efficient. I likey."}
{"text":"Why did no one ever think of french toast with foie gras before??!!! Melt in your mouth amazing! And the freaking donuts??!!! I  can't believe they didn't have them the last time I was there. This time they had them with rhubarb! Yes, bone marrow and rhubarb. So seasonal, the Hoof.  I just have to say, that plate of French toast is so decadent I am glad three of us split it. I would keel over if I ate that myself. (but I would. I so would. It's too good to leave a morsel on the plate. And I'd hate myself). I love you Hoof Cafe!"}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Brunch Specialty:Brunch, Charcuterie Menu items: Suckling Eggs Benny, Tongue Grilled Cheese Sandwich and Brioche French Toast  Ok, not your regular brunch place, I understand. But that it should become your regular brunch place, indeed it should. Or perhaps, not so much...Hoof Cafe is so popular now in the Foodies industry, that to get a table on a weekend requires both patience and good attitude.  I learned about this exquisite brunch place through the Foodies grapevine. Many of the people who know about my passion for food thought I would be pleased with the second version of the Black Hoof, turned brunch spot. They were right.   Hoof Cafe, located in the up and coming Foodies area of Ossington and Dundas; is a place where creativity, flavour, innovation and taste join to bring Torontonians a taste of what a true brunch restaurant should be all about. Charcuterie style dishes is what they are known for. From the same owner as the Black Hoof (right across the street), Hoof Cafe delights our morning senses with recipes and ingredients that just mix and match in one's palates like no other.  The menu, like the restaurant, is petite and contains a slick and short assortment of dishes that will for sure require further investigation with the waiter. The menu items rarely change, however they do swap from time to time a few of the dishes to introduce brand new ones.  My favourite of them all is the Suckling Eggs Benny. This is Hoof's Cafe version of your good old Eggs Benedict. Their version however, is what makes this dish special. The english muffin they use is rather tasty and not as bland as the ones you will find at a grocery store, I have yet to decipher the difference. In between the poached eggs lays the suckling pig. Each muffin is topped off with a very good amount of delicious, succulent and moist pieces of pig. The hollandaise sauce is buttery, yet not overpowering and quite fresh. You can tell they make their own sauce freshly everyday. For plating, the Suckling Eggs Benny are garnished with a piece of deep fried pig's skin and arugula leafs. Good Morning to me!  My second favourite of their menu is the Tongue Grilled Cheese. Tongue is considered a rather unique piece of \"muscle\" one eats from the cow. Known by many as something rare, Tongue is actually one of the most common served dishes in many countries across the globe. I like my tongue shredded, rather than served in its wholeness. This is why this grilled cheese sandwich is a hit for me. The sandwich is simple and has very few ingredients; however they all mix in very well making this an extravagant version of a regular grilled cheese sandwich. Pieces of tongue, cheese, dill and a tasty sauce is all this sandwich needs to be a hit.  Now on to my absolute favourite part and what I look forward to at the end of each visit to Hoof Cafe. Dessert. A delicious, exquisite and just perfect Brioche French Toast.   The bread used here was to my knowledge the same used in the grilled cheese. This bread is soaked in egg, honey, orange zest, butter and drizzled with thyme and peanuts. There might be a few more ingredients that I am missing, but by far the aforementioned hit my sweet spot every single time. Whether as an appie or as dessert, you can never go to Hoof and not order the Brioche French Toast. Oh, and if the toast in itself is not enough, Hoof Cafe also serves it with an addition of foie gras. Dare I say more?   Warning:  Hoof Cafe does not take reservations or credit cards. Expect to wait between 20-45 mins for a table on weekend brunch peak hours. Worth the wait though.   Buen Provecho, Viviana."}
{"text":"One of my favorite discoveries in my extremely limited knowledge of Toronto. It was totally worth the half-hour bike ride, even if we arrived sweating and puffing, and even if a garbage truck nearly backed over HG's bike.  It's been a while, but here are the things I remember:  Decor: light, airy, snug, cozy. It had an old-world feel to it, somehow, and I wanted to paint the morning light that etched the walls (even though I don't paint).  Drinks: one of the best Caesars I've ever had. Spicy, bold, tart and salty with lots of pickledy-things, and well-balanced. Somehow, I only ever crave these for brunch.  Philosophy: use the whole beast. I approve! There's a lot to be said for the efficiency of using everything you're given to work with, and so many tasty morsels that are missed by traditional wasteful New World cuisine styles.  Food. Oh. My. Gods. Started with little round strawberry doughnuts, freshly made using the rendered fat from the pig -- they arrived too hot to eat. You know how bacon makes everything better? Right. I don't typically like doughnuts. Almost a year later, I can still remember the way these tasted.  Pulled pork benedict: I'm a benedict fan, and this was hands-down the best benedict I've ever eaten. (Seriously, why hasn't this been thought of before?) Rich tender pulled pork, creamy flawless piquant Hollandaise, a fresh baby arugula salad (one of my favorite things), and crisp buttery English muffin. The whole thing together was decadent, rich but somehow not too heavy, and wildly flavorful. We ate every last morsel and wished we had room to eat it all over again.  I'm looking forward to coming back for other meals. (I'm salivating just thinking about it.)"}
{"text":"i want to live in their kitchen .  we arrived around 330 on a saturday afternoon . It was so packed and they were calling for kitchen last call . Although it was full to its capacity, we were quickly seated by the bar .  we ordered the suckling pig benny and brioche french toast w foie gras .  the benny couldve possibly been the best ive ever had . perfect balance of the taste, perfectly poached eggs and argula salad to cleanse your palette .. mmm perfect together ! and the french toast w foie gras ... ugh my mouth waters just thinking about it ! the perfect fluffy, moist but not soggy, toast topped off w the biggest piece of foie gras ive ever seen .. they both just melt in your mouth and the sweetness of the toast and the saltiness of the foie gras, combine together to make something heavenly going on in your mouth .   i just cannot wait to go back and want to try everything on their menu ! dont let their menu scare you, they do what they do very very well plus some more !"}
{"text":"Took a gal pal there for her birthday brunch a couple weeks ago, and it was very interesting - they use coffee beans from a place in Vancouver that roasts them (name escapes me right now, I really shouldn't write reviews in the middle of the night).  We had the charcuterie potpourri of animal innards (including HORSE!) in sausage sliced form which was delicious and interesting with the proper amount of pickled condiments and toasties.  (On a side note, I'd like to know who their bakery is for those toasties - they were perfectly crisped and tender at the same time).  We both ordered the eggs benny, even though I don't like a poached egg, (I had my egg scrambled) - it was divine.  The little side arugula w/lemon vinaigrette salad that accompanied it was a perfect palate cleanser.  And rather than order the dessert that did not excite me (it was a lemon meringue bar/tart type thing that day), we ordered another entree - the waffles with chocolate chips and bacon with caramelized bananas.  H-E-L-L-O - heaven on earth.  That was AMAZING.  I've got photos somewhere on my iPhone and will upload them STAT.  Portions are not large, but price point is good and thus, for 2 of us, we ordered 3 entrees and the charcuterie and by then, we had to be rolled out this tiny, quaint little cafe on Dundas."}
{"text":"Yes, it was delicious. Yes, it was different. Yes, it was all pork and swine, in a good way. I love meat so there is no denying that everything on the menu lives up to the degree of meatiness that I always enjoy in brunch.   I ordered the Suckling Pig Benny. For $13, I seriously expected the portion to be a little bigger. The side arugula salad was a tad bit salty. I'm quite positive that the \"croutons\" on my salad was at some point an intimate part of a pig and then seriously deep-fried and well-seasoned. I ate it, completely enjoyed it and didn't want to pursue any further in finding out exactly what it was. The suckling pig meat underneath my two tiny but perfectly poached eggs wasn't exactly mind-blowing though. The best part: the hollandaise sauce. It made the entire meal. It had a kick to it that I did not expect.   Also amazingly cool was the ceiling of this place. Metal ceiling with wicked detailing. However, the most heart-warming part: the waitress. I was completely taken aback in how thorough she was with explaining to every customer the exact ingredients on their plates and how each one was prepared . I must have missed the part when she was telling me what kind of croutons were on my salad. Oh well. I'll go back one day and ask her.  All in all, the food was worth four stars and I would have given four stars if the portions were more satisfyingly brunch-sized, considering that brunch is two meals in one for people who are not on a diet."}
{"text":"This place is very, very good.  Delicious \"benny\" with flaky pork and a conservative pour of light and lemony hollandaise.  Temp and texture of the poached eggs were as perfect as any I've ever had.  Crispy pork rinds on the side, nice touch.  Crunchy waffles with bitter cocoa nibs and a major slab o' bacon.  Donut bites were so-so -- jam filling could have been livelier.  Coffee also so-so -- consider another supplier?  The space is cute, as in small and pleasing to the eye.  I showed up waaaay early on a very frosty Sunday morning.  The line didn't start until about a half-hour before it opened, so if you can tear yourself away from the bed a little early and make it there by 9:30, there's a good chance you'll be first-in, first-served.  Protip: There are baseboard heaters along the wall under the window.  For my California-softened toes, this was a welcome discovery after aforementioned wait in the freezing cold.  Very respectable.  I will be back.  Toronto brunch has come a long, long way since I lived here about a decade ago.  Hip bruncheries on Dundas West?  Who'd'a thunk it?"}
{"text":"Due to the news that Hoof Cafe was closing down to become Black Hoof and Co., I just HAD to go before the 28th of February.  Possibly due to the news, everybody else decided to go this weekend.  It was about a 30 minute wait, so my friend and I decided to trot around Dundas West until we got called in.  We sat at the counter - which wasn't too bad.  I decided to go big or go home - I got myself the brioche french toast with the foie gras.  My friend got himself the suckling pig benny.   We also ordered ourselves the bone marrow beignets.  The brioche french toast was amazing - however, a tad sweet for my liking with the syrup.  The orange marmalade on the side worked great if you needed something not too sweet.  The foie gras was absolutely amazing and definitely went well with the sweet french toast.  I think if I had the french toast by itself, it would've been too sweet.  My friend ordered the eggs benny - I don't think I've ever tasted an eggs benedict THAT good before.  I thoroughly enjoyed it as well.  HIGHLIGHT of Hoof Cafe: the bone marrow beignets  I don't know what it was, but it was just deliciousness with raspberry jam in small portions.    It was to die for.  People: You MUST go before they change it into Black Hoof and Co. for brunch.  I don't think I've ever had anything so good in my life."}
{"text":"COCKTAIL REVIEW:  So this seemed to be kind of inevitable.   The good news: I like the drinks here a lot. The bad news:...for Toronto.  After 8pm or so, this place really seems to be hanging their hat on their cocktails. The gentlelady behind the bar is mixing up some yummy, yummy cocktails that are enough to keep a person happy for a while. The new Manhattan they are serving uses a vermouth that is not otherwise available in Ontario (read: shipped in from the states) that is a lot less sweet and more \"herbal\" than those served by other places. definite points for specially ordering the vermouth that they want.  Other fantastic drinks include a Havana which includes vanilla rum and lemon (???) juice. The bacon Manhattan is inspired in theory but probably best left to theory. The Sazerac was tasty but...dare I say?...a little weak.  So the obvious comparison for this place is Bar Chef. It is a tough comparison. This place is...well...warmer. More windows, more light, more casual...but there is something I can't shake.While the drink selection here is pretty good, it is not great (thank you LCBO) and, when I ordered a drink not on the menu, I was politely encouraged to order something on the menu.  Bar Chef has more of a full stock of liquor so if you want something, they can make it. Hoof cafe seems to be a more casual place to be but more constrained in their menu and a place to go if you know you like what they serve. I'm going to call it a toss-up in which Bar Chef's selection plays even with the warmth of Hoof Cafe. I would go to Bar Chef to experiment but come here for a date.  In addition, the Manhattan, while wonderfully tasty, is $16. This allows me to come in every once in a while but just that: every once in a while. I'll definitely be back but it has a little ways to go before it can approach some of the fantastic pre-prohibition joints of North America.  Note that this is purely cocktail review. The food here is cheap and tasty. As far as finger food goes, I recommend the ribs (dry rub!!!!) and, if you can get here on the right night, the BBQ oxtail (pig tail?)."}
{"text":"Wow! Where do I even begin to write about this place? This is really one of the finer places I've been to for brunch/lunch or a meal in general. The place is located a few miles outside of Toronto so traffic/parking is a non issue. Of course a great food place is always packed so we had to wait about an hour before we could be seated since the place is really small with maybe about 30-40 customer capacity. While we waited, we went to a nearby pastry/coffee shop to have coffee and some Portuguese pastries to settle our stomachs for the moment before the real meal comes.   Anyways, after the wait was over, we sat near the window seats since we had four people. If you bring a hot chick, it's probably a lot shorter wait because you can also sit at the counter/bar area. The overall feel and atmosphere was really homely and comfortable mixed with some 70's eclectic music genre. As we stand in the waiting area, we saw thru the kitchen thru a small square window witnessing the chef at work with his utensils and ingredients with the utmost care and effort. Behind the counter/bar, there were a series of cabinets filled with ingredients in Ikea jars and drink bottles of various kinds. In addition, there was no paper menu as the 15 or so menu items are written on a black chalk board.   Of course the food was to die for as we ordered a number of dishes including the Ploughman's which is a mixed dished of various Italian meats which I think should serve as an appetizers rather than a meal in itself. Next I ordered the Sucking Pig Benny which is tender pulled pork on eggs benedict which was just simply awesome. It was topped with creamy cheese and smooth egg yolk just spilling out with flavour. It was complimented perfectly with arugula green leaves to dull the salty taste. The Add A Bone is where it's really different with a half piece of juicy soft bone marrow eaten with bread.   My friends ordered the Brioche French Toast which was also very good as the toast was crunchy with a good amount of sweet Canadian maple syrup with a touch of cinnamon dripping onto to the plate topped with crunchy sliced apple stems. The dish also came with a creamy white sauce in case you want a little variety in your every bite.   The Tongue Grilled Cheese was also extremely tasty as the meat was cooked right with good texture and thick crunchy bread that makes every bite a mouthful. You can chow that down with either a cup of their freshly brewed coffee or freshly squeezed orange juice where you can truly tastes the difference.   Overall, the experience was truly worth the wait and the waitress was extremely friendly and attentive and prompt. On top of that, the number of \"easy on the eyes\" chicks that frequent this place while we were there was high so definitely worth visiting just for that. Remember it's cash only so don't forget to bring some change!"}
{"text":"Finally, I feel like I'm part of the pack. I have made it to the 'Jr. Meat Haus' aka The Hoof Cafe.  My friends and I arrived at 11am and were prepared to wait in line. Not surprisingly, the restaurant was full. But the meat deities must have been on our side because at the bar were three empty seats, obviously waiting for our hinds to park on.   Everything on the menu sounded appealing. Deciding on what to eat was difficult because you want to try everything, all at once.   We did start our meal with the Bone Marrow beignets. I was looking forward to these. The beignets are small and sugar-coated, with a fruit jelly inside. They were hot from the oven and were gobbled them up instantly.   The three of us had the same idea and ordered the Suckling Pig Benny. It's one of the café's most popular dish and frankly, one of the best bennies I've eaten. Along with our plates, we each ordered a side dish.   My friend and I had the Hay Ham ($4), while my other friend had the Pork Belly Pastrami ($4). The latter got the nod of approval from our server. The two strips of pork belly are fried and drizzled with maple syrup. The dish instantly earned the title of 'best piece of fat I have ever put in my mouth'.  If you haven't gone to the Hoof Café, I'd suggest that you do so. Don't let the line-up discourage you: plan ahead, get there early, be prepared to enjoy a great food experience that you will talk about for months to come. It fully deserves the 5 stars rating."}
{"text":"Amazing! I love the atmosphere, concept and of course the food. Staff were super friendly too. We got there early enough just after opening ON valentines day. Anticipated it to be busy and we would have to be waiting for a seat but we were in luck we got there JUST before the rush...people were actually waiting for our table. we had (brace yourself we ate quite a bit) the much anticipated french toast topped with a beautifully seared piece of fois gras, the eggs benny, tongue grilled cheese sandwich, and shared the special for the day .....wait for it...scrambled egg with truffle oil on brioche! mmmm all went down with a nice warm cup of joe! yes there was only the two of us. We had to make sure we tried as much as we could as we heard they are closing on the 28th of Feb. :( owner is re-branding the restaurant apparently. so this place doesn't get the FULL stars yet cos I didn't get to try the bone marrow doughnuts (only weekends). but I am going to try to make it down there again before it closes. it's a MUST try."}
{"text":"What a silly pretense for an expensive restaurant ! No waiting at all as a matter of fact pretty empty on a weekend night. Amatour staff. Unpleasant owner. Rather mediocre food which is way over priced."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome. Worthy of the hype and worth the wait. suckling benny is amazing. So are the pork belly strips. They are slightly smoky and served in a maple syrup reduction. It would be on the plate of my last meal.  Service is excellent. Staff are knowledgeable and very friendly.   Don't come here. I don't want to wait in line behind you."}
{"text":"I've visited Hoof Cafe and both times were drastically different.  1st time - We went on a cold Sunday night after dinner at Black Hoof for dessert and drinks. It was empty so we had plenty of room to stretch out and chill by the candlelight. Dessert was small but good - we ordered the cheese plate and a dessert that was a mixture of malteasers and ice cream.   2nd time - 12pm on a Sunday afternoon, hoping to get in for brunch. after an hour later, I was feeling slightly faint from hunger. After the hour wait, anything short of AMAZING would've caused me to say \"That was SO NOT worth it!\" Well, it wasn't quite THAT amazing, but it was pretty good. We had the donuts with jelly and bone marrow (though I can't say I could taste the bone marrow), pork belly pastrami (larger, softer bacon), and suckling pig eggs benny. Yummy & inventive \"hoof\" style twist to classic brunch favourites. I would recommend this restaurant, but I would also recommend coming on a weekday or before noon."}
{"text":"Not exactly sure what the hype is all about. My friends and I went on Sunday for a brunch..of course had to wait for about 40 min so we went to the cafe nearby. We finally got seats..bar seats right by the door.   The bone marrow beignets were different, tasty yes, very small, nothing to die for and I don't care to have them again. I had the suckling pig benny. It was good but very plain..not much taste to it. I've had better egg benedict at this other restaurant called Toast Restaurant on Queen East for cheaper! The portion was very small too for a $14 dish! I was still hungry after.  Service was good, the waitress was attentive and the grapefruit juice was 100%.  Would I go back? Naw, it's too far, too expensive for what I get which is neither the taste nor portion."}
{"text":"By golly, this place makes me want to turn Canadian - (not that there's anything wrong with it) \"eh\".  I would climb into their little kitchen and sleep there and eat off the floor if it means I get  all my food from this kitchen.  We went for a visit over the weekend and thanks to yelp I discover the place that would throw my whole diet off - if I was ever on one.    I never ever ever EVER order anything sweet for breakfast, mind you.  The sweet stuff (ie waffles, pancakes, and french toast) would come AFTER I have my breakfast while I'm sipping on my coffee but this place threw my eating system out of whack.  I had their brioche french toast with foie gras and I wanted to get down on my knees and thank the guy (or girl) who thought to force feed the duck or goose to create such a delicacy.  My very elegant french toast came with real maple syrup and you can see the fat of the foie gras blending nicely in with the syrup to create a slightly gamey sweet au jus.  The french press coffee was the PERFECT nectar to combine with this dish.  A large carafe easily can fill 4 mugs.  I also sample the Ploughman's (Charcuterie) plate filled with slab of salami , prosciutto & pate, an arugula salad and a side of bone (filled marrow roasted to perfection).  We wanted to order their brioche beignet but 2 things happened - they were out of it which is fine because we ran out of room to store them and I might have to start stuffing my cheeks which would be very unappealing indeed.  The Hoof Cafe is a MUST try if you're looking to brunch in Toronto."}
{"text":"Food is just as good as ever! Delicious suckling pig eggs benny. Beignets on weekends only, and they're delicious so order them! When I went they had a strawberry rhubarb pie with fresh whipped cream, wildflower honey and a (limp and dirty) basil leaf for garnish. That was delicious.  They had Caesars and summer sangria house-made by their \"mixologist\" with house-mixed rose. I tried the summer sangria and I was disappointed. No fruit flavours came out, and it kind of just tasted like cheap white wine. I wouldn't recommend it. They also were making Orange Crush cocktails with Campari in celebration of the Netherlands winning that day.  The food was just as good as the other times I've gone so this spot remains a 5."}
{"text":"The Hoof Cafe was the undisputed culinary highlight of my trip to Toronto this past week. I came with Susan C. and Vivek S. (thanks, guys!) for a brunch on a Friday afternoon and sat at the bar.  As Martin S. notes, it's a cool twist on classic brunch items. And seriously meat-tastically cool at that. Seamlessly integrating the often-divergent genres of charcuterie and unthreatening, comfort-ish brunch food, Hoof Cafe is some seriously good grub.  The wildest thing is that while you're eating pigtails, tongue, or pork bellies, nothing is jumping out at you being all \"look at me! you don't usually eat me! Aren't I novel!\" Nope. It's just chilling out, unpretentiously waiting for you to enjoy it. I can easily see Hoof Cafe turning charcuterie haters into serious addicts.  The pigtails and grits were phenomenal, with coarse, cheese grits served alongside of stew of flavorful pigtail bits topped with thin-sliced scallions and a sunny-side up egg. The tongue grilled cheese was equally awesome -- not knowing it was tongue, you might think it was just extra-delicious pastrami served with a bit of coarse mustard on buttery bread.  My personal favorite was probably the pork belly pastrami. It looked like bacon, but had that fantastic melt-in-your-mouth goodness that only pork bellies can really achieve.  I also had my first Caesar cocktail here, the Hoof Caesar, and will never malign Clamato juice again.  Amazing (yet accessible) food, friendly and conversational service at the bar, cool homey space. Looking for a foodie experience? Eat at Hoof Cafe. Looking for a damn good, rich and greasy brunch? Eat at Hoof Cafe. Hoof hoof hoof hoof"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite brunch joints in the city.  It is a small place with excellent food, so you can imagine how busy it can get on weekends.  The place opens at 10 AM but people are willing to wait outside early in the freezing cold just to get some of their deliciousness.  It seems they change up their menu, which is only visible on one chalk board in the place, from time to time.  Nonetheless, I have never had anything there that I didn't love.  Brunch is done similarly in this city, but The Hoof is refreshing in its uniqueness.  If you like trying weird stuff like bone marrow and tongue this is your place."}
{"text":"Although the Hoof is one of the best brunches in Toronto, after 4 visits now I believe I am in a position to now give a proper review in addition to a thorough recommendatory on what to order. Firstly, dont come here hungover expecting to eat right away, come here expecting to put your name on a list, then walk over to ezras pound for a coffee and a croissant, as you will be waiting at least 45 minutes for a table. Now, on to what to order: Eggs benny: its pretty awesome, but I found that instead of the pulled pork (which I find a bit too sweet for my liking, meshes much better with their back bacon), they will happily make the substitution for you if you request it, its heaven. Tongue grilled cheese, although its a really nice idea, as my friend noted, Tongue is a very lean meat, and therefore it lacks a bit of that \"umph\" you want from breakfast, It is nice but not reccomended. Bone marrow: hmm is this ever good, its basically all fat, looks kinda revolting, but wow is it ever tasty. Waffles, my friend ordered them, he wont stop talking about the. Charcuterie plate: pretty awesome, but then again I grew up eating deli meats so its good but not anything out of \"my\" ordinary. My suggestion: go with the benny and sub out the puled pork with the back bacon. Then, go home and pray you have a bowel movement.  enjoy"}
{"text":"Definitely an adventure in eating. Had brunch here with friends and between the 5 of us ordered almost everything on the menu. I don't normally eat stuff this rich, but man it was good. We all shared an order of the waffles, bananas and bacon. I'm not a fan of bananas, but the waffles had choc chips in them so I had a piece of that with thick cut bacon. The coffee is a bit strong for my taste, but I'm sure a lot of people love it. I had the tongue grilled cheese and it was pretty awesome. Thick buttery crispy bread filled with thinly sliced tongue and cheese. Not sure what kind of cheese, but it was melty and perfect with the slightly sweet meat. I also tasted my bf's French toast (minus the foie gras, which he ate all of) and friend's suckling pig Benny. Both were good, but a bite was enough because they were super rich. We also got a side of the baked beans which were quite possibly the best baked beans I've ever had. I had a small taste of the pigs head, but I'm not a fan of the gelatinous textures, so that's not really up my alley. Everyone else at the table thought it was amazing though. The place is super tiny but I really like the vibe. Glad I got to experience it and try a bunch of things I probably would have otherwise never eaten."}
{"text":"Dropped by The Hoof Cafe for a drink and a quick snack on Sunday evening.   The place was packed but just a short wait and we got to sit at one of the tables.   Personally I prefer sitting at the bar a lot more because I find the bartender a lot more attentive, charming and fun. then the lone waitress that has to take care of all the tables...  Duggan's Brewery #9 IPA 6.2% A.B.V. ($5) - nice strong ale malt with a hint of citrus and caramel.. - Bitter and sweet at the same time  Suckling Pork Belly ($12) - love the crispy salad on the side..Those are really addictive... I have to say they tasted like chips?! a little crunchy, a little crispy but definitely was vegetables - The Pork Belly is as tender and melt in the mouth as expected.. and went well with the reduction sauce on the side....  Bone Marrow ($8) - Fatty and Oily... and grossing my friend out.. :P - So ended up I ate the whole order...which is not much! :P  I think Hoof Cafe is better to come for Brunch or a drink .. and if you really want to have good food and services during dinner, it is much better off to just go the Black Hoof instead.  The cafe itself did get super noisy... and I thought Chinese dim sum restaurant is noisy :)"}
{"text":"It is actually more like  3.5/5.  I went to hoof for brunch just over the weekend.  The  place was a line up outside of the restaurant before it was open!  It was a very small place with around 10 small tables.  It is def not suitable for big group.    We have ordered a latte($3.75) and some bone marrow jam filled beignets $5 to start with.  And omg, the latte was amazing!!! This is def one of the best latte I have!  The latte was strong but not bitter or acidic at all.  And the beignets were quite interesting.  They were like a mini version of a timbit. Eventhough it was jam filled, I guess the bone marrow have it a hint of saltiness.  And the best  was they served it hot!  As for my main, i have order the suckling pig Benny $14.  It was pretty much eggs Benny with pull pork and a side of arugular.  This dish was okay, maybe because I am never a big fan of eggs benny, but the pull pork that was stacked under the eggs def made it more tasty.  Overall my experience was not bad with this place.  However I still prefer Saving Grace, a Indian fusion breakfast place (just a block over) over hoof."}
{"text":"I am writing this review late, but I ate there in 2010.  This was one of the best brunch places I have ever been too.  The dishes that I had that really stood out were the donuts with lardo (cured pork fat) and the braised pork belly with maple syrup.  Bbasically it was cut and cooked like really thick bacon then braised to softness with a nice sweetness.  These two dishes will standout for me for a long time to come."}
{"text":"Ladies and Gentlemen, one of the best brunch/lunch places is closing for good by the end of February.  What place am I talking about?  It's called Hoof Cafe.  It's a nice little cozy place that's been drawing in crowds since it opened its doors.  But let me repeat myself, it's closing once the month of February is over.  So PLEASE visit if you get the chance to.  Angela (my girlfriend) and I decide to drop by Hoof Cafe as we've been trying to find time to go together.  And I have to apologize to my readers and everyone for the little time away; works's been hectic and I've been doing a lot of OT.  The minute you enter the place, you can smell the aroma and you get the feeling that this is the place that good food lives.  It's a little place that can probably only seat about 25 people or so and it's definitely gets crowded quick.  With the news of this little place closing its door to expand, the wait has even surpassed the regular crowd.  The wait for us was about 45 mins and the waitress apologized for the wait.  She even said, with us closing people have been coming non-stop.  So let's get right down to it, once seated we ordered the Brioche French Toast with Foie Gras, Suckling Eggs Benny, and the Tongue Grilled Cheese the minute we were seated.    Once our food arrived, we tried out the french toast with foie gras and mannn was it good.  It was fluffy, moist and tasted great.  Now, Angela liked how the foie gras complimented the french toast.  I on the other hand believed that whether the foie gras was there or not, because the french toast was cooked soo well, you would have enjoyed it regardless.  A very good start!  We tried the eggs benny next and MANNN this was even better.  That's right, even better than french toast with foie gras... can this be?  Ohh but it was.  Just about everything about this dish was unbelievably good.  Not only was it cheaper, but to me it's probably one of the best if not the best I have had in the city period.  What a meal I'm starting to think.  Next was the tongue grilled cheese, now this was good but not nearly as good as the rest.  I wasn't sold on it as maybe for me I was expecting more cheese, but don't get me wrong.  It was good, but just when you compare it to the other two.... it just couldn't compete.  The winner on the table was definitely the Suckling Eggs Benny.  Both Angela and I hands down agree on that.    Overall, I really liked Hoof Cafe.  And I'm saddened to see it go as it's definitely a great place to stop by for a nice brunch or even that late weekend lunch.  And it's definitely has a nice little feel that you would want to bring a good friend or that special someone there.  The price isn't horrible at all so it won't kill your wallet unless everyone at the table ops for the Brioche French Toast with Foie Gras.  But you sometimes have to pay for quality and at Hoof Cafe, it's worth the price and the wait."}
{"text":"Being the chronic brunchers that we are, my partner and I felt it was time to check out the Hoof Cafe for breakfast this past Sunday. The boat-load of 4-5 star reviews on Yelp were pretty enticing so we made our way down to Dundas and Shaw to see what all the fuss was about.  ON my end, the food was porky and good. I ordered the Pig Tails and Home Made Grits, and my lady, the Suckling Pig Benny. Being raised in a Muslim household, my gf has never been a huge fan of pork, she just never acquired a taste for it. So when her Suckling Pig Benny arrived, one bite was all she could handle. Luckily for her, i am a devout carnivore, and obliged in eating BOTH of our pig laden meals, while she ordered the french toast instead, it was verrrry sweet, and she was satiated. I, after pigging out, was understandably stuffed.  I also tried the Hoof Cesar, and though 8 bucks for a shot of vodka + mix is bordering on ridiculous, the other home-made ingredients they used made it worth it (sort of)...  So the dishes at the hoof cafe were great for me and you'd be hard pressed to find any meat-eating meatitarian who would disagree. If you go, be prepared to eat pigs, in every shape, dish, and style. Know that, and you you will get what you pay for in spades."}
{"text":"Hoof Cafe provides a porky, head-to-tail take on the brunch meal.  Out of about 15 items written on the chalkboard, about 10 feature main ingredient coming from the pig and most of them are some sort of offal dish.  Now that's my kind of brunch place!    The tongue grilled cheese sandwich, with a pastrami-like construction, juicy with big flavor, was easily one of the best sandwiches I've ever had anywhere in terms of taste.  Suckling pig rib lollipop had pretty intense smoky flavor paired with a sweet dipping syrup.  The meat was quite clingy to the bone but tasty.  Superb take on the southern grits with pig tail, poached eggs adding even more richness to the dish, but I am not so sure about the boring presentation of the tail as a nondescript block.  I sampled pig's head turned into a slab of meat (like headcheese without aspic), and loved the fatty, savory, though not exciting-looking dish.  \"Belly pastrami\" was likewise great, crispy but also meaty and bacon-y.  I liked the richness of the foie gras paired with ripened strawberries, but it got just a little cloying with toasted brioche and syrup.  I sampled a companion's pulled pork benedict, it was very good but not something I'd choose over other dishes.  Overall, the selection and taste were topnotch.  This is the sort of brunch I would love to eat over most traditional places serving more formulaic brunch dishes.    I considered rating this place 4 stars because the space was tiny, crowded, and almost unbearably hot on my visit, with stale, sticky air.  But the food was good and heat waves not so common anyway, so I'll just make a remark about it and still give 5 stars."}
{"text":"YES, I managed to make it out here 3 days before it closed.  After all the crazy hype about it, this was near the very top of my try list. Danny W. and I ordered two plates to share: Tongue Grilled Cheese and the Scrapple.    Both of us really like tongue but had in the past only eaten it mainly in stews or soups.  Not having eaten tongue in a while, the taste is pretty distinct and we enjoyed the sandwich! I like that they cut it in fine thin slices to pile onto the sandwich.  The bread was really nicely toasted, crunchy. It was a good contrast to the juicy soft meat inside.  The scrapple was an interesting dish... can't quite remember what parts they mushed together to make this patty, but it was like jowl and cheek and something.  Honestly, it was ground into such a paste to make the patty that I may have believed you if you said it was a bean patty.  It came with a tiny salad and a sunny-side up, properly runny, just how I like it :)   I think I enjoyed the tongue sandwich more, as I didn't really care for the texture of the meat in the scrapple.  Overall though, cool place to chill with a friend, the place was B U S Y even at 3pm, every seat taken. Sad that it's closed, happy I made it before the ending.  Good luck to their future project."}
