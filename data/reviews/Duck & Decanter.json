{"text":"Excellent sandwiches.  Avocado on toasted sourdough was the best.  Must have had two whole avocados on the sandwich!"}
{"text":"Finally after live in AZ for 3 years I walked into a Duck and Decanter starved after a bikram yoga class. Long story short I got the Duckling Sandwich which literally only had a small amount of duck, horseradish, slightly melted cheese, and came on an onion bun. It was supposed to be a hot sandwich which means piping hot meat and melted cheese in my mind. I ordered the mini and this sad Sandwich was $6.95. The meat was tasty but they do not provide a lot of protein. I should have biked straight home from bikram yoga where I would have saved a total of $9.13 and filled myself up with my yummy home cooking. Never again will I go to this overpriced and over hyped spot."}
{"text":"This place....let's start off with customer service. IMPECCABLE. Dave is always friendly and courteous. The delivery workers are always prompt, polite, and friendly. The overall rating for customer service is a 10!!!!


The food? Wow. The sourdough bread is incredible, their meats and cheeses are REAL, and I'm anti GMO, big label company's so that's right up my alley. The bagels are GIGANTIC, toasted to perfection, and delicious. Their cookies??? Forget about it! The most delicious chocolate chip cookies I've had since I moved to Arizona. Fluffy, moist, sweet, and divine! 

I can't think of one single thing I don't like about this place, and I'll be a regular as long as I rest my head in Phoenix!!! Keep on doing great things, yum!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good but won't be going there again. My friend and I had our 3 little kids with us (two of them only a year old). The babies were a bit fussy but not being out of control, and the manager came to us and told us we needed to quiet down. I was very offended seeing that the babies are only 1 year old, obviously children that age are hard to tell to be quiet. I take my kids out to eat all the time and have never had this issue at a restaurant, not pleased with how we were treated."}
{"text":"\"The Duck\" as I like to call it never disappoints. This, as with all places downtown, gets pretty busy so I would recommend going earlier in the lunch hours. My two staple sandwiches are the fiery Italian (and it is) and a build my own with turkey and havarti. The fiery Italian is as it sounds, the usual Italian meats and cheese but it's their hot peppers that give it the extra something. Also, the quality of their products make it a much better sandwich than a lot of the other options in the area. The best part of the build my own is the champagne mustard. It's kind of like a honey mustard but possibly more delicious. If you are downtown and looking for a sandwich this is definitely the best option for quality and taste."}
{"text":"Their iced chai is really good - best one I've had.  Their classic Reuben sandwich is good.  They let you do a \"mini\" on the sandwich you want, which gives you a filling sandwich for under $5.  It's a nice location.  They take kind of long to get your order out when they get busy, but otherwise it's a good place and it's right by the light rail and other points of interest."}
{"text":"Quack!  Quack!  I have LOVED the Duck for many, many years.  I go there for a 'custom made' sandwich everytime I am in the neighborhood.

It is a very unique place and I have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Loved this place! My husband and I went there for lunch on his very first Father's Day and it was great! I had an avocado sandwich with bacon and pepper harvarti added, he had The Duckling. Both sandwiches were delicious--fresh, crisp, and flavorful. The seating area outside was lovely, and with the misters, even a mid day lunch in June was comfortable. We also shared the potato bacon soup, which was delicious and satisfying. We liked the shop inside and had fun looking at everything and smelling the different teas and coffees sold there. I also really liked how they were pet friendly with biscuits and water bowls outside. We cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It honestly hurts me to have to leave a one star review for this place, considering I know the family who started and owns the business rather well and they are very good people. I've been eating here since I was 12 years old, and when I grew older and lived in the neighborhood I ate there almost once a week, many times even daily. Clearly, I'm not even exaggerating a little when I say that I love this place and think the food is amazing. Lately, however I have been experiencing a lot of issues with my orders being made improperly and a lack of support from the staff in compensation for the issue.

I haven't eaten there for a long time, it might be my actual favorite place to eat and for the most part if I could eat anything at all this is what I would choose, so I recently decided to place an order. I got home with my food and realized that everything was made improperly. I called them before they closed to make sure they knew what happened and they gave me credits for free food.

After remembering how good their food is, despite the mistakes made to my order, I was left craving more and decided to try again so I could use the free credits they gave me. When I got home the food was made incorrectly again, but I live far and really didn't feel like driving back, so I picked everything off that wasn't supposed to be there and moved on with my day.

Soon after I took a friend of mine there because she had never been and despite these two past experiences I still considered it my favorite place to eat. We ordered, waited, got our food, and sat down. I opened my sandwich to find it made incorrectly, yet again. After becoming quite sad, my friend encouraged me to go back inside and tell them. They remade the sandwich for me and everything was fine.

Because of my recent issues, when I placed my latest order, I made sure to ask the person taking my order to have the person making the sandwich double-check the bag to insure my food was made exactly as I ordered it. He assured me that he would, and when I picked up my food he confirmed with me that he did indeed check. Unfortunately when I got home I found that my food was made wrong, surprise! AGAIN.

I reached my breaking point and called asking to speak with a manager. I gave her an in-depth explanation of the situation just as mentioned above and asked if it'd be possible to be refunded for today's food and was told that she'd need to look more seriously into the matter and call me back the next day to let me know what she'd be able to do for me. I'm still waiting to hear from her, hopefully I'll be able to change this review when I do."}
{"text":"This place has it all, great food, great service, and great people.  I would definitely come back here for \"A Nooner\" anytime!"}
{"text":"My longtime love affair with Duck and Decanter may finally be over! I went into the downtown location for a muffin. After waiting some time and being stared at by employees, one finally decided to help me. I picked out a medium-sized muffin and at the register was asked for over $4.00. I know prices go up, but that is ridiculous. I told the employee no thanks, and she actually said to me \"No skin off my nose!!\" What has happened to what was once a very classy place?"}
{"text":"I come here way too often (at least once a week) and have only ever gotten one thing - the curry chicken salad. It is seriously the best thing ever. It's a lot more than just a restaurant, I've picked up treats to bring home and also cooking supplies! It's a really cool place that I highly recommend checking out. They also have a great patio!"}
{"text":"Very good prices for food, and it's great! Wonderful service as well. I also love their selections of breads, meats, cheeses, etc, etc!

Some of the items in the store (not on the menu) are a bit overpriced. Also, when I have taken my sandwich home, it didn't last very long and wasn't nearly as good as it was in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Quality and speed at a good price point.   This place is the ultimate spot for a quick lunch in a hectic business schedule."}
{"text":"Duck and Decanter is a pretty cool place, especially for lunch.  The atmosphere has some type of a small-town feel to it, where the place not only has sandwiches, but sells spices and wine, among other stuff. I really felt comfortable and actually wanted to spend a little more time in there, but I was on a tight schedule.

I had a turkey sandwich.  The turkey was fantastic, and the ingredients were fresh.  I was really impressed with the wheat bread.  It really made the sandwich.

As I was waiting for my sandwich, I couldn't help but notice, the many different salads they had on display.  All of them looked good, so I decided to go with a little macaroni salad.  WOW, it was so good!  I bought a half-pint, thinking I'd save some for later, when instead, I just ate 
the whole thing.  Whoops!

I cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here while I was at work. I had the Vermont sandwich which was okay. My favorite part? The pickles."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite morning coffee place!  Lots of tables, free wifi, short lines, and great food too.  The Mexicana coffee here is my personal favorite.  Breakfast burritos are good too.  This location seems to have a lot of competition in the area (McDonalds, Starbucks, Einsteins, America's, etc)  but it is by far the best place to sit and relax."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and lots of choices for the iced tea enthusiast. My favorite sandwich is the tuna albacore on dark rye. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Why do people like this place?  Can't they buy a loaf of sliced bread, some deli meat and some dijon mustard at any grocery store and make a comparable sandwich?  I am a long time Phoenix resident, and I have always thought this place was BORING!  I have to meet people here once  in a while, and always make up the excuse that I have already eaten."}
{"text":"We went here for my sister's birthday, and we were able to reserve the smaller patio for the whole family to have a private lunch. It was very personal, and the staff was all very friendly. We all were able to bring our dogs (which was awesome), and the food was delicious. I'm glad I finally stopped in and gave it a try!"}
{"text":"After reading good reviews, we thought we'd try this place out. While waiting for our food, we needed to use the restroom, so we followed the sign outside. When we arrived at the outdoor restroom, we were informed by the manager that both were out of order. As we went back inside, our order was called up. We then asked the worker if there was a restroom nearby that we could use. He kindly volunteered the restroom in the back. Unfortunately, it was quite dirty. And, when one of the workers walked by they got upset with us for using the restroom that the other worker gave us permission to use.

After that, the food did not seem quite so appetizing. However, we payed for and picked up our order, but even though we ordered the sandwiches hot they were not. Additionally, do beware that their cheeses are incredibly sharp.

Unsanitary, disorganized, and poor customer service. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Sandwiches and breakfast (7am - 7pm) at this location. All can be eaten here or taken in a bag to go. These folks are excellent at packing up their \"nooner\" sandwich bags for everyone at your downtown Phoenix lunch meeting. And everyone can get whatever meat and condiments on whatever bread they choose (albacore tuna salad is the #1 seller). Breakfast is sandwich style as well. Several fresh iced tea options (including prickly pear fruit on one day I was there)."}
{"text":"I've been eating there for years, it is classic Phoenix! The sandwiches are artfully made to your exact specifications and I love how you can taste every ingredient in every bite. That is their standard of tasty quality! My fave is Where's the Beef with a portion of turkey, ask for shredded cheese! I also like the pastrami on dark rye with avocado, shredded cheese and coleslaw! My favorite place to sit is in the wine room unless the weather is nice, then outside is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Today was a whirlwind of a day. Before my husband and I set out on our groupon redeeming adventure all over Phoenix, we decided to stop in here for lunch. This is the first time I have been in here to eat since becoming vegetarian almost a year and a half ago, and before then we used to come in all of the time. At least once a month to get some sandwiches while we were out shopping in this part of town. Today I decided would be a good day to check this place back out, as I was craving sandwiches anyways. We must have come in at an off time because it wasn't very crowded. But then again, most people don't eat lunch at 3pm. There was a musician playing out on the patio for a few guests.

We walked in and my husband and I both decided on the Where's the beef? sandwich, which was lettuce, tomato, avocado, jicama, celery, sprouts, cucumber, swiss cheese, mayo and mustard. I got mine on an onion roll and my husband decided on whole wheat. We paroozed the store while we were waiting for our sandwiches and we also purchased a large bottle of water and chips. There is also a little section inside where you can purchase teas, coffees, jams, spices, oils, kitchen tools, among other items. I can't say that I have ever bought any of these items but some of them are pretty interesting. Today I saw boxed potatoes. I don't know why but I thought it was the strangest thing ever. 

Anyways. So our sandwiches are ready and we pay and we sat upstairs overlooking the rest of the store. I dig into my sandwich and I really love it. I'm a sandwich slut anyways so its easy to make me happy, but there were a ton of veggies. I didn't feel like I was gipped at all. Most sandwich places will give you the flattest sandwich possible. But this one was large and in charge. I got full half way through and still ate the whole thing because of how good it tasted. I think the value for a sandwich like this is just about the same as every other sandwich shop I have had that has a vegetarian option. It was $7, which is about average. So I don't feel like I was robbed or anything. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"After 14 years in the valley we finally made it to The Duck!  What a wonderful surprise!  Friendly staff, great  foods and an adorable shop plus a wine bar and patio for added bonus!  

Couldn't possibly look at everything they have to offer in the short wait for our food, but will definately make another trip here soon!  Many many many products from all over the world along with over 60 International cheeses to choose from!  Great choices in salads and sandwiches along with anything you want to drink or take it with you!  This place is exceptional and can be very overwhelming on your first visit, but you can easily change around anything you want from the bread to the condiments and add any kind of cheese you could possibly think of!  

Yes it is a little odd to get to the first time and yes there is a parking lot next to this place, but it has been there for over 35 years - so I'm betting GNC, Sports Authority or Einsteins (ugh - the worst!) was even a thought when this place was built, besides after you enter their lovely patio you completely forget about all of that!  It's better than I ever imagined and we are both ready to go back and try more!

We can't believe it's taken us this long to visit this place and now we are sorry we waited, what a great find!  If you live in the valley you owe it to yourself to try The Duck!  As for the people who say expensive - I don't know where they are eating but this is very reasonable, especially for this quality of food!

Cheese lovers delight!!!"}
{"text":"Want to eat at a place that treats you like family? Here it is.

Want an amazing sandwich with ingredients meticulously hand picked from across the world? You got it.

Want real quality? Boom.

This place is awesome, you can grab a quick bite to eat or stay all day. From lunch sandwiches to catered events to cheese and wine parties. This place can keep you covered.

After you order, browse the amazing selection of treats and gifts and you will find so many cool little ideas. 

This place is top of my list and the best thing is its a local family. Way better than the big chain sandwich shops."}
{"text":"Working downtown over the summer, this was the best lunch resource in a mediocre bunch. Duck and Decanter was always busy during the lunch rush, and they do make a good sandwich, but they are way over priced. I come from hoagie country in Philly, so I know my sandwiches. I don't mind paying if the quality is there, but some things that D&D did really rubbed me the wrong way. 

For example, the add on fees. A turkey sandwich is already 6.25 (not that big of a sandwich). They charge 25 cents to add onions... onions! 35 cents for horseradish, 35 cents for hot mustard, 25 cents for sprouts, 25 cents for butter, 25 cents for cucumber slices,  and while I understand the charge... they charge 3.50 to add bacon!!!... I got this added to a sandwich one time just out of curiosity. Maybe it would be the best sandwich ever, I mean $3.50 bacon could be immaculate. Maybe I set the bar too high, but their bacon was terrible. 

A 6.25 dollar sandwich could easily turn in to an 10-11 dollar sandwich. Anywhere else in the valley, this same sandwich would be the same price (6.25) or cheaper.

After my summer job was completed, I never set foot in a Duck and Decanter again. It just felt like a clip joint that offered okay to good food."}
{"text":"Met up with an SPJ group for networking event. The outdoor ambience was relaxing and just set apart enough for our group. Mini deli sandwiches were prepared for us, and we all ordered drinks from the supremely affable bartender. There's probably 100 different types of beers/wines here...I didn't have time to browse all the gourmet groceries...it was an ideal marriage of tasty food and atmosphere this last day of April. I guess I'll go inside next time I'm here; it's about to get so hot! Edit: they tell me they have misters too, and not just the masculine variety. ;)"}
{"text":"The Duck and Decanter is THE place for a sandwich or a glass of wine. Great food and wine selections. I am not a beer drinker myself, but friends tell me that the beer selection is also stellar. Staff is always friendly. Can't wait for the summer to be over and to enjoy a leisurely afternoon on their patio again."}
{"text":"I am native to the Phoenix area and have been going to the Duck and Decanter since I was a small child, in fact my older sister used to work there. They have really great sandwiches that are high quality and very tasty and they come with great customer service. This is a good place to enjoy breakfast or lunch with a client, friends or go by yourself and enjoy the free Wi-Fi. Plus they have a great little meeting room that they let people use. I use it every Wednesday for my networking group. Wonderful place and an institution in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is great. It was my first time coming here and I didn't really know what to expect coming in after looking at their website and reading other yelp reviews. What stuck out most to me was how quiet and tranquil it was. It wasn't pretentious, or a hassle with them wanting you to buy anything, or otherwise stressful or anything like that. It's a genuine hide away that gave me flashbacks of having lunch on my front lawn in the house I grew up in in western Oregon. Lush grass, big and plenty deciduous trees to provide plenty of shade and make that cool sound when a breeze comes through. It is very simple and tranquil to dine at. It also reminds me a lot of A.J.'s minus the grocery store and just offering quality coffee, wine, beer, sandwiches and sweets/desserts in a pleasant and classy atmosphere.

I got their special. So for Wednesday it was the \"Healthy Humpday\" which is half of a generously portioned ham sandwich, as well as a generous helping of salad also with a dill pickle on the side and a taffy in a brown paper bag. Totaling a little over $4.50. Then I made my way over to the bar area and got a 12oz craft beer for their happy hour special of $3.00. So I basically got a generous quality lunch that left me stuffed and satisfied for $8.41 total. I was very impressed with everything and very much look forward to going back and eating there again."}
{"text":"Have enjoyed this spot for years but what has happened to Camelback store? Sandwiches and friendly staff still good as ever but during two-three visits over past year, once-inviting patio has degenerated into a dirty, neglected eyesore full of dead leaves from nearby trees, dusty unbussed tables and an inoperative misting system. A real turn-off, especially since you have to walk through patio to enter, even to pick up to-go orders."}
{"text":"Was a bummer to see that my hot food was microwaved in front of me.  Aside from that their cold sandwiches and wraps are tasty"}
{"text":"One of the best locally owned sandwich shops I've been to in phoenix. I've been coming here for years, and they have always had quality ingredients.

They're fairly quick to make their food, even with large orders during lunch hour. They will not hesitate to whip up a custom order as long as they have the ingredients for it.
They're equally zippy with their catering, and the food looks just as good as in the pictures!

I order through their website so I don't even have to pick up the phone. I sort of wish they didn't change their soups daily, but I do admit that I enjoy the variety (same for their teas). They always have chili on hand, however, which is one of the best I've had.

For what you pay for, you get a sizable sandwich, and if you order a drink, they are generous with the refills. It's difficult to order from here and not be both full and happy!"}
{"text":"Best food ever? no.  Value for price? Through the roof.

This is an awesome lunch stop for those on a budget and they happen to stock a respectable beer selection to boot.  Mmmm, Hacker-Pschorr Hefeweizen on tap."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, got the hot pastrami with their in house sawerkraut. It was very good. A nice portion."}
{"text":"It has been many years since I had lunch at the Duck and Decanter on Camelback.  I hardly have any memories of previous experiences there, except that my impression was that it was overpriced.  Today, I was able to confirm that opinion.  Although a rather cool Biltmore area kind of vibe, it was awkward and a bit uncomfortable inside.  There is no flow.  The dry goods were exceptionally overpriced ($5.39 for a box of Carr's crackers?!).  I decided to order a little lunch and explore.  There is no love lost between customers and employees here.  I ordered a sandwich and the order taker assumed I was done.  I then asked for a side and he offered if I would like a drink.  He provided me with a large styrofoam cup.  If I hadn't already explored the interior before ordering, I would have had to ask at that point where to fill my cup.  But, I had seen the dispensers in the back corner.  I went to see what I'd like to drink.  I decided on a variety of fresh tea.  It was empty.  The woman behind this counter was quite snarky with me.  She withdrew the empty dispenser, exposing another identical dispenser behind it.  Then she got snarky.  I pulled the full dispenser toward me so I could use it.  Apparently, she was unable to provide the effort to move it herself.  After a very few minutes my name was called and I collected my order.  I was delighted to be offered a complimentary pickle spear (I love pickles) or a taffy.  There was no trouble finding an empty table outside.  I opened the bag and spread my meal.  The sandwich I had ordered on light rye was served on french roll.  The meat was meager in portion.  The swiss cheese was apparently not a slice, but rather a few sprinkles of shredded white matter.  This was not an eight dollar sandwich.  Since the menu had suggested the french roll, I decided to just eat it.  It was tasty, but not great.  I don't know what was the sweet ingredient included, but it was a little weird.  The southwest pasta salad side was ok, but a little too wet.  Overall, the $12.49 total bill was about five dollars more than the meal was worth.  I probably won't go back anytime soon.  We have too many great options today, in central Phoenix."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good breakfast before my workout.  I was going to go this place called potbelly but I just kept thinking you are what you eat. So I came here and got a 3 egg and chess sandwich and adding the spicy pickled vegie mix. It was perfect size for one person and super affordable. Here I defiantly didn't feel like I was getting ripped off or going to be sick after I ate.  Plus the guy at the counter was super nice. That always helps."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwich places since the early 80s...it's my NOONER stop any time I am downtown Phoenix, or at the Town and Country area...bread so fresh and such tasty sandwiches for all tastes."}
{"text":"This used to be one of the best places in Phoenix, but, sadly , they are loving the local vibe. The main areas is packed with overpriced sauces and such than no one buys . The wine bar used to be a great place to meet friends on a Friday night, but since losing their awesome bartender, it just isn't the same .  Bad service, mediocre cheese trays .
I hope they can save this spot. It used to be terrific."}
{"text":"I LOVE the Duck and Decanter!  I have been coming here since I was a little girl, and it has since become a ritual hangout spot for one of my friends and I.  My dad played music there (and still does regularly!), and I have so many awesome memories that are related back to this little gem of a restaurant.  The staff is always so incredibly friendly, and I love walking around looking at all of the awesome kitchen gadgets and the like while I am waiting for my sandwich.  This is a great place for families, and is also a great place for a low-key Girls' Night Out filled with music and great wine.  This place is so lovely -- one of my most favorite places to lunch in the Valley."}
{"text":"\"The Duck\" has been a regular haunt for me as long as I can remember. Even as a child I loved going to the Duck & Decanter. The sandwiches are absolutely delish as well as original. If you're not feeling adventurous though, you can always creat your own favorite. The cheese selection is decent and the cheese plates are always generous. In the wine room, you will find an excellent selection wines and beers, and an always helpful and knowledgeable staff member should you, like myself, need help making a choice. The patio is a wonderful place to spend an afternoon, especially when there is live music and fabulous weather. (Plus dogs are welcome on the patio.) Family owned and operated, the Duck is a valley favorite as well as my favorite!"}
{"text":"Lunch from the Duck is something to look forward to. They call their sandwiches Nooners ... how could you not love that?!

It's a step above your typical deli, so be prepared to pay $10 for a sandwich. Yes, a sandwich. Everything is made fresh to order. I usually go for the albacore, which includes celery and water chestnuts, and I add Havarti and pickles. Yummm. They're a reliable source for Selma's chocolate topped rice crispie treats, too.

Call ahead to find out what the daily soup special are, and if they have chicken and dumplings GET IT.  You also can order online - whether you just want something for yourself, or you need a platter of sandwiches and some fresh baked cookies for a meeting. Ordering ahead will save you a little bit of time, which helps since the visitor parking is limited (you can use the garage and I think they validate). 

All three stores are family owned and operated. You get a great lunch AND you get to support a local business. It's a win-win."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in Phoenix. I love the building, the wine selection, the coffee, the live music and the ambience."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick lunch if you're downtown.  They offer mainly sandwiches,  chips,  soups, Chilli, salads, cookies and coffee/tea/soda. For lunch they pack it to go in a lunch sack. If you park in the parking garage of the building they are in they will validate for 2 hours!"}
{"text":"I drive by the sign for this place almost everyday and have been wanting to see how it is. It's kind of hard to find since it's located near office buildings. We went for lunch and they were setting up for a live band (we didn't stay long enough to see them play but they sounded good when they were testing). 

I ordered the Duckling since it was one of their signature sandwiches and it sounded good. I was looking forward to the smoked duck, but I was disappointed. The cranberry sauce completely overpowered the meat so that's all I could taste. I don't mind cranberries, but it felt more like I was eating a jelly sandwich because it was too sweet. I could only finish half my sandwich and tossed the rest. I loved the outdoor patio and the fact that they're dog friendly, but the food didn't cut it for me."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. I had the duck sandwich with turkey. It was fantastic. I kind of wish there was more duck on the sandwich, and less turkey. An all-duck sandwich would have been ideal. The chocolate chip cookie was fantastic. The tea was also fantastic. I think it was raspberry mint green, or something like that."}
{"text":"Fresh soups, sandwiches salads & more, all made quickly with fresh quality ingredients.

All the sandwiches I have ordered here are consistently good.  The bread is always soft, the lettuce crisp, and the fillings tasty and ample.  I come here often and have yet to have a bad sandwich.

The potato salad is crisp and fresh, but not drowning in mayo or dressing.  To some people this could seem bland, however they do a good job at \"dancing the line\" between too much & too little.

A great place for a quick lunch or an impromptu meeting.  The offer dine-in, take-out & catering."}
{"text":"Tops any list of best sandwiches you would ever put together. Yet, they serve so much more! Best wine, beer, cheese boards, patios, live music, teas, coffee, and oh yeah... Gifts. You can drop in for a lunch and get back to work feeling like you have had an elegant break. Or spend half your day there while eating, drinking, visiting with friends and listening to great live music. (Music on the weekends and sometimes Friday evenings). This is my all time favorite place. I feel like I have spent nearly half my life here... When I lived out of town for a time and would either do a walk or just wanted to celebrate a good day with friends I sad that Duck wasn't right down the street. Check out the downtown location as well!"}
{"text":"If you build a good sandwich, they will come...If you build a good sandwich anyway you want it, more will come...

Fresh and creative, these sandwiches are fast and delicious.  The sandwiches are prepared fresh to order and the staff are eager and willing to make it anyway you want it with no complaints.

Did I mention free drink refills ALL DAY !!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that I would visit all the time if I lived nearby. The concept is solid (order what you want and it's written on your brown paper bag, and you pay when they call your name). I chose the spinach salad, which was great quality bacon, feta, and sundried tomatoes on a bed of spinach with a creamy mustard poppy dressing. People were so friendly here, that's what really made it worth it. There were plenty of tables available at noon on a weekday."}
{"text":"Today I forgot my lunch and Im pregnant, so as you can imagine i get hungery. I just moved into the building across the way from this Duck and Decanter location. I figured i would give it a try since it was close and baby to be was letting me know it was time to eat. I would go back in a heart beat, it was so yummy and baby seems to agree. If i would change anything, maybe not the french bread, a little diffiult to eat, but i guess it reminded me to chew my food."}
{"text":"Awesome food , great atmosphere, but since I've cut GMO out of my nutrition the only choice is two kinds of chips .so im hungry,"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, has a wine selection as well as some seating upstairs above the store.   My wife ordered the Sonoran wrap, it was on the spicy side, but really good. I initially ordered their duckling sandwich, but they had run out of the cranberry relish, so I went with the honey glazed ham sandwich. It was average or below average. Not much to it...just ham, mayonnaise, tomato, lettuce and cheese. The cheese and bread were quite good and everything else was average. The amount of ham/meat compared to the amount of every other ingredients was sub-par.  All in all, an average place to eat."}
{"text":"This place is a little pricey, but the sandwiches hit the spot.  I'm a fan of the \"Where's the Beef?,\" a vegetarian sandwich, aptly named because when you bite into it, you don't give a damn where the beef is because your mouth is full of avocado, tomato, pine nuts, and other tasty things.

Their ladies' room has one of those weird towel machines in it.  You know, where you roll out a clean section of towel to wipe your hands?  Not paper towels, real towel.  I've never seen one anywhere else.

The area near the kitchen is filled with all sorts of weird luxury kitchen stuff; spices and dishes and expensive decorations, and other crappy junk that no one needs.  I can't decide whether it annoys me or keeps me entertained while I'm waiting for my sandwich.

At any rate, you'll get a tasty sandwich and the upstairs area is a nice quiet place to talk with your friends during a meal.  If you're looking for a bargain, Cheese & Stuff on Central and Camelback is a better value for a great sandwich.  But The Duck has a heck of a lot more options."}
{"text":"Great tasting food, great service and has been around for years. Presence was a mystery to Me for awhile so maybe an Improvement could be better, more recognizable signage out front or up above. Other than that, it's a hidden gem here in downtown"}
{"text":"My mom introduced me to 'The Duck' when I was little because she used to go when she was in college, and it's a once a week visit for me.

I absolutely love it and I love it even more that once I had to become gluten free, I could still count on my favorite sandwich place to satisfy my tuna craving!

My boyfriend and I love to come on Fridays and enjoy a drink, a sandwich and the live music. 

I highly recommend Duck & Decanter to anyone."}
{"text":"I love the Duck!  I'm not sure what to say other than it is a staple in my rotation of lunch spots.  Their reuben is so delicious and I love the pickles they give with the meal."}
{"text":"I went in on a Wednesday afternoon and was stoked that they weren't too busy. First off I noticed what an awesome spot it is. It has a bunch of art on the walls and the sun comes in through the windows and makes the place light up real nice. Super cute spot for sure. Anyways, I placed my order and decided to check out all of the snacks and items that they sold in the shop while I waited for my food. I decided on the avocado pocket, because you can't go wrong with it at all and my BF decided on the fiery Italian. We both left happy campers. The pocket comes with coleslaw, pine nuts, cheese, and your choice of meat( I decided on avocado instead). The Fiery Italian comes with Smoked turkey breast, Genoa salami, provolone, tomatoes, Sicilian pepper relish, mayo, and spicy brown mustard on French bread. Both sandwiches were super filling and we decided to pair them with the freshly brewed iced tea that they have there. I'm really impressed with the selection they have. They had 4 different iced tea options and all of them were amazing. This place is definitely the best sandwich spot I've ever been too. They also have a nice little selection of craft beers. I will definitely be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I make it a point to come here every year that I'm in town. Honestly, I have yet to be disappointed. This was my first time coming since I have switched to a vegan diet. I was worried they wouldn't have anything for me, but after asking some questions I realized my options were quite large. Almost all of their breads are vegan, with the exception of the onion/ Kaiser roll(double check me on that) and they offer hummus as a spread if you want to opt out of the mayo. They also have oil and vinegar to spice up your sandwich if you want something different. You can customize your own sandwich and sub avocado as a meat, or simply go with one of my new favs which is called Where's the Beef. It is packed with avocado, Sprouts, lettuce, tomatoes, celery, cucumbers, and pine nuts. It's absolutely amazing!! If you're vegetarian, you can pretty much have any of the sandwiches and just get it without the meat. If you're vegan, you still have a ton of options it just requires you to be more creative. Honestly, all of the staff is more than willing to help you find your perfect sandwich. This place is awesome! Their beverage selection is amazing as well! They offer a nice selection of beer, wine, tea, soda, and coffee. You name it, they probably have it! There is plenty of seating if you plan on hanging with friends, and a nice section upstairs if you want to just study. There outdoor seating is just lovely on the perfect day. If sandwiches are your thing they offer cheese plates, salads, and delicious desserts!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch while in town for a conference after finding Duck & Decanter on Yelp. Check out the menu and then order at the counter - great selection of sandwiches and salads or you can create your own.

I opted with the Sonoran Chicken sandwich - tender, marinated chicken breast with a little kick mixed with jicama, corn and cilantro on sour dough. Huge sandwich for $8.79. They offer several flavors of iced tea and the raspberry, vanilla, mint green tea was refreshing.

My husband ordered the Whole Thing which was loaded with turkey, ham and salami and he wasn't disappointed!

Sandwiches are served in a brown paper lunch sack. 

Great place for a quick, fresh lunch."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! One Hell of a sandwich shop...... Not scared to pile the meat high.... And all the free pickle spears that you can eat....."}
{"text":"A deli and cheese shop, with a lot of similar random items for sale as La Grand Orange (minus the inane Doggy & Kitty name book).

It's a little pricy for just a sandwich with no complimentary sides (not even a pickle wedge) but it's got a low-key atmosphere and is not insanely crowded like LGO. Friendly service, too. 

Maybe next time around I'll just chill at their beer & wine bar for happy hour (4-7 pm)."}
{"text":"I'm in Phoenix on business and decided to hit a local place for lunch. Duck and Decanter is only a few blocks from my hotel, so I thought I'd give it a try. Good choice.

This place looks like a regular deli counter where you can buy meat, cheese, and other items, But they make sandwiches there as well -- and from what I can tell, good ones. I decided to stick with the restaurant's theme and get a Duckling sandwich with a glass of wine. The sandwich had smoked duck breast, smoked turkey, cream cheese, and cranberry walnut relish on walnut raisin bread. It kind of reminded me of a Bobbie (a.k.a. Thanksgiving on a bun) from Capriotti's in Las Vegas, except with duck instead of all turkey.

Service was a little disorganized. You order on one side, then stand on the other side and wait for your name to be called. It made sense to me, but for some reason people kept cutting in line in front of me to pay before they even got their order.

It looks like this place does a lot of carryout business, which is great -- especially if you don't have much time for lunch. But if you have a few minutes, I suggest sitting down, having a glass of wine, and reading through the menu. The Vermont Treat sounds great, as does the D.A.M. Lots of choices for not a lot of money."}
{"text":"This place is very confusing but has tasty sandwiches.

The good stuff:
-Sandwiches are quite creative and of high quality.
-The bartender in the wine area is attentive without being preachy.
-The shop probably has the perfect gift for nearly any occasion.

The bad stuff:
-I miss the turn for this place every time I go there requiring I flip a bitch on Camelback because it is buried.
-I can't figure out how to obtain a cheese tray they supposedly have.  The last tine I was there a counter person told me they start at $24 but didn't seem to know anything else about them.  I am not spending twenty some-odd dollars on cheese slices that may or may not come with the appropriate meats, crackers and dips.
-They close too early.  As a resident of CenPho, I am sick unto death of places that stay open through the mid afternoon only to close before 10PM.  I do not eat before dark in the summertime, nor do most of my friends.
-They do not deliver."}
{"text":"This is no ordinary deli. My mom and my grandfather & I used to have lunch here all the time when I was a little girl. I'm glad to see that it's still the same and just as good as I remember it to be. It has a certain homey feeling to it. The sandwiches are amazing! The smoked turkey is still my favorite.  The outside patio is the best place to enjoy your lunch when the weather is lovely.  This is a real Phoenix treasure. You need to try it. Enough said."}
{"text":"The Duck and Decanter is a family owned and operated business. Once you come it's like a home away from home every time you come back. They have a wonderful selection of deli sandwiches and will also make them to order. The beer and wine room is also a great attraction as well as the coffee bar. The meat and cheese counter is a great place to order a tray for the patio while listening to live music. I have to say that my favor go to is the Albacore tuna on multi grain and other favorite is smoked turkey on pita add avocado with all the other fixings. Review the menu prior to coming so you are prepared to order. We often phone in and pick up then head to a park or event.   Great sun teas and desserts to choose from as well!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love visiting D & D. This place is about the atmosphere as well as the food. On the weekdays the place is bustling with corporate America, moms meeting up and exchanging baby stories, a few networkers collaborating on a project and one or two snooty folks. It make up a wonderful array of folks having lunch. 

On the weekends there are families, dogs, children, babies, old folks, young folks sharing stories and sitting outside listening to the great performer chosen for that weekend. There are misters around the patio area.

I love the nooks and crannies where you can sit inside or outside. The sandwiches are good. I love the turkey on dark rye with avocado. They are generous on all fronts. Yes the place is pricey! Drinks, sandwiches and chips can run almost $30 for two people! However you get a free small concert on the weekends. The kids run loose, the dogs bark and it is fun! The wait staff is incredibly friendly and several folks have been working there for years. 

This is not a place for those individuals looking for a fancy dancy sandwich. This is a place to have fun, relax and enjoy some good food and a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I swear the same people have worked behind the counters for years. My friend works in the vicinity and we are always treated great when we go in. The sandwiches are fresh and yummy. If I had a little more time on my lunch hour I could easily spend half an hour perusing through their knick knacks for sale. I love the ceramics, tea pots, and even custom designed beta fish tanks. I am tempted to get one for my daughter. 

The cozy cubby holes are the best places to eat ! Downstairs, upstairs, outside downstairs, upstairs outside. Great options. Love the fresh brewed tea of the day. Snacks, sweets, and chips galore align the shelves too. I can't forget the grab a pickle and go area. Add fresh avocado to a sandwich and you will not be disappointed. Salads and soup are great too. Yummy.  Live music on the weekends."}
{"text":"Delicious cold sandwich hit the spot on a hot day! They have gluten free bread - next time I'll ask them to toast it a little just so it stays together better but it was delicious. The potato salad is different but good, it has bell peppers that I really enjoyed. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Sandwiches were alright, but not worth the price. Be prepared to also be judged by a snarky vegan employee for ordering meat on your sandwich. Also, don't go here if you have a dog. They claim to be dog- friendly but don't have outside service, which makes zero sense. Will not go back and I do not recommend it to any of my friends (or foes)."}
{"text":"The Duck is an amazing local restaurant run by an adorable family that is vegetarian friendly. They have a good variety of soup and endless possibilities with sandwiches. I really like the 'where's the beef?' On pita bread and add hummus. The selection of iced tea is great - jasmine green tea is particularly delicious. If you're downtown, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I love the duck! I used to work in this area and now I work downtown and I miss this duck! The egg salad sandwich is amazing. This location makes their own egg salad and they have the perfect recipe. The other locations are also good - just not homemade good! Todd is the manager and he remembers his regular customers and their orders. They have a large selection of side items- chips, salads, cookies, etc. 
They use the Belly rewards program which is nice. I have already earned a free cup!
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed this place since I was in high school!  I love their sandwiches...you get to make your own!  I always get ham, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, avocado and sprouts (sometimes) all on whole wheat!  Yum!  I also love a nice chai too!  They have a cool set up you can eat up or downstairs.  They have a giftshop which is cute.  I have not gone there for their wine bar, but I hear its good!  I would try it!  All the ingredients are fresh and the staff there are always so upbeat and friendly!  It is always busy so just be prepared for that...you can always order ahead!  

They also have a location downtown...its nice, but this one is better.  That one caters more to those that need something to go quickly!"}
{"text":"I love this little place.  It's so cute!  I love the option to have a mini sandwich.  I love that!  They're a little overpriced.  I like Bertha's Café's food a little better than Duck & Decanter.  I also like Bertha's price a lot better.  What I like about Duck & Decanter is the little store inside.  I've never purchased anything from the little Granny store but I like it.  My favorite sandwiches are the roast beef and the turkey sandwiches.  They are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I go back and forth about this place. On one hand, there are some really great things. I love building my own sandwich at Duck and Decanter because they have so many great things to spruce up your order. You can add so many extras to your sandwich to make it delicious. Russian mustard, plump juicy avocados, turkey salad with blue cheese, sharp cheddar spread? Yes, please! They also have great fresh brewed iced tea every day in a variety of unusual flavors. I'm an unsweetened iced tea junkie so I love this.

On the other hand it takes a really long time to get your food and sometimes it tastes so blah despite putting a crapload of extras and sauces on it. Then it costs like $10 because you had to add all the extras for flavor. Shouldn't flavor come free?

I think it should."}
{"text":"I love Duck & Decanter! I've been coming here for years! This is an awesome little spot to brings your friends for lunch! Not only do they have a great menu, but the environment and vibe is also awesome. This hidden gem reminds me of a log cabin that just happens to be a restaurant. They have a little gift shop in the restaurant and they always have the coolest kitchen gadgets and nic-nac gifts.  

My favorite sandwich is the Genoa. This masterpiece.... Genoa salami, herb and garlic cream cheese, marinated tomatoes, spinach on a French roll.

I've a had almost all the sandwiches.... Some other note worthy options are....

- \"the duckling\" - smoked turkey and duck breast with a cranberry relish,  watercress on a raisin bread. 
-\"briesciutto\" - sun dried tomato spread, prosciutto, Brie cheese, and your choice of bread. I also like to add spinach. 
-albacore tuna is also awesome! 

There are several more options that are fantastic but too many to name. Come check this place out and sit upstairs to see some local art or come on in when they have live music (Fridays I think). This is a great place to take out of towners."}
{"text":"I would say they have earned my business for life, but it doesn't feel like business when you're treated like a friend. The ambiance, charm and quirkiness of this place makes one feel right at home. Delicious deli items, an eclectic wine offering and top-notch service make this place my new favorite Valley staple. Great for events! Keep them in mind for your baby shower/bar mitzvah/engagement party etc."}
{"text":"Omg this place is so cute I love it so much. There place makes me feel like I'm out at California in the red woods or something eating amazing sandwiches. I had there ham egg and cheese sandwich was like the best ever I so am coming back I love it love it love it."}
{"text":"15 minutes to make an egg salad sandwich with only 4 orders ahead of me? When I open my bag, there is only half a sandwich? WTF? I go back and they acknowledge the mistake and proceed to make a half sandwich with and old piece of bread that was likely left over from lunch 5 hours prior.

There are too many places in this area to mess up that bad on a simple sandwich order to go back and try it again."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best veg sandwich in town. The people who work here are always super nice. They always have a variety of tea to choose from. It's a quirky and charming place and there's a market to purchase a variety of yummy items."}
{"text":"Plenty of shade and outdoor seating paired with a great sandwich makes for the ideal lunch destination. Friendly and family owned establishment that has earned its footprint here in the Valley. The food is fresh and tasty while the service does not fall short of excellent. What more could you ask for? Highly reccomended. Thank you Duck & Decanter!"}
{"text":"So I have been having the  albacore Tuna at this joint for about 6 years, Last night we went and we had it again, so we must like it, I think it is the mixture of the crunchy water chestnuts , julienned celery,\" just right amount\" of  mayo along with the mild spices  served with lettuce ,tomato, your choice of cheese and mustard,makes this sooo enjoyable, You choose your bread, we always get it on a french roll( crisp on outside , soft on inside)YOU know eat the healthy tuna on the not so healthy french bread, but it sure does taste great.
They have a great vegetarian pita, My friend raves about it every time,The menu is extensive about 20 sandwiches, salads and  usually 3-4 soups a day . 
On Fridays - Sunday they do have musical guest performing on the patio, I nice relaxing evening.
Can get a little pricey, but I nice place to  eat."}
{"text":"Stopped by to try it out after hearing about it from a friend. I tried the Trail Blazer on a wheat wrap with turkey. I was excited by the trail mix and it didn't disappoint. I usually hate cream cheese but I loved this wrap! Definitely would recommend the variety of teas they have i got the Pomegranate Mojito tea that they had ready and it s perfect for this hot day."}
{"text":"Great food & laid back atmosphere. The Fiery Italian(cold) & The D.A.M. Sandwich(hot) are delicious! Good selections of teas & sweet treats."}
{"text":"As another reviewer wrote this place definitely feels LGO in ways. But not exactly, it feels like a not-as-hip twin LGO grocery/wine store in Omaha, circa 1983.

Not that that's bad or anything.  There's always some nostalgic value for places that concentrate on food and comfortable homey environ so that they aren't so hip it hurts.

My first visit to Duck and Decanter was on a recent Thursday for lunch and was filled with the normal Camelback Corridor office drones and car salesmen. Delicious mix of people I tell you, but even more delicious was the maple glazed ham and muenster sandwich on whole wheat topped with avocado.  My lunch buddy opted for the tuna and it was pretty tasty but not the best I have ever had.  The pricing was average and with chips and a soda came out to about $10. Bonus points for the cheese selection feature bite-sized samples for a dollar or so. 

The wine store was small and charming and the layout of the place is so unconventional (with most seating upstairs) that it makes for some fascinating exploring once you get over the overwhelming collection of tacky bric a brac everywhere. 

I'm disappointed that it's kind of hidden, but that's probably best since I would be here all the time for a sammie and some wine come happy hour. Is it 4 pm yet?"}
{"text":"This place has been in business for 40 years!  They make great sandwiches, are great with take-out.  We love the albacore sandwich, but wish they cut the celery like they used to when they first opened -- lengthwise and very thin!  Have a great wine selection and cooking implements.
We love it!"}
{"text":"It's all about the patio....and the wine! I've also been coming here since I was a kid. I grew up here, and it was a treat to get to come down here for sandwiches.

Now that I am an adult (almost), I love coming here and just enjoying a leisurely meal on the patio. Of course, it is better when the weather is cooler. I can enjoy a nice lunch with my mom here after we have been out on one of our shopping excursions. 

I also came here a few months ago with a childhood friend who was in town with her 16 month old daughter. The patio was great because we could eat and talk, and her daughter was amused by everything going on there. She could walk around a little, and try to eat leaves off the ground, which kept her happy and amused while we caught up. Of course we didn't let her actually eat the leaves. ;)

I have never had a bad sandwich here, and they have a wine bar. What else could you ask for? Well, I do wish it was closer to home so I could go more often, but other than that, I love it!"}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich in the world. Been eating here since I was 2 and I will never get tired or sick of it. Duck and decanter holds a special place in my heart. There is nothing bad about this place :)."}
{"text":"Food is ok but can you spell S L O W?  During a busy lunch rush you would imagine that sandwiches could be made quickly. Waiting 15-20 minutes is ridiculous. And I beat the crowd!  Still waiting...finally got my sandwich and it was not what I ordered!  Plus $7 for a half sandwich??"}
{"text":"Best sandwich deli in all of Phoenix. A handful of signature sammies, but I prefer to build my own. Adorable space with knick knacks, culinary odds and ends, loose leaf teas, and mmmm cheese. They also have a wine shop for those gearing up for a romantic picnic at Papago Park. Quality ingredients, helpful staff, and decent prices. Why would anyone ever go to Subway or Quizno's when you could go to Duck and Decanter instead?? They also have dessert...mmmmm mmmm definitely one of the places I miss about living in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Duck and Decanter always has good quality but very overpriced for the amount of food you get. I always leave here hungry."}
{"text":"Been trying for 30 mins on and off to order a delivery. I get voice mail and nothing else."}
{"text":"I think I'll end up at the Duck & Decanter each time I come back to visit Phoenix.

I've tried the turkey sandwich and the pulled pork sandwich and both tasted fresh and great.  It might run you a couple of dollars more than a Subway sandwich but it's worth it.

Service is great, but as others have mentioned its not really a sit-down restaurant, you go up and order your sandwich, pick it up, and you can sit either outside or upstairs if you want to 'dine-in'."}
{"text":"Best sandwich in Phoenix, cozy bar, and attentive staff. We've loved this little family owned spot since the 80's. Do not miss out!!!"}
{"text":"I love the happy hour on Fridays with live music. Usually take friends here and always have a great time. Very well staffed, they are ALL well versed in their department. Great wines, beer and cheese plates. When autumn begins, we call it Duck & Decanter Weather."}
{"text":"10 Reasons why I love thee: 

1. Specifically, the Where's the Beef? Vegetarian sandwich. Fresh veggies like avocado, sprouts, lettuce, swiss and more. Good bread, not dry, not stale, just plain good bread. Plus full of flavor! And I'm not even a vegetarian.

2.   Alcohol with my sandwich, what a great thing to pair up and a huge variety at their wine bar

3. Side options, so many to choose from and not just the normal potato salad or pasta salad. They have those too, but sides like cottage cheese with herbs, southwestern salad, egg salad and more

4. Bread, meat, spreads and cheese selections too - I haven't tried all of them, but they all look delicious

5. The gift store... I'm always looking for a place to bring out of town visitors and this will be one of them. Its an airy building with cute items and some would be useful around the house too

6. All of the seating options, upstairs, downstairs, in the wine bar area, outside with live music, even midway on the stairs

7. Friendly service from the people taking our food order to the bartender taking our drinks

8. Live music in the courtyard area, such peaceful music that is not blaring loud. I can hear myself talk and enjoy the music too

9. That its next to Copenhagen Furniture. Yeah... most wouldn't care, but give me a break, I'm looking for furniture.

10. Half size options. I still take half of my meal home, but at least I'm not eating multiple meals of it.  

I haven't tried the coffee or their breakfast, but I'm sure its good too. I know this place has been around for a long time and I have no idea what it tasted like before, but I like what it is now. I love this place just the way it is."}
{"text":"The best made order sandwiches in town. My personal favorite is albacore on multigrain bread."}
{"text":"One year later and my 2nd sandwich was consumed with much success. I tried the Hot One minus the horseradish and it was great. Still not sure what the definition of Swedish Brisket is, but the meat was shredded, tender and was doused with some kind of straight edge sprinkled cheese. Try the french bread as it holds everything together perfectly."}
{"text":"Very expensive for a bowl of soup just over $7.00. Also the very small potato chips for the Kettle bag is $1.99. Really!!! That is way to high for 4oz of chips and mostly air."}
{"text":"Love the honey glazed ham pocket sandwich. It's a must try. They also have a great selection of teas to choose from. I personally love the cherry and blueberry."}
{"text":"I really don't even know where to start with this place.  I've lived in Central Phoenix for 8 years and have always heard about how great this place was.  That's the only reason I didn't turn around and walk out upon entering.  The decor in this place is cluttered, old, and feels dirty.  They sell most of their \"decorations\" and if you are looking for a basket from 1984 you will surely find one. The floors, the tables, the walls - everything just looks old and worn.  I don't find that particularly appetizing.  

So I figured, this place must make one hell of a sandwich to keep such a high reputation, and placed my order.  While very nice, the staff is s...l...o...w...  

I ordered the briesciutto.  I figured brie, prosciutto, sun dried tomatoes - can't mess that up, right?  Wrong.  The French bread was hard as a rock and was way too much bread.  The sun dried tomatoes were huge, but overpowered everything else.  I couldn't taste the brie or the prosciutto.     For what I paid and what I've heard, I had expected much better.  I was very disappointed in the entire experience.

My overall recommendation: just go across the parking lot to Einstein's."}
{"text":"Great weekend afternoon place to enjoy sandwich and a glass of wine on the patio.  Sandwiches are quality and always good.  Sevice is great!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. Not bad, but nothing special and nothing I couldn't make at home. That, by itself, is not the problem. Not everyplace I eat at has to \"wow\" me.

The problem here is the cost/value ratio.

$14.37 for a full size Reuben, thimble of coleslaw, pickle spear splint, bag of chips and iced tea is outrageous.

Every other eatery and cafe downtown seems to be doing fine providing larger portions at smaller prices."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 20+ years.  Love this place, the food never disappoints and we have made great memories here over the years. I actually worked here many years ago for a summer and found the stock rooms and prep rooms to be clean and well organized.  People that know me know I'm a big fan of this place, i thought it was finally time to review it on yelp.  

My favorites sandwiches are: The Hot One, Where's the Beef on a Pita, Where's the Beef add turkey, The Whole One on French bread, Turkey on a croissant and The Genoa!

Great family that runs this place, the selection and service is wonderful!"}
{"text":"One of the best Sunday afternoons I've had in a while....

My first judgement was wrong about this place. Being tucked away in newer buildings behind a starbucks, with kind of a goofy name for a lunch market, I was pretty sure this place was going to be a big disappointment.  WRONG (yay)

Though a confusing layout/way of doing things, the small but impressive market of cheeses, meats, pastas, beverages, teas, coffees, sauces and little do-dads is cute cozy and inviting.  The wine room is small but good and fairly well stocked with a good variety of wines, though a measly wine by the glass selection for a fairly impressive cellar.  

Workers were a little awkward at times but really helpful in making selections.  We opted for a sandwich and a cheese platter for two, accompanied by a bottle of Reisling.  The sandwich was really good and fresh, the sun dried tomatoes were awesome - though as a sandwich in whole i've had better.  The make your own cheese platter was AWESOME-you get to choose as many cheeses as you'd like, getting the chance to look through them and read descriptions and touch, great for someone like me who loves a good cheese but knows nilch about names and pairings.  It was fresh, BIG, and simple-A in my book. 

The owners son was friendly and knowledgeable, helping us select the right bottle of wine to go with our cheeses, a not easy task being I like sweeter whites while he likes dry crisp ones.  Though not the best wine i've had, we got a very good bottle for 15 bucks that was enjoyable. 

As far as seating goes they have multiple areas inside and out, we very much enjoyed the front outdoor patio with sun covers, live music, grass, and the dog and children friendly atmosphere. 

Only downsides I'd have to say would be the confusing layout with lack of direction, and the sometimes \"airy\" staff behind the counters.  But all in all though we had a great time and will definitely be going again soon."}
{"text":"One of my favorite veggie sandwiches ever!  The sandwich is called \"Where's the Beef?\" and any menu planner / company owner with a sense of humor is A-OK in my book!  Comes with tomatoes, celery, sprouts, lettuce, avocados, cucumbers, jicama, and pinenuts.  I recommend adding spicy mustard and havarti cheese.

Great place for a downtown lunch.  There are lots of places that do sadwiches.  I go to Jacquees for good Boar's Head meat, I go to Sticklers for the delicious fresh bread, and I go to D&D for the unique hot and signature sandwiches on their menu.  Soups change daily, as does a flavored tea, staff is hit or miss on friendliness.

Today I got to try the Buffalo Chicken Soup and was impressed! Then again, how can you go wrong with a creamy chicken soup with that tangy, spicy buffalo flavor? The good news: I could probably eat 3 bowls. The bad news: I could probably eat 3 bowls. Calorie counters - stay away from this soup!

D&D can get very busy around noon, along with many of the downtown places.  I suggest calling in your order if you don't want to wait -OR- you can even use their website to order online.  Cool!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch place! Very friendly employees and excellent service. Perfect choice if you're in a hurry or short on time but still want something healthy."}
{"text":"Stopped by this local café & shop for the first time last Sunday with my friend Monica O. and I think she has been holding out on me! This place is a fabulous, family owned one stop shop for good food and local goodies! The store is filled with everything local from wine, coffee, tea, spices, jellies, salsas and my favorite fun find of the day nut sacks...yes you read that correctly(see my pic) They come in a variety of sizes and flavors and who doesn't love a sense of humor... I am getting them for gifts, sure beats lumps of coal!
We shared a platter of cheese, fruit and meat served up with some honey mustard and bites of bruschetta bread, it was a great balance and flavor filled lunch. We chose some of our own items and had them throw in a few of their favorites. I loved the spice and flavor of the habanero cheese, the blueberry goat cheese with the prosciutto was a perfect combination and the Pichuberries from Columbia were a sweet surprise. The blueberry tea was so good and I don't even like tea! They had live music outside on a spacious patio and game tables upstairs.
I can't wait to come back for a Nooner....I hear they're amazing with so many combinations of sandwiches to try you could have one every day of the week! I mean who doesn't want a Hot One or a Banger for lunch!

This is the perfect place to stop, shop and eat local, I can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"Its a little hidden! Well maybe its really hidden, but once you find it, it is worth it. Its south of DXL, and it is very cute. Once inside you will see many things on sale like their delicious teas and cheeses. I got the Spicy Sandwich and it was very good. You can tell their ingredients are fresh. The service is also great, and they sell other grocery items that entertain you while you are waiting for your sandwich. The Sandwiches are very simple but are very tasty. They have many choices which makes it hard to choose, but you will like it enough to come back and try other items."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to sandwich places in the Biltmore area of Phoenix. Duck and Decanter has never steered me wrong. Plenty of food options and all customizable. Great selection of sandwiches and salads, coffees and teas, and miscellaneous merchandise. Ample seating both indoors and outdoors. Parking gets a little difficult during peak lunch time. Great quality and great service overall."}
{"text":"The ranch sucks, but the roasted chicken sandwich I had was super amaze. They also have Haribo candy there for sale... which means this place is even more amaze."}
{"text":"I really had no idea what I was getting myself into when I went to Duck and Decanter.  I'd seen the sign as I would drive south on the 51 and think \"I like duck, and I REALLY like wine. This place would be perfect for me!\"  As it turns out, I wasn't quite wrong, but it was not at all what I expected.

The Duck and Decanter is a strange blend of deli, gourmet food and kitchen wares store, as well as wine shop.  It all comes together in a fun and eclectic building set far back from the street and the rest of the shops in the area.  You definitely feel, as you enter the candlelit courtyard beneath an enormous old tree, that the world outside does get a little more muffled than it really should be.  Wandering bemusedly through the tiny shop behind the courtyard, I was really struck by how unique this place felt in Phoenix.  Care is obviously put into not only the choice of wares being sold here, but the quality of food presented to the customer.

When I finally got around to the deli counter, I was about to order their specialty duck sandwich when I saw they had a reuben.  As I find it hard to turn down a reuben anywhere, I asked the woman behind the counter what she advised.  Without hesitation she said, \"The reuben.\"  Just as I had hoped and I'm glad I listened.  The sandwich was excellent.  Perfectly proportioned and fresh as possible without going backwards in time.  Making a good sandwich really is an art and the workers here are masterful as their craft.

Sitting outside at night with a wonderful sandwich in this strangely out of place shop is an opportunity not to be missed.  But take care to go there when you have some time to really savor the place.  Like the wine, there's much to enjoy here and it'd be a shame to miss any of it."}
{"text":"They have a huge variety  of sandwiches.  Some very unusual.  Their meats and bread are very fresh . I like their french bread . Stay away from their fruit bowl but they do have good soups"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwich shop and deli with a nice selection of kitchen items and wines to browse while you wait. There are two floors of seating in addition to a bunch of outdoor seating options so finding a spot was never a problem. 
Daily sandwich specials for around 6$, regular sandwich prices around around 7-8 (still cheap) So far I've had the honey ham on sourdough and the mini genoa salami sandwhich. The sourdough bread here is super soft and wonderful with a nice chewy crust. Defintely recommend it!"}
{"text":"We  ordered  delivery,  the Sandwiches  we ordered  came early,  I had their  pastrami which  was plentiful  and tasty. I love everything their  French rolls. Their fruit cups are too small and not much flavor.  We also  had turkey  and avocado  which was also a hit,"}
{"text":"I love this place and I have loved it for over a decade. Great sandwiches, with so many options. An extensive wine and beer selection with happy hour! On top of all of this- love music on certain days! Beautiful patio seating tucked away from the bustle of camelback road. Part of the reason I'm so enamored with this place is the atmosphere, I literally feel like I'm hiding out away from the bustle of the city while being right in the middle of it. ALSO dog friendly patio complete with treats and a water bowl! And guess what else? It's also an eclectic store with a wide selection of coffee, tea and dry goods. Did I mention they also sell cheese? This family owned business has a place in my heart and if you haven't given it a try you should!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool a bit confusing for a first time. It's on the stadium side of the building when you walk to it, and it is a large building, and so you don't want to walk all around it if you can avoid it. The I stopped in twice and the sandwiches were really good. One time I got a kind of curry chicken, and another time some type of cranberry turkey sandwich. The people are really friendly, and actually remembered me on my second visit. It is locally owned and operated and you can definitely tell. I will be back when I am in town again."}
{"text":"We have been ordering from them for years. I had the fiery Italian  . I love their french roll. However this time I found  a piece of plastic in my sandwich and have not been able to contact the store"}
{"text":"This place is pretty legit!

Have been here 3 or 4 times and always have a good experience. I believe this is a family run place, at least it has that feel. The customer service is very good and the sandwiches are even better! I never knew a vegetarian sandwich could be appetizing but theirs definitely was. My father typically gets a roast beef that looks delish. I would recommend this place to any sandwich lover. 

Pros
-Good prices
-Little Tabasco
-Lots of options
-Made fresh
-Good potion

Cons
-Weird seating"}
{"text":"It must be me or I just never order the right thing, not sure. Everyone I know that has ever mentioned the Duck tells me they like it. Yes I have been several times over the years. But a few days ago I was at our office which is on 7th ave just south of Thomas. I was really hungry and wanted something to eat, this in it self is kind of unusual as I can more than likely wait until the end of the day before I have to eat. Plus the fact I have enough fat on me to last a few months I would not be starving to death any time soon if I missed a meal or three. So I asked Bruce, you remember Bruce he is the guy I am always asking things when down at the office. I wanted something delivered as I wanted to stay in the office to get a contract ready for signing. The only place he could think of was the Duck, but he said he could go and get it much faster. So I said ok and gave him my card and told him to get what he wants and order me I think it is called the Ducky or something like that.  Man he was back much more quickly than I had expected him to be, so they must have been on the ball in making the food. But the food as I always find; just nondescript. NO discernable flavour just a mish mash of textures and blandness. So I can say I like the building, the quickness they have gotten my food out and the patio. I guess the folks are also nice, but do not remember them so they were not not nice. I just do not get the praise this place gets, I find much better food for less elsewhere. But hey it might just be me since I am of the minority on this subject."}
{"text":"I'm a little late for National Sandwich Day but this literally IS my favorite sandwich place in the Valley! It has been around for YEARS and is truly a Phoenix gem. (I have been coming here since I was a little girl!) From their amazing bread to imported meats and cheeses, you will not be disappointed. I always build my own imported ham sandwich on their incredible French bread (...try their different mustards! I love the champagne mustard). Their iced tea is also a must. Whenever I come on weekends, 90% of the time there is live music on their gorgeous, tree covered patio in the afternoons! I can't wait for an excuse to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Really Fresh ingredients. I went with the Duckling which had a very unique but pleasantly great taste. I will absolutely go back."}
{"text":"Tasty made to order fresh sandwiches. gluten-free options. Sides, desserts, coffee, tea, drinks! Deli good."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! I always tell people about this place and the thing i tell people the most is that beyond the food, i really enjoy the people who work there. I have been working near by for the past year and every time i go in i am greeted by everyone! Everyone is so warm and welcoming! It keeps me coming back and taking my friends. Once they messed up an order and the next time i went in they had a free sandwich waiting for me! Everyone knows my name and i feel more than just a customer. On that note, there is one person in particular who has gone above and beyond for me. His name is Jason and many who have seen us interact think that we have been friends for a long time. The truth is that we met at the duck. Not only do i trust him as barista but now he is my confidant. When my day gets overwhelming from work, i go visit him and he does not hesitate me whip me up an herbal tea blend or a special coffee to always put a smile on my face. He is an escape from my daily routine, its almost as if i am visiting an old friend. I highly recommend this place, and i will continually return. Thank you to all the staff who strive for excellence."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today. Co-worker's and I ordered take-out for lunch. I had the Albacore Tuna on a croissant. It was pretty good. I have to say, I'll most likely be back to eat there in person and experience the place first hand. I will recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great sandwiches, normally pretty fast to get in and out of at lunch time. Service is excellent, super friendly and attentive cashiers. Wish I had some nice pictures to upload, maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Very delicious sandwich. Great Wine Collection and they have live music on the weekends. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I remember my Dad taking me to Duck and Decanter all the way back to grade school.  In fact my Dad has known Randy and his family all the way back to when Randy and my Dad were friends at NAU.  Their 16th Street location is as recognizable to me today as it was back then.  Today I get my fix sometimes at their original location, but also sometimes make the journey to their Downtown Phoenix location on 1st Street and Jefferson.  But for a true D&D experience, the original location is where its at (even if it might be a little hard to find).

Duck & Decanter is a sandwich place first and foremost, but beyond that its a tough place to define.  In a way I sort of liken it to La Grande Orange Grocery in that its a restaurant that also has a number of grocery items you can grab on the go.  There's deli meats, cheeses, wines, coffees, and even a respectable selection of local craft brews.  There's a number of other miscellaneous items available for sale too (not all of them food or drink).  Theres seating in both the lower and upper levels of the place as well as a nice patio outside that will often have live music.  The staff has always been friendly and the mood is always casual and relaxed.

They serve breakfast and lunch items, but a true experience here is all about the Nooner sandwiches.  You can customize your own or get one of their signatures.  The Duckling is one you have to try once.  Duck, turkey, cranberry walnut relish, cream cheese and greens on walnut bread.  To me its almost like Turducken in a sandwich.  For custom sandwiches, I recommend the smoked turkey or roast beef.  There's a plethora of breads to choose from (I'm a sourdough guy) as well as a bunch of toppings to choose from.  Be sure to study the menu before ordering as the sandwich combinations are endless.  They also have some hot sandwiches to choose from if you wanna go that route.  Oh, and they always throw in the pickle and taffy are free.

So if you're around 16th Street and Camelback and looking for a freshly made sandwich or just a casual hangout spot, drive into the Sports Authority shopping complex until you reach the southeast corner of the complex and you see Duck & Decanter's original location.  Beware this place does get busy during the work week, but you can order ahead for pickup.  Its great to see this valley gem thrive and still stay true to its roots as long as it has.  Hopefully Randy's family will continue the business long enough for me to take my own kids here one day."}
{"text":"$10 sandwiches without higher end meat and nothing to go with it.
Their homemade cheese they rave about taste like that wine ball cheese you get it Christmas time. 
Three mediocre sandwiches, three drinks chips and potato salad $40. 
Not worth it"}
{"text":"I was between a 3-4 stars.  I came here once before and wasn't impressed -- I thought it was a lot of money for nothing special.  But, today that changed.  I had the brie/prosciutto sandwich and I the fiesta salad. Both were great and I thought a great price for what you got.  The sandwich was very big. The salad was huge with a huge scoop of chili and a lot of avocado.  Very, very good."}
{"text":"This sandwich is a slice of home. It's a wonderful oasis in Phoenix offering delicious, one of kind sandwich's with a delightful craft bar and wine cellar. On a cool day bring your dog, enjoy music on the patio as you nosh and share a drink. Highly recommend the roast beef on marble rye or any of their pocket pitas."}
{"text":"I've only had lunch here but now that Pugize's is closed this is the only place I order a sandwich! It's veggies seem more fresh and crisp and as always the meats are great! I love their selection of tea. In the winter I love to sit outside. They have a very nice patio. This is just a nice place to have lunch!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today. Order the Genoa with no tomatoes. Apparently they thought that meant I wanted nothing on the sandwich but meat and cheese. Very disappointed and will not be back."}
{"text":"I have been going to Duck and Decanter for 18 years.  My mom even went there as a little girl when it was part of a plant nursery.  It is still amazing!  They will make sandwiches however you want them, and the ingredients are always super fresh.  They have lots of cozy, private places to sit inside and outside.  For me, it is an Arizona landmark.  I drive here 45 minutes each way about once a month just to enjoy the good eats and atmosphere with my friends."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a little kid.  I have always loved Duck and Decanter... can't believe it has taken me this long to write a review.    I usually always get the same thing... albacore tuna on ciabatta bread with avocado and sharp cheddar.  It is the best!  This time I decided to try something new... I got one of their specialty sandwiches called the Genoa.  It had Genoa salami, spinach and marinated tomatoes with herbed cream cheese on french bread.  This was amazing!  I will definitely have to make a habit of trying something new all the time.  I will always be a customer of Duck and Decanter."}
{"text":"I always enjoy days when I work downtown with clients because there are so many choices for Lunch. I love the Duck & Decanter on Camelback so decided to give the downtown location a try. Before I reached the door entrance, I could smell the baked goodness coming from within. Staff was friendly and efficient. My Chicken sandwich was yummy and coffee was delish. Gotta love & support worthy local businesses!"}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me will tell you that this is my favorite place on earth. I know that it sounds like an exaggeration. It is not. EVERYTHING is phenomenal here. 

\"The Duck\" is my measuring stick for every other sandwich shop and deli. 

Your first time here may be a little confusing, because your order will be taken on a paper bag and there are a lot of options. You should feel safe in the knowledge that no matter what you get you will be happy. 

My favorites are:

Traditional sandwich.... Roast Beef or Smoked Turkey on any of the breads, with mayo, lettuce, tomato, swiss cheese, add sprouts. 

Feeling like tuna? Alabcore tuna on toasted ciabatta, with no celery, add sprouts, with lettuce, tomato, and swiss cheese. The Albacore as a salad is a great option if you are not eating breads at the time (which would be tragic because all of their bread is fresh and perfect).

Uncommon... Italian Dry Salami on sourdough with mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, and swiss cheese. Just do it. 

Get the tea of the day. Browse the wine and beer room, consider getting a coffee drink at some juncture, and peruse all of the knick knacks and food stuffs. They'll call your name when it is ready.

I have had just about everything on the menu. No, I HAVE had everything on the menu. 

I am partial to the swiss cheese because I have not been able to find cheese like that anywhere else, but if you like cheddar (some of  you do) then try the Longhorn- it is the same price as the swiss, any other cheese will cost you extra. If you like cheese in general, then do yourself a favor and get a cheese tray, call some friends, get some wine, and relax. Get a sandwich to share with your pals, you don't want to make them jealous."}
{"text":"I honestly dont understand the appeal to this place. Its an overpriced convenience store that makes food. 

The sandwiches are decent...nothing to write home about yet nothing to bash about them either...they are just plain \"ok\". This wouldn't be a bad thing if I wanted to stop in and grab a quick bite to eat, but the prices here are beyond stupid for a mediocre sandwich. 

If you are getting a Sandwich and a drink you are in the double digits. 

Please do yourself a favor and go eat at Jimmy John's which is 100 times better. This place is subway quality for way more money. 

I think their deserts aren't bad which is a positive....but the deserts are also expensive. 

Comeon...get over yourself D&D."}
{"text":"This is my favorite deli in Phoenix. Two words: Vermont Treat. (Made with Maple Glazed Ham, Pinenuts, Spinach, Sliced Apples, Duck and Decanter's Famous Cheddar Cheese Spread on Multigrain.)

I like this place because I always know what I want (see above), and anyone I bring with me can always find something that fits their tastes, too. For the indecisive bunch, Duck & Decanter offers a list of signature sandwiches with the ingredients already listed. And for the pickier, er, more decided folks, D&D can make custom sandwiches, too -- you can choose your bread, meat, and toppings.

The ready-made pastas and other sides here are delicious, too, but I rarely get them, because their sandwiches are already so filling!

**Helpful Hint: You must, must, must either beat the lunch crowd or postpone your visit until after the lunch hour, otherwise you'll be at the end of a very long line.**"}
{"text":"Always a great time here. Band today sounds great, everyone is in the holiday spirit and couldn't ask for a better time. In my opinion they have one of the best reuben's in town."}
{"text":"I forgot how much I love Duck & Decanter until I visited today with a coworker!  I enjoyed a mini Sonoran chicken sandwich in a wheat wrap and an orange vanilla Italian cream soda - so very tasty!  I can't wait to come back and pick-up some items for a picnic with my hubby and the pup! Hidden location in the Biltmore area, super friendly staff, amazing little market and great outdoor space to truly escape and enjoy your lunch."}
{"text":"I love this place!

Whenever I go I get a Roast Beef on a Kaiser - great sandwich! And the flavored tea, try the flavored tea.

Fun, friendly atmoshpere. People of all types in here!"}
{"text":"Good place to grab breakfast that doesn't cost a fortune."}
{"text":"Convenient to Convention Center, bagged lunch/counter service, if you're dining in head to somewhere else, maybe Chloe's nearby for good service and more flavor.  $14 for small tomato soup and large tuna salad from counter service is excessive, downtown pricing I suppose.  Couldn't even get hot sauce for my soup without paying extra (you can buy one of those tiny Tabasco bottles for $.69), the tuna salad caesar from Chloe's had a lot more flavor.
They do have free wireless and a decent amount of seating."}
{"text":"I have never been here before so I didn't know what to expect.  Every time I heard the name \"Duck & Decanter\"  I would picture a nice sit-down joint with waiters and pictures of hunting stuff on hunter green walls.  This is certainly not the case I realized upon entering.  It is just a sandwich place that also sells a bunch of random bric-a-brac.  It is all basically picnic stuff I think.  I dunno...it was real difficult to get a feel for the place.  It was all pretty random to me.  But anyway, about the food....

I ordered \"The Duckling\" sandwich was is one of their \"signature sandwiches\".  It seemed like a good selection because the name of the sandwich and the sandwich itself had duck in it and so does the name of the restaurant.  However, the sandwich was just ok.  Nothing special.  Not worth 9 bucks.  just a few slices of meat in between 2 pieces of bread.

All the sandwiches on the menu did however look interesting.  They are definitely not your typical \"sandwich place\" type sandwiches.  Well some of them are but they all have that special Duck & Decanter twist.  The have some deli type sandwich selections as well but I would prefer to just go to a deli for those.

My wife ordered the chicken salad and it was very very good.  I would order it if I ever visit the place again.  She ordered the Sonoran with spicy oil & vinegar.  It was very tasty and no mayo or any of the bad stuff.

The service was very friendly but I took a long while to get our sandwiches.  There must have been a large order ahead of us or something because there weren't many people in the place.  I couldn't imagine going here on a weekday during the  lunch rush because the line would likely be out the door and would take forever to get your food.  Luckily for me I went on a hot Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"We stopped in last Friday to enjoy a little happy hour and were pleasantly surprised!  First off, the staff makes the entire experience - what a great group of people, especially the manager.  We enjoyed a little bit of everything: draft beer, a bottled cider from the to go case, sliced salami, two different kinds of cheese and the bleu turkey salad - so amazing!  This was such a nice way to wind down the week and enjoy a few tastes of different things."}
{"text":"It's sort of sad to live in Arizona your whole life and then out of nowhere get asked to meet someone at \"duck and decanter\" and... Not knowing what they're talking about. I'm pretty sure my friends almost disowned me when they found out I was a \"duck and decanter VIRGIN!\" Yeah yeah. I came here on a Sunday and instantly fell in love with all the knickknacks and large variety of rootbeer. This place is now a staple when I want to meet someone in that area of town. Oh, the food? The best! The sandwiches are so amazing. I've only had the cold veggie ones, but damn is their mustard good. Good music, they were playing Weezer and Nat King Cole upstairs.They obviously know the way to  my heart."}
{"text":"What a cute little place...well not that little. It's like a specialty food shop/knick knack/coffe shop with a deli and a patio with live music wine bar.

I got the D.A.M sandwich and macaroni salad. The sandwich was delicious. Pullpork in a not super sticky, more savory, bbq sauce, cole slaw on top on an onion roll. This place can definitely do pulled pork correctly, it was a tiny bit dry, but still great flavor and piled high. The macaroni salad was whatever. A lil too mayonaisey and not much flavor. I should have tried the pasta salad or one of the other variety of sides in the refridgerated section. You can also get kettle chips. They have fountain soda or bottled or glass/bottle wine available. Pricing seemed fair. Mine was 8 or 9 bucks for a 4oz side and a sandwich. 

My cousin got the ham w/ spinach and some kind of mayo. She said it was good. And her friend got the sandwich with the genoa salami, she also said it wast tasty.

Theres plently of seating outside, a little cubby to the side of the stairs, and apparently seating upstairs as well.

When I am in town again I want to return to try another yumfest sandwich. I love em!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a breakfast burrito - it was satisfactory, but honestly nothing to write home about. It's a nice little place, within walking distance of home, so I'll probably be back to check out some more of the menu.

I like the store - lots of interesting sauces and seasonings, looks like mostly local companies. I bought a bottle jalapeno and onion barbecue sauce which turned out to be delicious. I'd like to think I'll do some of my shopping here if I ever get around to cooking my own food."}
{"text":"We visited for the annual Local First Fall Festival. There was no parking available, so we had to go across the street. There were also too many people, so crowding and navigation were problematic. There were a good number of tents offering free samples. It was great to try food from several local places, since we got to discover new places to visit later. Unfortunately, none were selling food, so we couldn't also get lunch on the spot and had to go elsewhere for a full meal. I like this event as a way to try food samples and explore potential places to visit in the future."}
{"text":"Ok based on people's review I was expecting fabulous - husband and I went in one night for some soup and sammies - both of our meals were mediocre at best - won't be back until we have exhausted all other options - 

Food quality was ok - the bread was nothing to write home about (and is that not what makes a sammie?) - veggies were fresh and deli meat was meh.  Sorry - I wanted to love it -"}
{"text":"The cheese selection is very large and reasonably priced for the kinds of cheese available. That is not to say that duck and decanter is cheap. I prefer the staff at the north central location over this location. Duck and Decanter almost has a monopoly on unique cheeses, coffees, teas, etcs. The only other real option is AJ's and the prices there are exorbitant."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Duck location for the past several months and it never disappoints. I love that it is a family run business. All of the employees are very friendly and helpful. The sandwiches are excellent and they are not shy with the ingredients. They might seem a bit higher priced, but you are paying for quality! And the portions are large so it's worth it.  I have been ordering the Imported Ham - the Duck Way lately and boy is it tasty! I like that this restaurant is open for breakfast, lunch and happy hour because often I need all three for those late or stressful days at the office."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff, great sandwiches, and nice eating area to enjoy it all with my girlfriend!"}
{"text":"One of the great staples in Phoenix, the Duck is one of those places I've been going to for years--as have most Phoenicians.  You cant go wrong with their huge selection of gourmet deli meats and cheeses.  Their basic \"nooner\" sandwich has been around forever and we always get great service.  

Of course, the wine bar/pub area is kind of a locals secret getaway with a huge wine cellar and some tasty beers on tap--especially during fall patio time.  If you're ready for a sandwich that is a cut above your standard deli chain, I would recommend trying the Duck."}
{"text":"These sandwiches make my head explode.  And I don't even really like sandwiches.  Their creations are so unique and so full of flavor that you don't even feel like you're eating a sandwich.  When I eat them I see unicorns and rainbows and....okay not really but they are seriously good.  So far the Hot One is my favorite....tender brisket is some kind of amazing marinade and the horseradish really makes the sandwich.  The Vermont Treat is also very good.  I ended up with cheese spread smeared all over my face and I didn't care because I was in sandwich heaven.  My other fav is the Dutch Treat.  This one is not for everyone but it's loaded with flavor.  The relish and that champagne mustard.....ohhhh drool.  There is also a cool little market where you can buy all kinds of interesting imported goods and a wine bar area.  Check it out people!  This place is fantastic."}
{"text":"Duck and Decanter is more than just a sandwich shop for me.

As a young girl, I would frequently come to D&D with my dad. We would always get sandwiches, and I would be allowed to get a prize from the toy chest (not sure if they have it anymore). It was a place where we got to spend time together and bond, which was rare because as an  OB/GYN, my dad was frequently on call and at work. 

I was pleased to recently find out that after all of these years, Duck and Decanter has not lost its honey feel, warm ambiance, and quality of their food. 

This June, I took my dad there for Father's Day lunch. The sandwiches were as good as I remember. Nothing extravagant or peculiar, just classic sandwiches. Fresh breads, crispy lettuce, vine ripened tomatoes (among other things) and yummy mayonnaise. Not to mention their meat is very high quality and fresh-- all still at the amazing quality I remember as a young girl- fantastic. 

The staff is nice, helpful and super friendly. They give the place a warm feel to it. 

While you're there, make sure to shop around a bit, as they do have quite a few little trinkets and specialty food items like hot sauces, chocolates, and jams. All of their items are fairly moderately priced as well. 

To eat, you can either go upstairs to their loft area, sit on their tucked away yet lively patio, or in the lobby area of the restaurant. All places are nice, clean, and family friendly! 

Duck and Decanter is truly a great place to get a great quality sandwich and spend some quality time with the family."}
{"text":"I forgot about this place until we spotted it while driving after hiking North Mountain.  We always liked their sandwiches.  I had the hot Swedish Brisket with a side of horseradish.  Now I know why the brisket is a little on the sweet side.  It's to extinguish the horseradish!  Really cleared my sinus.  My son and nephew split the Turkey Croissant with Swiss Cheese.  Forgot the they hate that cheese.  So out it comes.  I don't like Swiss either, so I can't even eat what they put aside.  My husband had the Briescutto.  Now that just melts in your mouth good!  Great place to add calories after you try burning it!"}
{"text":"Love The Duck!! Great deli sandwiches! Service is good too!! Say hello to Gloria when you stop by!!"}
{"text":"I dig the Duck.  I don't even really know what to call it.  Part store, part bar, part deli, part someone's living room who doesn't make you feel guilty about not helping with the dishes, only catch being you actually have to pay for your wine and cheese (which I'm totally fine with if it means I don't feel guilty for not helping with the dishes).

Basically the duck has everything you could possibly need dispersed at different locations around what appears to be a large cabin with a lush green park in front.  You get your items (wine, coffee, sandwiches, whatever) and you mosey around, find a place to sit and enjoy them, just like you would in your own backyard, except your own backyard probably doesn't have as extensive of a wine collection or an award winning cheese department (and if it does, I officially hate you).

I like to come here for happy hour (M-F, til 7:00, $2 off house wine and draft beer) or on Sunday afternoons to do a little daydrinking and people watching.  I don't have kids or a dog, but people that do seem to love this place.  Normally I don't prefer my wine with children (probably why I don't have kids), but the Duck's overall mellow environment somehow soothes me to the point that I find myself actually enjoying the presence of the mini-humans. And if I enjoy anywhere enough to actually consider motherhood, it's probably worth at least a dozen or so stars, but Yelp only goes up to five so five it is."}
{"text":"Delicious food and drinks. This place is always busy so it takes a while to get your food. But it's worth the wait. The Avocado sandwich is yummy for my fellow vegetarians! They also have a gluten free bread option. And you can have as many pickle spears as you'd like which I Iove! The tea selection is great too!"}
{"text":"This place was great! We drove past it and ended up walking back, but we sure were glad we did. 
1. It's a restaurant and a market. I love this kind of place. It gives you the chance to grab a meal and a snack or souvenir. 
The guy that took our order was super helpful about answering our questions about the menu, and gave us a tip on the hike we were heading to after lunch. 
2. There is outdoor dining. Two separate outside areas. I noticed there were stairs inside, but I did not check out where they went. I'm not sure if it was more market, or more dining room. 
3. The food was really good. I had my \"go to\" a ham and cheese croissant, and my hubs had the rueben and a cup of soup. You have your choice of all sorts of sides. You can get something they have pre prepared or grab a bag of chips or a cookie or whatever in the market area that strikes your fancy! 
4. They sell wine and beer! 

It's tucked back behind Copenhagen furniture and DXL Clothing, so that's why we missed it. I could not see it from the road, and google maps failed me a bit. So look for those two signs and you will be able to park right outside."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to the D&D for a few years and then, yesterday, friends suggested it as a meeting spot. I had forgotten about their lovely tucked away setting, the ability to order a sandwich EXACTLY like I want it and that they have both wine and live music. Upstairs is a nice variety of seating where it is quiet enough to hold a small meeting or read or just enjoy conversation with a friend. The large windows let in plenty of day light and the nature photos on the walls are just spectacular. If you have a need for a kitchen gadget or a small gift, it's also worth perusing their market. Yesterday a local musician performed while a number of people sat outside with their lunch or wine glass. If you've ever heard of biophilic design, this place has it and I believe it is why people feel so comfortable here. By the way, their soups, sandwiches and salads are very good. The counter help is friendly and if you're in the area, it should be your go to sandwich spot."}
{"text":"Overpriced - go to Trader Joe's across the street if you're looking for any deli. I love walking into new places and this one was packed even though it was right after lunch. The sandwiches are good, if you can remember to have them toasted. One sandwich, one cup of soup, one bag of chips, one drink, sixteen buck. Seriously?"}
{"text":"So, I've been going to this place for years, not b/c the food blows my mind, but rather it hits the spot. Plus, I love sitting on the patio drinking wine when the weather is nice with my best gal. 

Anyhow, my other best gal, my mom had never tried this spot. I  thought Duck would be great for a quick casual lunch. She's a vegetarian so we ordered the Where's the Beef sandwich to share. It took about 20 minutes to make the sandwich, which feels like an eternity when your hungry.

When I glanced at the sandwich I thought perhaps they had added some portobello mushrooms to it. Turns out, the dark brown layer was actually rotten avocado. REALLY!!!!??? I mean come on! Avocado is like prime rib to vegetarians. How can you F this up? It was truly nasty. It got me to thinking, if someone actually put this into the sandwich, what else would their low standards allow them to place into an unsuspecting victims sammie. It's not like they make them with blindfolds on. I was really grossed out.

When I brought it to the manager's attention, she didn't seem that bothered by it. They remade half a sandwich for me, and that was that.

It was annoying b/c I left feeling that Duck & Decanter takes for granted the fact that loyal customers will stick with them no matter what. Well, not this one.

Plus, that place needs a serious dusting. Yuck."}
{"text":"Tried it again. Still not good. Great service! Cute store. Sandwich just not good. I tried the tuna on white rye. First of all not sure why he recommended that for a to go and eat in the car option. Not easy... But the flavors were just not there. Oh well."}
{"text":"I like Duck, roasted and with some plum sauce on the side. I'm not so excited about Duck & Decanter. It's just okay for me, 2 1/2 stars if I had that option since I'm only interested in lunch and not their wine or any of the fancy foodstuffs that they carry. The best attribute about this place is the outdoor seating while being surrounded by some large trees.

For starters, there's a funky smell going on when you first walk into the place. I think the sandwiches are weak. You can look at a picture of my Reuben Sandwich with the toasted burnt bread and judge for yourself. To me, it looks like a number eight hitter's batting average, weak. I've had a decent salad in the past as well. 

This place has definitely not made the cut on to my regular lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I met a friend the other day at Duck and Decanter. I had always wondered about this place because, an East Coast transplant, I assumed that it was some kind of a pub/restaurant typical of big Northeast cities. It was the name that threw me. I was completely taken by surprise when I entered. It is a deli/market/bakery combo. Think Cracker Barrel merged with Le Grand Orange sprinkled with Which Wich. Fascinating concept!

The sandwich that I ordered was delicious and I took a heap of pickles that come with. I managed to avoid buying anything else like chips or baked goods, but did so with a sad heart. Everything looked wonderful. My friend and I had a great lunch and leisurely talked for hours. No wait staff came to give us dirty looks or cleared our plates as we took our last bites. It was a good experience and I will definitely come again. Next time I will eat some sweets, browse the store, sit on the patio with my dog, and listen to the music outside - of course, not all at once."}
{"text":"I went to duck & decanter with a friend of mine from work on a whim, and really enjoyed it!  You order and pick up at the counter, and while you're waiting you can look around in their little shop.  They have a snack section too where you can pick something up to go with your sandwich.  I tried a bag of the popped sour cream and onion chips, which were awesome.  These are not unique to D&D though.

As for the main course, I got the D.A.M. Sandwich.  This bad boy is pork roast rubbed with southwestern spices, slow-cooked, pulled, and marinated in a jalapeño and onion barbeque sauce, topped off with their special coleslaw, and served on a onion roll.  Holy amazing.  One of the messier sandwiches I've had, but I was too busy nomming it to care.  The portion size was generous, but that doesn't mean I wasn't left wanting more!

The restaurant itself is fun, with several indoor and outdoor seating areas.  I sat in a little nook in the back wine cellar area with just a few tables.  They have a separate wine bar back there where you can choose from any of their wines, if you're into that kind of thing.  They have a good selection of non-alcoholic beverages as well.

I'm not normally into sandwich places, but I really can't wait to go back and try it again.  Once I've had the option to try other things and get a better feel for the place, I may revise this review and bump them to 5 stars."}
{"text":"The first time I was taken to \"The Duck\" was six years ago when my (now hubby) took me there for lunch. I had just flown in from Seattle to meet him (we met online) and we were staying at Squaw Peak so this was a quick jaunt away from the resort. As mezmerized as I was by the uniqueness of AZ and the ecleticness of the area, \"The Duck\" was like something I had never experienced before. (So you can imagine my surprise when this Seattlelite saw MISTERS for the first time!) 

The food is fabulous...gourmet sandwiches, salads, chips...I'm hungry just thinking about it! I feel the Duck lends itself to the quick lunch, the relaxing lunch spent listening to the live music or to GIRL TIME with delicious cheese/salads and WINE! And their little gift shop has SO many wonderful things in it...most especially the TEA! I feel safe in saying that \"The Duck\" very possibly has the BEST iced tea I've ever enjoyed. (Well, it is RIGHT up there with PF Chang's and The GreenHouse at the very least!)

Please do youself and flavor...visit D & D and see for yourself what all the buzz is about...you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Last time I visited Duck & Decanter I was very disappointed. I have been visiting this place since high school and it has always been great but for some reason this time everything was off. My sandwich bread was hard and inedible, the topping were sparse, and the pasta salad was just not good."}
{"text":"My mom used to take me to \"The Duck\" as a child and it is still a favorite. 

This hidden gem has some of the best sandwiches in Phoenix. Plus, it's situated in a cool old building with a loft, wine bar, adorable outdoor area, and gift shop. You can find just about anything here. 

Their ingredients are fresh and I've never eaten something I didn't like. They also have the best Moroccan mint tea I've ever had!

Duck & Decanter is the perfect lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I'm the very rare Phoenician who has been born and raised here. Most of the older, more established places really resonate with all of us, since we've frequented them so much throughout the years....or at least that is me. For those whom aren't from here, or do not know of Duck and Decanter, all you need to know is that this is THE ONLY BROWN BAG PLACE YOU NEED TO KNOW OF. Period.

**The Layout**
As soon as you walk in, you see a number of things First you will notice the fun food items and nick-knacks on shelves, all usable and able to be purchased for use in your kitchen. Off to your left you will also see a coffee bar which is directly in front of the wine room. Each offer excellent products as well as experienced servers who can help you decide further. You also will see on the left wall a large selection of extremely high quality coffees from around the globe. Finally, to the right a large deli section with fridges filled with the same meats, cheeses, and sides you enjoyed in your sandwich

**Fud**
The food is excellent, of course. Everything used is waaaaay above the quality of normal sandwich shops. You have a wide selection of fresh made pasta options as well as soups and other various sides. Its truly up to you to make your own brown bag special. My favorite is the Sonoran Chicken, with a wheat bread blend and swiss or provolone.... You can't go wrong with anything here guys. The staff work hard and care about your experience.

**What else?!?!**
They have awesome music events planned out each week utilizing the patio out front. It is a two story building, so you can go upstairs and go up their for a group event if wanted.

ENJOY EVERYONE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the place you'd bring someone named \"Aunt Maude\" or \"Cousin Gertrude.\" I swear this is my lasting thought upon departing this venue. After hearing it mentioned as a good lunch option by a handful of people, I went for a quick bite with some coworkers today.

The service was friendly, albeit a bit slow. I had eaten through my entire bag of chips before my sandwich was ready. The Duckling was my choice - turkey, smoked duck, cream cheese, cranberry bread. Including drink it was nearly $12. Bit steep for a deli-type experience. 

The sandwich was just ok, and that is not really ok for $9. The duck wasn't very tasty and its weak flavor kinda got overwhelmed by the cranberry and cream cheese. Perhaps this is wasn't odd, I don't know: I'm simply used to the tasty assertion of roasted or Peking-style duck. Possibly a faulty comparison, but that's what I was looking forward to. 

I'd like to possibly try some other sandwiches, but I won't be in any hurry to return."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY....one of my favorite sandwich shops! There are lots of seats upstairs, but my wife and I prefer to hang in the cute little wine bar... Go figure. Unfortunately it seems every time we stop in it's a bit hot to eat outside, but we keep meaning to sit there someday.

Lots of local items for sale, both palatable and not. On our last visit we had been out shopping for a piece of art for our living room and stopped in for lunch. When we were waiting for our sandwich to show up we spotted a beautiful framed photo which was exactly what we were looking for. BONUS! 

Enjoy"}
{"text":"My co-worker had a coupon for a buy one get one free sandwich and we decided to do this for lunch today. I happen to LOVE duck and when i saw the duckling on the menu I knew i had to try it. It is smoked duck beast & smoked turkey breast with cream cheese & cranberry sauce with spicy sprouts & spring greens on wheat walnut cranberry bread. I loved it, even though it is a little on the sweet side and i tend to eat foods more in the savory or spicy categories. 
We went to the downtown location & it was a bit of a drive for us coming from the Tempe area & parking in downtown at lunch is always a challenge. 
It was a really nice treat, but a little pricey for a lunch sandwich, especially when you add on the time to get there and some change for the parking meters. Might visit again if I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"If I could give them minus 100 stars, I would do so. 
My partner and I live in Central Phoenix and had friends from San Diego in for a visit last weekend.  After showing them around town on Sunday, Dec. 29th we were all hungry around 1pm. With the numerous dining options in Central Phoenix we decided to go to the Duck and Decanter on E. Camelback.  Friends in town have been raving about that place for years and now this was our opportunity to try it and show our friends a good time.  We arrived last Sunday a little after 1pm.  Outside was very busy but managed to find a an empty table for the four of us.  I decided to wait at the table to save it as it was the last one available. The others went inside to place our orders. My first impression was. Not good. There was no landscaping, vegetation or flowers. Felt like we were sitting on a concrete slab in the shopping center parking lot.  Also looked a bit trashy with several dirty tables left unattended. Ambiance a big Zero.  After about 25 mins of waiting outside at the table the rest of my party came out with brown paper bags and drink cups.  In that amount of time we could of had a fabulous sit down and served lunch at one of the many great cafés in the neighborhood. They said it was busy ordering the food and only two persons working behind the line taking orders.  On a busy Sunday afternoon this is unacceptable. I ordered a BLT on sourdough bread with a side of coleslaw.  For almost $8.00 per sandwich they could afford to be a little less chinsy with them. The sourdough bread was just cheap white bread that you can buy at the grocery for 99 cents per loaf.  There were exactly 2 slices of over cooked bacon with a piece of brown wilted lettuce on mayo.  The only ingredient they were generous with was the whole tomato that was sliced and piled on the sandwich to make it appear that it was a heartier sandwich.  I didn't order a big fat tomato and mayo sandwich. Shame on you Duck and Decenter.  My side of coleslaw was practically inedible.  Coleslaw swimming in watered down slaw sauce (more like mayonnaise and warm milk) was not at all tasty.  Another person in my party ordered an over priced spinach salad with barely any spinach.  She never told them when ordering yo hold the spinach. Really people!!!! Also she had to wait another 25 mins to get her ice tea because she was told that they had run out. Couldn't they have told her when she ordered it and let her make a different drink choice.  While eating our less than acceptable meal a man was playing the guitar and singing.  He sounded okay but his volume was way way to loud. We literally could not even coo in ate with each other being at least 50 feet away from him.  This total experience at the Duck and Decanter left a bitter taste in my mouth and not just from the awful food. We will never be back.  They can keep their lousy service, inedible over priced food and \"cluck it\"."}
{"text":"Wine, beer, indoor and outdoor seating, and a little shop!

This was my second time at Duck & Decanter, this place is great if you want to pick up a delicious bowl of soup & sandwich.  Duck and Decanter has more of a market feel vibe with a lunch board where they serve up some unique sandwiches you won't find at a normal deli or sandwich shop.  

You order at the counter, wait for your name to be called, take a seat, and enjoy your meal. Today, we decided to dine outdoors. The outdoor dining area was perfect. Just the right combination of shade and sun, it was ideal. I can't think of a better way to spend  a lunch hour - eating, talking, relaxing.

My lunch companions had the beef brisket chili & 1/2 Ruben sandwich. Both said the Ruben was the best they ever had. I had the Smokey with ham. One of the best sandwiches I have ever had! The cheese was perfectly melted and seemed to cover ever piece of the ham.

After, you dine take a look around the store.  The market area has a good mix of items from all over the globe and the bar area has a good selection of beer and wine. 

If you ever find yourself in the area or your  just looking for good soup and sandwiches stop by you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Duck and Decanter is one of those places where while eating your meal, you suddenly think, \"Wait. Am I still in Phoenix?\" 

This place is SO unlike anything else in midtown Phoenix that going there for the atmosphere is half the pleasure. It's part sandwich shop, part eclectic boutique, part wine cellar, part loft. And some other things thrown in too. 

Tucked away in a corner of a generic strip mall the place looks like someone's house from the 70's. Hard to describe. Once you enter there is a counter where you place your order with a little salad case, a cheese case, and a dessert case. Once you get your sandwich (or salad), you can either sit outside on the patio or take the stairs up to the upper dining area. Or sit on the upper deck outside patio. 

And yeah, the sandwiches can get a bit pricey but like I said, half the fun of the place is the atmosphere. I've always enjoyed my sandwich. It's not like I'm paying for something I don't like. The breads and the 'fixin's' have always been fresh and full of flavor. 

Go get a sandwich, do a little browsing, relax, and take in some people watching. 

And if you can figure out what city the place reminds you of, please let me know. Cause it's not Phoenix, for sure."}
{"text":"Yes! What a satisfying and lovely feeling I have after leaving Duck and Decanter. The layout of this restaurant is like a delicatessen labyrinth. The employees are cheerful, earnest and helpful in their suggestions and the food? Fantastic! 

I ordered a black forest bacon breakfast burrito and was surprised by the lack of girth. However, what it lacked in sized, it made up in taste! This tightly rolled burrito was bursting with flavor and the crispy delicious bacon was a constant exclamation point throughout the burrito. Easily one of my top 3 best breakfast burritos I have ever had. Ever. I look forward to grinding through another one of those bad-boys out on that awesome patio in the near near future."}
{"text":"Delicious Chicken Curry sandwich. As I was not too hungry I got a \"mini\" sandwich and a cup of soup. I was still stuffed and happy after eating it. The sandwich was one of the best Chicken Curry Sandwiches I have had for a long time. The bread tasted fresh and the cheddar they use is definitely not a cheap variety. I loved the juicy little fat raisins my curry mix. So yummy. The soup was Split Pea with Ham and was pipping hot (lukewarm soup is a pet peeve of mine) and tasted delicious. They throw in some little gourmet style croutons but I was so stuffed I did not even add them. The best part of my experience there? They had slices of dill pickles next to the cash register! When the lady saw me eyeing them she said, \"Help yourself to as many as you want honey\". Oh My God. I have died and gone to heaven. A girl can never have too many pickles, I grabbed two and they made for a delicious snack later while I waited for my flight at the airport."}
{"text":"I've never seen a real duck at this Decanter, but I'm pretty sure that if they knew what a great little treat this local business is, they'd be lining up and quaking to be let in. 

Duck and Decanter is an adorable little local deli, wine bar and gift shop in Phoenix. With a perfect patio to enjoy lunch on a nice day and a gift shop with unique finds to browse through while you wait for your sandwich, it's an enjoyable experience all around. 

The food here is freshly made and up to gourmet par. They have a selection of cheeses to satisfy any dairy like and the wine is equivalently nice. I like to visit the Duck when I want a quality lunch and need it in a short period of time. My go-to sandwich is the ham and brie with honey mustard. It's a big sandwich too so I always have a left-over afternoon snack. They have a huge selection of drinks and chips -- including baked lays and for the times when my sweet tooth takes over, they have a variety of brownies, cookies and candy as well. 

I always enjoy browsing through the gift shop and it's a perfect stop if looking for a unique gift that's off the beaten path. Duck also supports local AZ so they have several events throughout the year with local businesses and promote other local happenings around town. 

The wine bar is intimate and full of spectacular vinos. I always forget about the wine bar and need to remember to visit more often. 

All in all, Duck and Decanter is a true treat for my taste buds every time I visit. If you're in a hurry, call ahead and place an order to pick up because it can get pretty busy during lunch time. They also deliver!"}
{"text":"Yep another 4 stars award goes to the ducky. 

Again, thank you yelp for introducing me to this place where everything is oh so calm and content all the time.

The cheese plate will leave you speechless along with a great vino."}
{"text":"This is a really neat place to have lunch. You place your order inside and then take a seat outside in the patio. It looks like a small Trader Joe's when you're inside with an antique feel to it. 

You really can't go wrong with anything you order. Everything is fresh. The bread is amazing. The sandwiches are huge. The soup is full of flavor. 

We found another new go-to-spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"I love the Duck! My mom has taken me here for years growing up and I always loved their sammies and pickles. This last weekend a friend hosted a bridal shower for me on the patio and it was an amazing time.

I didn't know you could reserve a private patio and it had the perfect mix of sun and shade. We had sammies and fruit salad catered and bought a few bottles of champagne. What else do you really need for a good time?

We ended up staying a little longer than our 3 hour reservation and never felt any pressure to hurry up or leave. We still heard the live music and got the energy of the other patrons while having our privacy.

Food was tasty as always. Fresh veggies, hearty bread and I love that pine nuts are in the veggie. One of the best lunch spots ever!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday. They have a nice outside patio. That you can reserve. Great options for sandwiches & wine. I absolutely love these types of places where it's a deli but also a great little shop with crazy jams, sauces, teas & cookwares."}
{"text":"I love being in downtown Phoenix and this was a perfect lunch spot ! I love their other location as well on Camelback.  I'm always happy with their fresh food and great service - another must go if you haven't yet !"}
{"text":"This is by far the best place in Phoenix for an afternoon with family and friends for sandwiches. Sit outside on a beautiful fall or spring afternoon and sometimes you can catch some live music.
They also have a nice wine bar with a good selection by the bottle or glass. The Duck offers spices, cookbooks, and unique gifts for last minute shopping.
I have been coming to the Duck for over 20 years and highly recommend it. Watch out for the weekly lunch rush though. It gets extremely busy and problematic if you have somewhere to be."}
{"text":"Have only eaten lunch here, and the sandwiches are very good.  Not your plain, average run-of the mill sandwiches, either.  Healthy portions and excellent sides."}
{"text":"Honest sandwiches with fresh ingredients. The duck sandwich with spring salad was fantastic. There is a lovely patio and plenty of indoor seating as well. The price is a bit high for a sandwich though."}
{"text":"Decent place for lunch. It was my first time here, and the food was good (very large portions), but I have had better sandwiches at other delis. I am very close to this location, so I will still stop in, for sure. Great spot for lunch!.. Enough food to make for a second meal! (or to share with a friend)"}
{"text":"\"What's good on the menu?  It's my first time here.\"
\"Everything. Or it wouldn't be on the menu.\"
\"Haha, okay.\" Really what I'm thinking, \"Easy there, Tiger.  I'm about to check-in and Yelp! about you.\" 

Cute store with lots international stuff you can't get at a grocery store. Ordered the The Hot Sandwich, which was just average. Bread was soggy, but meat was tender and tasty.  The second order was a Genoa sandwich, which turned into a tuna salad sandwich.  Took it back and waited almost 10 minutes while my boyfriend ate by himself upstairs.  Sandwich was pretty good.  I liked the aoili sauce and the meat was thick sliced.  Had it at home later hot.  

I was hoping I could get comped with a cookie since they kept staring back at me the whole time, or ask where I was sitting and they would bring it to me.  
Oh well,  we will give it another shot.  I want to buy some goodies in there."}
{"text":"The pros: 
- fresh ingredients
- attention to detail 
- variety of foods, snacks, goodies and drinks

The cons:
- expensive
- location / parking inconvenient

Brief review:
All in all, a good place to hang out and grab a drink with a friend when it's nice outside. Friendly, prompt service. Clean tables. Great atmosphere!  The only real problem is your wallet is going to be much, much lighter after you leave.  If you're going because you're hungry and you want value, this isn't your place.  If you're going to hang with friends to relax and enjoy the day, I think you'll enjoy the place."}
{"text":"Great spot. Fantastic sandwhiches. Friendly service. Nice wine and beer selectiom. Family owned. They have a great selection of coffees and teas, sauces, chocolates. Wonderful place to take an out of towner for a lunch. Keep it up D & D."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful deli. It's the only place I've found that has edible gluten-free bread. The food is always delicious and the staff gives good small town friendly service. They truly appreciate their customers and take pride in their work."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch.

Tip: Try to get there before/after the lunch crowd hits.

I ordered \"The Whole Thing\" sandwich.  Piled high with ham, turkey, and salami.  This is an awesome sandwich.

Make sure to try their iced tea which is always fresh brewed and has different flavors daily.

Friendly staff and an interesting selection of gourmet items, wine, cheese and other things to buy as well."}
{"text":"Delicious little sandwich spot.  I'd recommend here for a sandwich if you're in the area over any of the chains.

Try the past salad."}
{"text":"Sophie B. has me very confused:  You can get a sandwich & a drink for like under $10 bucks @ the Duck.

All the sandwiches are handmade right in front of your very face -- any time a restaurant prepares the food where the whole wide world can watch them do it tells me they're proud of their work & their food.  And they should be -- it's great!  They even have each pickle wedge individually wrapped in foil -- take as many as you want (within reason).   :-)

I've been a customer of the Duck since long before most of you moved to Phoenix.  Consistency -- nice people, excellent food, reasonable prices, wide selections of wines & soft drinks, seating indoors - outdoors - upstairs.  

No worries - The Duck is always good."}
{"text":"This place is unlike any other. First of all, the name is unusual. The restaurant is tucked away and has trees surrounding the building. It almost feels like you're away from Arizona. The place is set up like a deli but also like a small store and a coffee bar and an art gallery and a patio space...super unique. I love the selection of foods and beverages. Ordering is simple (that is when you know what you want) and you have a chance to browse through the aisles as you wait for your order. They also have a loft space upstairs to enjoy your food but there's seating downstairs and outside on multiple patios. Perfect place for a weekday lunch or a brunch with your friends."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to get a deli sandwich. They are nice and piled high on the freshest bread. You get to choose what goes on your sandwich. There are a lot of side items to choose from as well like potato salad, pasta, etc. I am a huge fan of their iced coffee! It also doubles as a store so you can find cute little trinkets and unique grocery items. Hey, if you want chips or candy with your sandwich, you can pick it off the shelf and enjoy it then. They even have a little doggie station with treats and a water bowl."}
{"text":"Why did I originally give Duck and Decanter a four star rating??? So much ridiculous. This is my favorite lunch spot in the entire city. I love their deli options, I love the people, I love the seating (both indoor and out), and I love love love their sandwiches! If you've never been here, you need to try it. It is the perfect deli. Look for me when you visit, I'm pretty much a regular..."}
{"text":"Duck and Decanter is surprisingly uninspired food.  I wouldn't recommend this as a meal for a downtown diner unless your choices are down to this and Quizno's.  My prosciutto sandwich was dreadfully boring, equal to something you'd probably get in a nice, fancypants hospital like the Mayo Clinic.  There, it would be awesome, but here, as a downtown staple is not noteworthy whatsoever."}
{"text":"Duck & Decanter is my go to spot for supreme sandwiches, so dang tasty!

I cannot testify for the entire menu, I have 2 favorites that I keep going between. But I can attest to how delish their coconut macaroons are, they are soft, moist and sweet, perfectly cooked on the outside and soft and tender on the inside. Also they carry Fairytale Brownies, and I know those are bomb! 

My 2 favorite sandwiches right now are the Vermont Treat & Sonoran Chicken.  The Sonoran Chicken has a spicy oil & vinegar sauce like and has jicama, bell peppers, cilantro, corn and green onions with chicken all mixed together and I always pick to have it on ciabatta bread with Swiss cheese, tomatoes and some lettuce, omg this is such a great sandwich! So good I crave it at times! The Vermont is a maple glazed ham sandwich with pine nuts, spinach, sliced apples and cheddar cheese, omg this is heaven on bread!  The blend of the ham cheese and apples are amazing, beautiful flavors happening their!

This location is pretty sweet too, there is seating upstairs as well as downstairs, and on the weekends there is live music out in the patio area. And there is a even a beer & wine garden and a cozy fireplace too!

Yep this Duck & Decanter is becoming a favorite of mine. I'm sure I'll be back in no time."}
{"text":"The ol' D and D. A quiet and lovely sandwich shop/bar in an otherwise boring shopping ce of Central Phoenix.

Each time I come here after work it is slow and the service is excellent. The bar is usually staffed by older employees while the sandwich counter has younger but still very nice employees crafting tasty eats.

The jalapeno havarti cheese is absolutely wonderful on a sonoran chicken salad sandwich. I believe the best reviews of this restaurant probably have taken full advantage of the customizable menu options. It does boost the price of the average sandwich up though. I almost always get pine nuts and pepperoncinis in addition to the standard options and the sandwich ends up being 9 dollars or so. A bit pricey but completely worth it.

As mentioned in numerous other reviews there are multiple seating options. An outdoor patio, tables next to the wines and bar area, tables at the east end of the lower floor and upstairs which are accessed via staircase at the east side of the sandwich/grocery area.

There is a great selection of deli meats and cheeses at the west end of the sandwich counter. A very respectable selection of tea, coffee and other local goods. Including hot sauces, coffee cups and various small gifts.

Great place to hang out on a Friday after work and listen to some live music while drinking a craft beer and enjoying their patio with a fire place.

A note to those parking here. The spots for customers is between the office building and the parking structure just south of the building."}
{"text":"Great lunch! Pretty darn good sandwiches! Gift shop, big bags of chips, and a great deli counter selection! They have a wine cellar with a great selection (not a HUGE selection) of hand picked great wine. Seating is outdoor, indoor, and upstairs in a little loft.  It is a casual place and a Phoenix local staple."}
{"text":"Sandwich is awesome at this place. I usually get tuna (so good). The last time I did half egg and half tuna. Amazing. Keep up the good y'all I enjoy this place. Happy customer here."}
{"text":"I always forget about Duck & Decanter, and then as soon as I visit again, I'm reminded about how pleasant it is to eat here.

At first glance, the menu can seem a little overwhelming - so many choices!  And they all sound so delicious!  But as someone who can be a little picky at times, I really appreciate the ability to easily customize my sandwich, or better yet, just build my own!  There is also an extensive choice of sides, sweets and beverages to chose from!  And while you're waiting for them to make your sandwich, check out the cool (unique!) stuff they carry!  A great place to pick up souveniers for visitors or a gift for a friend.  The patio (in nice weather) is very nice with wonderful mature trees, and the music that is available from time to time adds to the ambience."}
{"text":"Duck and Decanter is not the type of place that offers tons of crazy unique sandwiches. If your idea of a good sandwich involves shaved truffles and roquefort cheese, this is not your restaurant. The sandwiches are generally straightforward, using common ingredients.

However, the reason I keep returning over and over is because I very much like standard deli sandwiches, and I've never had better ones than at D&D. (A simple ham-turkey-salami-cheddar on ciabatta is my usual.) The bread is fresh and soft, the meat is flavorful and shaved very thin, and the portion sizes are just right for me."}
{"text":"I really want to like Duck and Decanter - but I'm not impressed.  I've been there once before but never went back and didn't realize why it was forgettable.  I decided to try it again since there is a high rating on yelp and I ordered the Briesciutto. The flavor wasn't bad, but the bread was so chewy that I felt like I was gonna chew forever.  The sandwich was pretty small and all you get is a sandwich for $8.25.  Well, you can also grab a piece of chewy taffy while you pay.  They have outdoor seating which is pretty nice where you can hang out, read a book, and even bring your dog.  I saw a sign that said they welcome dogs on the patio which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"I just don't get it.  Why would you pay such a high price for such a mundane and uninspired sandwich?  I had the garlic chicken (which wasn't very garlicky and just seemed like glorified chicken salad) sandwich and really wasn't impressed.  I also opted for a ridiculously priced Greek salad- coming out to over five bucks for eight ounces.  It just wasn't amazing in any stretch of imagination, and nowhere near the money it cost.

The actual building is of some interest.  I enjoy that you can eat upstairs and they'll clip your sandwich to a sack and send it up to you.  The front patio was inviting.  However, the layout doesn't really lend itself to an efficient order.  The nonalcoholic drinks are set in the back, while the alcohol is set in another room entirely.  The bathrooms are pretty much like a public park restroom- and just as dirty.  

I understand that it is locally owned and has somehow been voted best sandwich for something like thirty years, but eh, unless you're craving an overpriced, and ordinary sandwich... I'd skip it."}
{"text":"This might surprise you, but this place doesn't have servers. I was expecting a sit-down-and-order experience, but was wrong and I've talked to others who've thought the same thing (there are places to sit it's just more like a deli than a restaurant). Still, that shouldn't put you off...they make great sandwiches and on Mondays they have GREAT lunch specials!

Sometimes there is live music, which is real nice (especially if the performer is attractive and sometimes they are).

When I go I usually order the Avacado Sandwich or the Briesciutto."}
{"text":"I love a good sandwich shop! I really love Basha's deli and have been getting their sandwiches for lunch almost everyday when I lived out in Pinal County. I can hardly find a Bashas here around Phoenix but was waiting for a friend getting her oil change done on Camelback and seen this sandwich shop close by. We decided to check this place out for lunch wanting something light and this is one of the best spots we've been to for sandwiches! You get to pick what kind of bread you want along with meat. I went with the smoked turkey and added sprouts and avocado. My sandwich was so delicious! I'm glad I know a good place for a sandwich now!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, Duck & Decanter makes the BEST sandwiches in Phoenix. After all these years they're still untouchable. All their ingredients are top notch quality and freshness. I've eaten here countless times and hope to countless more."}
{"text":"I ordered the turkey 'build your own' with marble rye, done up the duck way, plus spinach and champagne mustard spread.  It was very very good with the softest bread and most flavorful tomatoes.  I thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich and the amazing selection of teas.  I refilled several times on the teas.  Additionally, the staff was extremely kind to my 41 students who got in line and ordered from the quality menu.  My students explored the displays, candy, drinks, and extensive menu items; we made reservations in advance with confidence that we chose a family owned business.  One student ordered the curry chicken and told everyone how excited she was to get good curry.  This is my 3rd visit and I am super satisfied."}
{"text":"I have to concur with Shannon and Sarah on this one. 

In high school, we used to get out n Friday's at 12:30 and then we would rendezvous with our lady friends for lunch. There were an amazingly high number of awkward teenage lunches that took place at this Duck and Decanter, until one day I realized that I really don't like the food there, or anything about it really. 

It somewhat effectively passes itself off as a gourmet sandwicheria/deli but more by pricing everything high than serving good sandwiches. 

I'll still drop by from time to time and still have friends from high school that love it, I just don't think I ever will. 

Two and a half stars."}
{"text":"I work in the area and don't always have time, or care, to pack my own lunch.  Plus I don't cook and you can only eat spaghetti so many times a week. 

This is why I love The Duck.  It's two blocks from my work which gives me a little \"wake me up\" walk and the outdoor seating is nice on the days when it's not too hot.  Yeah a sandwich will run you just under $10 with a drink but you get a massively huge sandwich.  Some days, I end up taking half of it home and eating it later.  

I always get their Avocado sandwich because I'm a vegetarian and it was so good the first time I was here that I've been unable to try anything else lest it not compare.  Co-workers of mine are fans of the curry chicken salad.  

There is plenty of seating so I usually suggest this place when meeting friends for lunch."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches and a little beer & wine bar in the back with a great bartender.  Bob is very knowledgable about everything they carry and what will best pair with your food.

Toast the bread and shoot the breeze for a great experience!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites! Every time I land in Phoenix I head straight to the place. Smokey Forest Ham on Croissant #todiefor"}
{"text":"first time in this place - extremely cute, cozy, and full of delicious treats. i wish i had more time to look around and explore but i was starving and my sandwich was ready within minutes.

i went with the nooner - the sandwich you can customize to YOUR liking. which is great because i'm a very picky eater when it comes to sandwiches - know what flavor combinations i like and i despise mayo, lettuce, and tomato on my sandwiches which is typical for most places to offer standard. but not at the duck, you order it exactly how you want it!

i went for the smoked turkey on dark rye, with sprouts, russian mustard, peppercinis, and the jalepeno havarti. i also ordered up a side of potato salad and was tempted to buy some cookies but i withheld. the sandwiches come with a pickle spear as well. i love that this place has so many choices to choose from - it was hard to just pick one - which means i'll have to come back and try other things. i looked at their take home menu and they're open at 7 and close at 9 and serve breakfast stuff all day. their coffee smelled delicious as well. 

back to the sandwich - delicious! the mustard was sooo good and must have had wasabi in it because i could feel it burn in my nose. the bread was soft and the turkey was tasty. the potato salad sucked, it had a strange taste to it - like it was watery or something. the pickle was not very good either. if this review were just for the sandwich it would be four stars. the lackluster potato salad and pickle aren't enough to stop me from coming back to the duck to savor the wide variety of other treats this place has to offer, including lots of wine and beer."}
{"text":"*Thumbs up* This place is has some really good sandwiches, more specifically the Duckling. Ofcourse you will taste the roasted duck in it, but what I'm pointing out here is that the flavor and goodness of this sandwich is truly amazing. It really hits the spot! Oh yeah, the coffee here is great too. Service was okay so it was all fine."}
{"text":"The Duck has been around a very long time. You can't go wrong with their chicken salad sandwich or the Duckling."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 20+ years and it used to be so much better.   

I placed a to go order last Saturday and the place that used to have a line out the door was dead. 

The  selection of sides/salads is much smaller than it used to be and every side had a 'crust' over them like they had been made and sitting out since the day before.   It was so unappealing that I really regretted ordering the macaroni salad (which indeed was average tasting at best.)

The sandwich I had, 'The Whole Thing' was very good.   My husband thought the 'Fiery Italian' was pretty nondescript and ended up throwing out half of it.

The outdoor seating area is nice, as are the servers.   I just wish the quality of the food hadn't slipped so much."}
{"text":"A PHX institution and rightly so.

Just basically straight up one of the best sandwich/lunch places in the whole Valley.  I always make sure to stop in on any visit back.

They have great coffees, cheeses, meats, and other gourmet selections as well...pretty much always worth the splurge while you are there.  

If you have a chance eat there if possible.  There is something wonderfully lazy about spending an hour or so at D&D...the beer and wine bar may add to this...as well as the decent patio seating.

I really can't expand too much on this very sparsely written review.  They do what they do...and they do it very well."}
{"text":"This truly is my fave deli in Phx. My friend Adan treated me to this lil secret spot and I decided to follow him on his food suggestion to get, THE D.A.M. SANDWICH. Pork roast rubbed with southwestern spices, pulled and marinated in a jalapeño and onion barbeque sauce. Topped with the Duck's famous coleslaw. Served on onion roll. Is your mouth watering yet?

There's a lil something for everyone on this menu; from your true carnivores to your dedicated vegetarians. 

Aside from the amazing food the ambiance is just awesome. You can either take a seat out on the patio (which you pass by on your way in) or you can sit anywhere theres a table and chair inside. My fave spot, is back by the wine cellar and beers. Yes! that's right if you'd like you can purchase a bottle of your liking to go or have the bartender there open it for you to enjoy with your lunch. 

They also have a great lil store area to pick from herbal teas, to handmade cards and organic rices. Great place overall and I just can't wait to introduce someone to it so they can enjoy it as much as I have."}
{"text":"Nice place to catch up with your girlfriends over glasses (and more glasses) of wine. Patio Platter on the Patio...must I say more?"}
{"text":"The D&D has a great selection of sandwhiches... unless you're a veg... and then the selection is pretty limited.... although admittedly, I have never asked for the apple and brie sandwich WITHOUT the turkey to see if they will make it for me.  I bet it would be good.  I make a mean brie and pear panini at home.  

The veggie sandwich is pretty good.   

The place is pretty good for escaping a bad day.  You can sit upstairs with your sandwich and a book and sip iced tea until you're ready to go out and face the world again.  I also went on a pretty reasonable date there once.  We sat outside on the upper porch and talked until the place was closing."}
{"text":"Awesome place right around the corner from our layover hotel in downtown PHX. Thank you for my yummy snack!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Duck & Decanter. Their sandwiches are always fresh and delicious. I especially like that you can build your own sandwich. I usually go for a turkey, bacon, and avocado sandwich on wheat bread. Can you say yum?! The bacon especially, since it is huge and thick - I'm pretty sure it's prosciutto, 'cause this ain't no regular bacon. I always order this sandwich and my husband always wants a bite or half the sandwich. (He usually orders the Genova sandwich.) It's definitely a sandwich you could share, but only grudgingly. 

The store itself is really nice to browse and find specialty chocolates or treats while you wait for your sandwich. I'm always tempted to buy the fancy chocolate bars - there's too many to choose from! It's nice that they carry local product and other items.

There's plenty of room to sit, whether it's upstairs or outside on the patio. The patio is fantastic, especially when there's live music. We love coming here on the weekend to sit back and relax. 

If you love sandwiches, you should definitely stop by Duck & Decanter. This is one of the best sandwich places in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch eating outside when the weather is nice. Great food and friendly staff. Great local location."}
{"text":"The salads and sandwiches here are very good, but this review tipped the review from a 3-star to a 4-star when the cashier specifically asked how to spell my name when taking my order.  Very cool.  

I like the variety of lunch options available here, and also a fan of turning any sandwich into a salad.  My coworkers and I always go here when travelling to Phoenix on business."}
{"text":"Duck and Decanter has been my favorite since I was a little girl, and my moms when she was younger!

Their sandwiches are the best, so fresh with wonderful ingredients! They have gluten free bread, which is awesome for those of us with Celiac!

They have AMAZING tea and coffee selections too!

The tuna is the best, I think :)"}
{"text":"I got the full size Genoa sandwich. It tasted good, the bread was nice, and it was reasonably filling. However, the spinach seemed like the packaged kind you get in the grocery store, so it didn't feel like a \"fresh\" sandwich. I would probably come back for lunch, but I wasn't blown away."}
{"text":"I have such mixed flippie floppie feelings for D&D. I absolutely LOVE the selection of loose teas (black currant is number one good). The market area has a ton of neat little knickknacks, condiments, snacks and other goodies. Almost every sandwich I've had has been tasty. One complaint though is that they got rid of the maple glazed ham. That was the best, lean ham, and the replacement is just not satisfying. The staff is always helpful and friendly, especially with newbies that aren't familiar with the Nooner. I agree with the others that it is pricey. $7 for a sammich and $2 for a bag of Kettle chips? Cha-ching!"}
{"text":"Recently went to a happy hour with some former co-workers at D&D.  I was the first to arrive and waited at the tables outside for my party to arrive.  After a couple were there, we went inside to get some beverages and went upstairs for a table.  The beverage selection was good, I was drinking beer, and while they didn't have anything on tap that I was interested in that night, there were several in their selection of bottles.  Some more of our group arrived, and a cheese tray was ordered, and it was decided that we were going to go sit outside, b/c they were starting up the heaters.  We got a table right under a heater, not too far from three dudes playing music.  I probably would have rather stayed inside, if only because of the music...I'm not against music per se, but I have trouble listening/focusing on conversation when music is being played.  Anywho, the funny part about this was that at one point, the band brought up some girl from the crowd who sang two songs with them.  For whatever reason, the conversation stopped on the patio.  Not sure if everybody knew her or what, but another guy and I just started talking...I mean, if we were talking during the band, why not talk during this girl's singing?  Hopefully we weren't too loud and didn't offend her.  Anywho, the cheese tray was good, but wish it had been labeled, because whoever brought out the tray did not do a good job at telling us what was what (I can't even remember if one of our group brought it out or an employee).  One other minor problem was that our heater went out (ran out of gas) but no one ever came over to restart it, and it got cold...  

Overall four stars.  Pretty good happy hour specials and a nice setting.  Bet this would be a pretty great place to go in the evenings when it's a tad warmer."}
{"text":"Duck and Decanter \"the Duck\" is freaking awesome!  I like the store like atmosphere and the friendly staff.  Aside from fabulous sandwiches and sides they have lots of other great stuff too.  They have unique dishes, gormet foods and sodas.  The Duck also have a large wine room and beer selection.  

They can get busy during lunch, but the staff are very friendly, and quick!

This is a great place to grab a handmade sandwitch and snoop threw the store while you wait!"}
{"text":"Two words- Smokey Forest."}
{"text":"Super cute and super local. Very affordable fresh sandwiches. The boyfriend and I both got the Genoa sandwhich. Really good.

They also have coffees, teas, pastries and other fresh local items. They have a little coffee shop area where you can get fresh brewed coffees. Definitely good for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I haven't tried any of the sandwhiches (what this place is known for), so 4 stars for now.

I decided to take a look at this place since the sign is one of the things I remembered always seeing along the 51 while growing up.  I thought it was some fancy-pants restaurant.  I told this to someone who worked there and he told me people often make that mistake, coming here dressed to the nines.  So glad to be wrong.

Went here with a friend to check out the \"Study loft\" in the pictures.  It's a pretty huge area, but I only found one plug so I'm not sure how long a study group could stay there with laptops.

Had a cheese platter with fruit, olives, crackers, and bread, but the preparer forgot my pickles.  Oh well.  Maybe next time.  We'll be back to try more cheeses, that's for sure.  So far, it's the only place I've run into that has Derby Sage.  Mmmm.

Also: Patio is dog friendly."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend this place for breakfast... Not bad but really nothing special and pretty overpriced. We ordered the full sized breakfast burritos with cheddar and black forest bacon. Bacon was chewy and tasted like it came out of a microwave and probably could've made something better at home. $21 for the burritos and 2 bottled waters. Seat yourself and pick up at the counter. Friendly service and clean but boring, bland ambiance. Nothing like the location at Town and Country. Try the breakfast club across the street."}
{"text":"Always polite workers & music. Perfect weather now days. Happy new year and great weekend. Cheers. 
Best cheese."}
{"text":"The food is really good and they have lots of options available for you to customize your order.  The prices are high compared to other sandwich shops which will deter me from visiting frequently. Overall it is a good experience, just plan on spending $10-15 for your sandwich and drink."}
{"text":"During my recent trip to Phoenix, without a doubt my favorite find was Duck and Decanter. I discovered them while searching for a breakfast option one morning. 

I actually had a hard time finding them at first. They're located by the parking garage in the SE corner of a plaza that is on the SE corner of E Camelback Rd and N 16th St. Overwhelming amount of directional abbreviations aside, if you manage to find this gem, you will not be disappointed.

I stopped here twice during my Phoenix visit. I had the breakfast burrito with egg, cheddar chz and black forest bacon for breakfast one morning. It was pretty good. Adding their salsa is really what increased the flavor and brought it up a notch. 

On another day, we stopped in for lunch and had the marinated roasted chicken sandwich on sourdough bread. This was a game changer. The fresh, delicious roasted chicken was so good. It tasted like something your mom would make for you if she really loved you. Yeah, that's right mom, I'm calling you out. This is the sandwich I needed growing up. Not bologna and processed cheese. We can still salvage this relationship. Balls in your court lady. 

The food here was great but they're also a specialty store. They have an assortment of greatness throughout. Barrels of coffee beans, containers of different teas, wine, cheeses, beer, different kinds of oils, all kinds of stuff. 

There's seating all over, including outside, but I chose the upstairs loft both times. It was relaxing and there are giant photos of AZ wildlife all around upstairs too... I like animals... and free WiFi. Yup, they have free Wifi. I love you D&D!!!

*In a hushed voice* -- Psst, Mom, I love you too. I was just trying to be a big man in front of my friends. Your sandwiches are great."}
{"text":"This place is great. A grocery, a beer/wine bar, and a great sandwich shop at a suprisingly reasonable price (the sandwich is reasonable that is). I had \"the banger\" today and IT. WAS. AWESOME. Decadent indeed!

This is a great place for an afternoon to hang out and drink and eat cheese and just waste the day away. And get fat. Really, really fat. 

And did I mention 7 bucks for that sandwich? Hell ya. Forget Acacia Cafe, this is my spot now, despite the fact that I have to drive an extra 10 minutes. D&D is the whole package. Check it out."}
{"text":"I'll start with the disclaimer that I REALLY like the people that work at this place which is downstairs from my work.  The food is always great quality and if you need a last minute \"gift,\" they have wine and many other goodies to make a  basket (which I have done).
The happy hour serves local beers and their house wine is only $3.00 which makes it irresistible for a bargain shopper like me (and it's good too).
Stop by and say hello to Ally, Pierce, Gloria and Dave - and rest of the gang.  People are not strangers there for long!"}
{"text":"Our weekly Empowerment meeting creates around lunch. It seems we are forever looking for a place that has good prices and a quiet place for us to brainstorm and raise our energy. We have stumbled upon Duck and Decanter. 
Finding this restaurant is only half the battle, the other is where the heck the front door is. I felt I was intruding on the outside patrons, only to realize I had to meander through, taking a glimpse at what they were devouring to get to the front door, an added bonus I suppose. 

Opening the front door to a happily buzzing place seemed like quite a treat. To your right is small wine area, to the left were barrels and stuff. A bit confusing, but basically it is like walking into a deli shop of olden days. I had no idea what I was doing. I stood in line and squinted at the barely visible menu of an array of deli meats, smoked meats, salads and more. Of course being gluten intolerant one can hope she has hit the conscious jackpot..but not today...I will just have the insides..no bun! But wait! I see smoked duck and wait..I can order the sandwich of my choice and have it made into a salad. Well that is a great compromise! 

Of course to know me is to know I am gunna ask a lot of questions, my main concern, does the smoked duck use nitrites, nitrates or any of those other nasty carcinogens. Rather shocked by the question, the gentleman serving me has no idea and had no intentions of looking. Damn! I was really hoping for the duck! 

I quickly go with plan B as I weigh nitrites or high fructose corn syrup and soybean oil..with that it was the tuna salad. 

You can not pay for your meal in advance as the idea is to meander the store..so I did. there were barrels of tea and coffee ready to be ground at your request. I was not impressed with the coffee grinder on the floor-ewwww. There was also an espresso area but it was not operational. 

There are gadgets to buy for your kitchen, and packaged condiments and foods that I presume they make fresh there. There are fountain drinks , bottled drinks, good assortment of water and non alcoholic beer, and loads of sugary add ons within tempting reach right at the cash register-brilliant! And there is not tempting this fort Knox (well the rice cripsy treats looked..nooo must...resist...

I get my food, pay and go up stairs. There are different levels and two places to sit outside, which makes this place even more interesting. 

I open my package and there right on top are two pieces of bread stuck to my tuna. I read the entry for the Entree salad and it said nothing about adding in the bread. I ordered the salad due to the fact I can not tolerate gluten. 

Too hungry to care, I peel off the bread and I dive into my food and I am shocked at how awful it is. What is that mushy stuff? I think it was water chestnuts in my tuna salad. Who puts water chestnuts, (if that was what it was) in their tuna salad? 

I was unimpressed with the fact that the tuna salad was put on a bed of spring lettuce (which is a thumbs up for this nutritionist), some sliced celery and string cheese. Cheese?!? Who eats cheese with their tuna? 

The tuna itself was extremely dry and too salty for my liking, and I had a tough time getting it down, and eventually I got so turned off I did not finish it. There was no dressing and no taste.  I ended up not eating the salad either. What a waste of  $10.00 including guilt tip! At least the company I was with was fantastic! 

Some restaurants ask you if you have been to their establishment before so that they can have the opportunity to give you the best experience possible. I truly believe this is something Duck and Decanter could adopt. Maybe I was supposed to order dressing, I have no idea. Since I had never been there before and did not know what I was doing. 

I did ask someone else about the ingredients and she took the time to look and confirmed my suspicions-sigh. 

I can't wait until there is a conscious shift to what we are putting in our bodies and those who are Celiac or gluten intolerant can eat without anxiety! 

Is this a place for those who are Celiac or gluten intolerant? 
NO there is not enough awareness of ingredients, and handling of food. 

Bathrooms? yes weird..outside of the building, but clean. 

Would I return? 
No but for the sake of my friends, which is way more important, I will and eat some where else first."}
{"text":"A former hidden gem. Used to be a hot lunch spot with great \"Nooner\" sandwiches. Still cute and lovely, but the roast beef sandwich had scarce roast beef and for $13.00, a sandwich, bag of chips and a fountain drink left me feeling a little taken advantage of.

It would still be a great sandwich if there was any roast beef on it...but without the little side of potato salad and a pickle I think it used to come with, and without any roast beef, it's way short of expectations and previous reputation."}
{"text":"This is a kinda neat little place in Phoenix for lunch.  It's in a tucked away corner of a strip mall.  It neighbors a furniture store and a couple of other places who very  explicitly do NOT want you parking in their store spots if you are visiting Duck & Decanter.  It's huge on the inside.  There is a little cheese section, a wine section, espresso bar with a large selection of loose teas, foodstuffs area, indoor & outdoor seating, an upstairs seating gallery, the deli...like whoah.  It's kind of like an old mercantile of days yore.  You order your sandwich and then have time to peruse the store.  They have lots of Haribo gummi snacks, including my favorite twin cherries.  There are many options for sandwiches.  I got a spicy pulled pork bbq sandwich with cole slaw inside, served in a onion-y kaiser roll.  At least I think it was supposed to be spicy.  It was good, the BBQ sauce was a little sweet for me.  The cole slaw didn't really have a \"bite\" to it, but did keep the bbq and sammie moist and stuff.  I got some seriously overpriced for the size macaroni salad, and it was some of the most mayonaissey mac salad I've had outside of Hawaiian mac salad.  You can take as many pickle spears as your heart desires.  They have a dessert case that looks delicious.  Can't really say that their customer service was stellar.  I initially walked around the store trying to figure out if I wanted to stay for a drink or whatever.  There were a lot of people working. Somebody followed me from section to section, but never bothered to ask if I needed help.  Just tailed me like a store security guard.  Maybe I looked particularly suspicious on this day...without even wearing my escaped convict prison jump suit.  Then when I opted to just get a sandwich, the staff just totally disappeared except for the sandwich maker, who had to finish up what she was doing to help me.  Kind of a weird vibe.  
So, would I go back?  Sure, one visit does not make a complete story.  Heat does crazy things to people and it was a CRAZY hot day.  Overall, the sandwich was good and prices were okay.  The shop is cool.  And I bet it's cool to actually hang out there."}
{"text":"Super cute cheese/sandwich shop with amazing patio area and great little shop selling large variety of cheeses/various kitchen needs/spices/mixes- really need to check it out to get the gist.  I really wanted to check out the wine/beer patio but was on my work lunch so next time!! I'll 100% be back!"}
{"text":"Super cute joint that mostly boasts delicious sandwiches and has a specialty coffee bar. I could see myself spending way too much money on tea varietals and other Knick nacks. I opted for the fiesta salad, and I'm so glad I did!! About $10- greens topped with tortilla chips, duck chili and cheese. You may have to look for the location though- it's tucked away behind a shopping center and diagonal from a medical building."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the whole city. The prices are a little high, but cute shop inside for creative gifts good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have loved the duck for years and always drove out of my way to go there. But it's been a while and today I just realized, I moved and am now super close! Now I can go all the time! They have free wifi that works fast! Coffee drinks I still need to try and lots to look at while waiting for my sandwich. What sandwich is my favorite? The Hot One! It has succulent shredded beef and horse radish. I give them 5 quacks! (Or stars). Love the Duck!"}
{"text":"IMPRESSIVE!

I have lived here 1.5 years and have never been to Duck and Decanter, but I will definitely be back.  I am a veggie so it is difficult to find sandwich shops that have decent variety, but the D & D has all my fav veggies: avocados (that are fresh and green, not brown), cucumbers, sprouts, etc.  The bread is super fresh and the restaurant is clean! 

The best part of the experience today was the energetic sandwich man taking our order--he suggested the best breads, spreads and put pine nuts on my sandwich, which was a nice twist!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch!  There is a cool market with wines and foods that are a true treat.  This place is old Phoenix but still hitting it out of the park for lunch.  I would love to come back off of the clock to have wine and access tot ehir menu off the cloce.  I look forward to my next trip back."}
{"text":"I could live on eating a sandwich everyday and never get bored.  Oh the sandwiches are so great here, there's so many choices for everyone.  I just don't like spending an arm and a leg for what I get.  Like I said the sandwiches are great, but I have to admit they are overpriced.  I have been to many, many, many deli's and can get something comprable for nearly half the price.
I still have been here many times and will come back.  I like the atmosphere here and makes me feel like I'm not in Phoenix.  I recommend this place, but be prepared to spend a little bit more than your used to for a sandwich."}
{"text":"Sitting on the patio with my wife and kids, sipping on some wine and enjoying a sandwich.  I'm reminded why I love the duck - excellent food, wine, and amazing hospitality.  This place is an Arizona landmark.  I hope my kids can bring their kids here some day."}
{"text":"Duck and Decanter is another favorite of mine. Where to start, I live off of the coffee, tea, cheese, and meat that I buy from here to take home. I come here for many occasions whether it's lunch to grab a sandwich and one of their magnificent sides, or to grab some items for home, or even to grab a meat and cheese plate for a special occasion. You choose, they make! The quality of food is what makes duck and decanter!!!"}
{"text":"I'm shocked I have yet to write a review on this place, as I drop by pretty regularly. D&D is hard to describe because although their bread and butter are the deli items, they offer so much more. As you can see they have a full gift shop filled with artisinal cheeses, kitchen knick knacks, and more. Some from local vendors, which is a big plus. They also offer a full coffee bar, with one of the biggest take home tea selections I've seen, and a beer and wine bar with lots of bottles to peruse. 

They are ideal if you want to grab a quick lunch, study in the quiet upstairs deck, host a meeting (I see this a lot), or just grab a glass of wine and watch some live music outside. Basically you can spend your whole day there.

Now on to the food. The salads are always great. The macaroni salad and the egg salad are a few of my faves. Today I had the Vermont Treat with Broccoli Cheddar Soup. The soup was dense and packed with Broccoli florets, but the sandwich left something to be desired. It was a little dry, I think it had too much spinach and not enough spread. I'm still giving this place four stars, despite the sandwich I had today as their food is consistently impressive."}
{"text":"I hoped to like Duck & Decanter food more than I actually do, but unfortunately I find myself ordering the same sandwich over and over again.  So now I only occasionally eat at one of the restaurants.

I like that you can order half sandwich and when you call for take out or delivery, your name is written on the bag.  This is great if you are ordering for a group of peops;   Each person gets their own lunch bag.  (No need to search through the bags and open containers to see what's what for who's who.)

Veggies are quite crisp at D&D.  I've never had to worry about dead lettuce or spotty avocados.  Having said that though, their red onions are always tasteless.  This is one of the key ingredients that I use to flavor a dish but even when I ask for extra onions my order is still tasteless. 

Delivery is $5.00.  Not terrible if several people are splitting the fee.  What is terrible, I think, is a particular time several co-workers and I ordered lunch and upon delivery we were handed one - yes one - free cookie.  Really?"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere to grab lunch with a friend. Plenty of seating outside, and a huge variety of funky sandwiches to try. 
This is not your average place to grab a bite to eat--highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I love the Duck! Best quality sandwich in town! Yeah they are a little expensive, but if it's good, I don't mind spending the money. Who wants cheap crap? No thank you!

I swung by on my way home the other day to grab some lunch for the boyfriend and I and I was a little worried about the parking situation.... but I was pleasantly surprised that there was no issue. Lunch in downtown had just wrapped up as it was about 2pm so it was fairly quiet. Pulled into a metered spot, that even had 45 minutes left on it from the last person, THANK YOU!

I recommend either the turkey with provolone on a butter croissant OR the pastrami with swiss on sour dough. Make sure to grab some pickles when you check out, they are the best!"}
{"text":"I must say I can't believe I have not yet written a review on The Duck yet. As literally one of my favorite places in town one would think it would be at the top of my to do list. Maybe it is my secret desire to keep it a secret, as best as I can, so that it does not turn into a zoo everyday and I can't get my yummy sammies. 

It is also extremely surprising to me that some have gone to lengths of posting a negative review of The Duck. It seems that in those cases they are wanting The Duck to be something it's clearly not; a mainstream-mass production-delivary running-squeeky clean-just-like-every-there kinda place. If that's what you are looking for then I would suggest going to AJ's, they might be a better fit for you.

Duck and Decanter has been around for longer than I have been around. They have won award after award for the best sandwich in town. I am surprised Kanye hasn't busted in on a subway commercial and told Jared that he would let him finish, but Duck and Decanter has the best stuff EVER! It has a homey feel, that makes you almost say (as Jeff L. put it) \"Am I still in Phoenix?\" 

They have daily soups and special sandwiches. Their cheese is out of this world, the best provolone I have ever had for sure. They slice all their meat in house and very thin, perfect! I would tell you what sammy is my favorite, but that list would go on way too long. Turkey on a croissant, bree with roasted red peppers and prosciutto, garlic chicken salad, BLT.... 

The Duck is the perfect spot to have lunch out on the patio on a sunny Saturday or Sunday. They have a musician playing music most of the time and sometimes even have cute little farmers markets and art fests. It is perfectly tucked back in the shopping center with Sports Authority shielding you from the hustle and bustle. There is a fun grass area for pets and children to run around on. They also have some great knickknack shopping available to pa-ruse while you wait for your food. They have all kinds of coffee, tea, dishware, cookware, marinades, candy, drinks, wind chimes, magnets, jewelry, specialty gifts, and so on and so on. You can also call ahead and reorder to avoid the sometimes very long line. 

Have fun!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm! I have sandwich dreams about the Duck! Best sandwich in town by far! 

I do with they would spread out their locations though, all three are centrally located. **Note to owner- please expand to north Scottsdale so I can be treated with your yummy sammies at lunch during the week! 

I live close to the one on Camelback, but on occasion when I am down town I will hit up the one on Central. This one is in a more business district so it is smaller and doesn't have the knick-knack stuff to paruse and buy like the original one does. Easy to get in and out and down the road. 

Best turkey and provolone in town, no doubt! They have been voted best sandwich shop and best cheese selection in town by the New Times more times than one can count. They have a different ice tea flavor everyday and I have yet to have one I don't like. 

Check them out and you will see what all the fuss is about I guarantee it!"}
{"text":"Finally after three years I manage to get to the Duck & Decanter in downtown Phoenix! I love the various teas they have to choose from every day. I like the Smoked Turkey on Ciabatta bread, done up the Duck Way, with sour cream & onion chips and a green tea of the day. The folks here are super nice. The location is within walking distance of the USAirways Center and Chase Field. If you work downtown, make this a frequent lunch stop!"}
{"text":"A colleague who used to live in Phoenix recommended Duck & Decanter to me. I'd seen the sign out by North 16th Street, but didn't know it was a restaurant/shop. I tried it and - wow - great sandwich! They are made to order and are customizable. I get the Smokey Forest with turkey instead of ham. While you're waiting for your order, grab a table out on the patio or browse the shop for local foods, jams, honeys, or spices as well as cookbooks and other tchotchkes. 

They close earlier than some other restaurants, so be sure to check the hours before you stop by."}
{"text":"What a fantastic and unique sandwich shop/deli! 

Duck and Decanter is a treat for all who enter. I hadn't been here in years, but the minute I entered I knew it was as good as ever. Once you enter you are immediately greeted with the smell of cheeses, fr ah breads, baked goods, and various coffee/treats that are for sale around the store. The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable about everything that they sell. You can choose a sandwich they have on the menu or create your own with just about any meat, cheese, bread, salad you can think of. We ordered the egg salad sandwich on an onion roll and a chicken salad sandwich with sprouts on dark rye...both were exceptional and as good as we remembered. Our order took about 7 minutes which flew by since there is so much to see and buy in the store, so we happily roamed around and explored all the goodies. 

One of my favorite things at Duck and Decanter is their huge selection of fancy meats and cheeses you can try and purchase. There were so many that I never even knew existed and t made me want to try them all! Next time I make a meat and cheese platter I will be purchasing it all here; the staff were so helpful and told me all of their favorites and recommendations. 

The atmosphere is rickety and warm; it's completely unique and makes you want to find the perfect spot to enjoy your meal and have some \"you\" time or meet a friend. It's a really cool environment that you can't find anywhere else. The prices are reasonable and actually probably cheaper than most other sandwich shops around. The quality of food is top notch and just about everything they make is delicious. 

Duck and Decanter is a fantastic place to grab a bite to eat in a one of a kind environment. If you like a great sandwich, friendly people, and cool nick knacks then check this place out!"}
{"text":"A \"nooner\", as far as the Urban Dictionary is concerned, is sex in the middle of the day.  This is also the term used by Duck & Decanter to describe their sandwiches (says so right on the bag).  Is this an implication that their food is as good as sex?

I have been here twice so far, and while I wouldn't equate their sandwiches with any kind of amorous activity, this is still and amazing place to order lunch.  It's one of the few places in the Phoenix Valley that's comparable to the hof braus that I used to go to as a kid in San Francisco.  This place is one where if it's lunchtime and I'm in the vicinity, eating there is a no-brainer.  I will literally look for reasons to come here.

If I see you with a bag saying \"A Nooner\" on it, it either means that you are about to have a delicious meal, or you've just had one.  Take your significant other here, and maybe you can have two Nooners together that day."}
{"text":"The best sandwiches I ever had are my Grandmas. Nothing compares a meal made with love. I'm always exploring the on going new trends of resturaunts in central phoenix but I didn't expect to be blown away buy this place.
I was craving something more scrumptious and light for lunch and nothing to fancy. I noticed this interesting name tucked behind a shopping complex and the first impressions were a little creepy.
 Tons of patio space and two separate entrances and only two people outside. I walked in and was greeted right away. When you walk in you will notice a coffee bar and a little quick grocery pick up for some of the finest cheeses, and home made goods.
 I ordered the chicken salad sandwich that comes and it was super delicious and huge. I crave that sandwich often now. Craving a home made sandwich for lunch, then this is the place you want to give your attention too!"}
{"text":"WOW, what a place, great vegetarian spot, small market spot, Why not five starts, I'm very conservatives how many I give away.  From the basics this place has all the fresh ingredients that your stomach will never forget.

I can't forget the nice wine menu here as well.  What a great place to go on the weekends and relax."}
{"text":"Finally got around to reviewing this place from a draft. Just like the sandwich, I didn't really enjoy finishing this one.

The hot one is one of the stranger sandwiches I've had. Brisket cooked in cinnamon, ginger, and spices was interesting with an Asian flair but had little else in the sandwich. It arrived with the bottom half of the bread soggy from juice and covered in a pile of melted cheese that didn't really complement the meat. Wish some veggies could have been paired with it to balance out the heavy cheese and meat. 

Potato salad was great but couldn't save the disappoint from a small $10 sandwich.

For a higher priced sandwich it was quite 1 dimensional and disappointing. Overall, a very meh Uber Eats experience that left much to be desired and for the price not worth it."}
{"text":"Holy delicious.

My husband and I met a few friends for a relaxing afternoon on a Saturday.  I have never been here, but one of us recommended the atmosphere.  I had the Vermont, which consists of ham, cheese spread, apples, spinach, and pine nuts.  I switched the bread from whole grain to sourdough.  I inhaled it!

The outdoor patio was beautiful and the beer/wine choices were flowing.  We had a lovely, sun-filled afternoon with a solo guitarist tinkering in the background.  The staff was friendly but efficient.

The wait was a bit long for sandwiches at a deli (about 20 minutes) but the wait was super worth it.  There is a shop to buy some sauces, coffees, teas, and other \"schtuff\".

So good.  Cannot wait to meet up again."}
{"text":"I don't understand the regular bustle and patio crowd here, except for maybe the wine.  I thought the sandwiches were just so so, unmemorable.
the tea as well."}
{"text":"The food is good, but I think the prices are too high for what you get.  Considering there are plenty of other places to go for good subs, salads and fruit platters that would be much cheaper, it's hard to choose Duck and Decanter over them.

However, I will go here when I don't have to pay.  Why not, right?"}
{"text":"Had \"the hot one\" sandwich today, paired with Italian salad & Zinfandel  simply exquisite! The brisket was super tasty & the onion bread was soft & full of flavor  

Their wine room/bar is great, I love going to this place to enjoy a good glass of wine + a great conversation. Their bar tender is so attentive and pays attention to detail, the patio is a cool area to relax & unwind with friends, live music is a plus !"}
{"text":"Adding my four stars to the Duck & D. I go for a \"Nooner\" whenever I remember this place. Made to order sandwiches on fresh breads with a crunchy pickle slice and small candy; nice wine selection with helpful wine staff. The Duck has sold gourmet coffee and teas, along with espresso, before it became hip. Great selection of local and gourmet mustards, salsas , sauces, and spice mixes, along with some nice cookware at reasonable prices.

The location is a bit hidden and the patios somewhat awkward. Parking is disappointing. But this is compared to the pre-freeway, Starbucks, etc. Duck & D that had a grassy lawn and large shade trees."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches.  Love that they sometimes have live music outside.  Love that it's called Duck and Decanter.  What the heck is that anyway :)

They also have the BEST horseradish in the world.  If you like hot, this is hot."}
{"text":"This location is not as fun inside as the Camelback one -- that one feels like an old house with old school candy and toys etc to play with while you wait...but they do make great sandwiches, sides (potato salad) & I just found out they serve breakfast all day...if they were a little closer to my building I'd definitely check that out.  Today I got a half Genoa sandwich (salami, spinach and yummy chive cream cheese) with a side of potato salad (has celery, peppers and is delish)"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! A timeless classic. Way better than that shit hole miracle mile.The food, the service, the charm it all comes together perfectly.  It doesn't matter if it's breakfast, a Nooner, or a lovely evening on the patio while you listen to live music, this place is great! Plus they have a great little store full of all kinds of treats!
Can't recommend it enough!"}
{"text":"I love D&D and have been coming here for years.  It's always my go-to place for a nice deli sandwich in the Camelback Corridor.  I frequently get the creamy herb chicken salad on croissant and it's delicious everytime.  My husband craves the D.A.M. Sandwich: Pork roast rubbed with southwestern spices, pulled and marinated in a jalapeño and onion barbeque sauce. Topped with the Duck's famous coleslaw. Served on onion roll.  Yep, it sounds delish right?  My daughter usually gets the fruit salad or the pb & j but last time she tried the Trail Blazer Sandwich: Cream cheese, apple slices, grated carrot and trail mix on cranberry walnut bread.  Sure, it's healthy but she only ate one bite!  Maybe a bit too healthy for my 8 year old, oh well.  I tried it and it was a bit too \"granola\" for me too.

Oh, and you can order with ease online and skip a bit of the wait - even during a busy lunch.

We also like the choice of beverages, chips and snacks but they are a bit pricey (some specialty bottled sodas or waters are almost $3!).  For the occassional picnic though it's a delightful treat!  Also, if you have a child, don't forget to sign up on their website for the kids club - the kids get to pick an item out of the Treasure Chest on each visit.  Just another cheap little trinket to step on late at night or get lost in the couch, but the kids love it!  Don't we all love a freebie?!?  Thanks D&D!!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places.The duck offers more than just delicious sandwiches; they offer excellent coffee, a more extensive tea selection than you'll see from other coffee-type shops, and PRIME space for *~you~* time. 

If you are looking for a place to nestle into, whether it be for a meeting, some hardcore studying, or even a board game, THIS IS YOUR PLACE. I've literally seen people playing board games in one of the nooks. This place has expansive space which allows customers to branch out across the two stories.  You'll see that it's almost treehouse-esque. There's wood everywhere and you walk up and down rickety stairs to get to the upstairs loft/patio. They have a lovely outdoor seating area and again, the space for focus and meetings is unparalleled. I typically spend about 5+ hours here when I come and I see the morning flow (pretty slow and tranquil) then I see the lunch rush. Sure, it gets busy, but I bring my headphones which gets me through that period of crowdedness. The staff doesn't hover around you or make you feel unwelcome when you spend a lot of time there, which I certainly appreciate. They are actually very friendly and helpful.

The place is quite old and could possibly use some updates (computer outlets, tables and chairs, etc). However, I kinda like the shabbiness of it. 

Prices are typical for lunch/coffee. The first time I tried this spot, my dirty chai was eh. It was luke-warm and just not very good. I'm glad I gave it another try because in my most recent 6 visits, I haven't had a bad experience! 

Highly recommend"}
{"text":"A pretty good deal, the turkey sandwich I got was huge, on homemade focaccia."}
{"text":"One of the places on my quintessential Phoenix list. My mom would take us here as kids for a special treat! Amazing sandwiches, wines and a lovely patio! This is one of my go to places for out of town friends!"}
{"text":"One of my earliest memories of Phoenix concerns waking up under the eucalyptus trees that used to cover most of what is now the business park and shopping center next to what I will call the \"new\" Duck. The old one was far larger and would have been about where the Starbucks is now. Of course, I'm talking about 1973 here, so I digress. . . .

Anyway, the current abbreviated Duck remains one of my favorite places to relax and hang out in Phoenix. Now I have a little one who enjoys running through the grass near the patio and socializing with the other youngsters that frequent the place. The bar features interesting wines by the bottle and glass. Most nights the by-the-glass happy hour special is something rather interesting, in contrast to the \"red\" or \"white' found in other joints. The interior of the small bar is dark like a cellar. In fact, you can find a variety of atmospheres in and out of the Duck.

And the sandwiches! Yes, try them all. Very, very good."}
{"text":"This is a deli and a superstore all in one... they have all kinds of unique gifts that will get you off the hook if you forgot someones b-day at work... grab a sandwich and salvage your friendship all in one spot.

*Don't let the name fool you -- this is not a posh, fine-dining eatery -- it is a lunch deli (though a very nice one).

I have met a couple of the owners, very sweet people. Free Wifi here too.

This is a really great sandwich, though the lunch line can be a little menacing (don't expect a quick meal)."}
{"text":"The BK Army had a meetup with our leader the lad we follow and the listen to every weeknight at 9pm on Channel 3. Oh wait, this suppose to be about the food, not Beverly Kidd. But she's so cute.

Ok to the food. Its been about about two years since I have been to the The Duck and I have to say I really need to come back sooner next time. My usual fare is a roast beef or corned beef sandwich, but this time I wen for the duck sandwich. I can't believe that I waited this long to try out the signature meal. 

You get to choose what you want, a variety of cheese is accompanied by different mustards, mayo and of course the tomatoes, lettuce, onions, and of course almost every type of bread. What is probably the most fascinating is the assembly process. There are always at least five people assembling the orders, three taking orders or getting the orders to the customer. 

You order at one end, wait around a but and pick up on the other end. On between there are cookies, sauces, coffee pots and almost anything one could want to have a yummy meal. Then there is the stuff for the home kitchen or counter. 

So to the review the duck sandwich was amazing, going to have it again. Got mine on a croissant with a bit of mayo and mustard. Only got a half, with a beer. There is a small pub style corner with a smaller choice of beers. This didn't damper the meal at all. 

The place is always hopigng seems like. Seating upstairs overlooks the lower area, and the outside always seems to have a couple of four legged companions that are sometimes as humorous as the owners. The little fellas seem to know exactly how much they can annoy their larger counterparts. 

This is one nice deli, sandwich shop and gathering of just plain great folks. Oh yeah and Beverly Kidd was great fun to be with and eat with.. she also seemed to like the Chocolate Surprise cake I got for her.... opppss was that suppose to be kept quite?"}
{"text":"Wow this is a really cool place.  Im not sure if the Duck would qualify more as a deli or a grocery, but its got a pretty wide selection of products.  Nice selection of beer and wine and  cheese.  The architecture of the building is pretty neat as well!
I stopped by here for the Local First event and it was really impressive!  There was a beer tasting going on on the patio of the bar and samples of cheese and tea provided for free."}
{"text":"This place has the best sandwiches. And they've been consistently great every time I have eaten here in the past 25 years."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome, perfect for a luncheon with friends. The iced coffee is good and so are their sandwiches."}
{"text":"4 stars only because I enjoy this place for a specific purpose.

I see a lot of p----ing and moaning reviews about the sandwiches, and in many respects I would agree.  It is overpriced, and they are just sandwiches.  You are also in the Camelback corridor and right on the brink of the biltmore area, so one should not be surprised about the prices.  That having been said, I typically do not go here specifically for the food.

As to why I am a fan, the wine selection and folks who work the wine room are fantastic.  In the spring and fall months this is a great place to go with a group and just enjoy some drinks on their patio."}
{"text":"Nice friendly somewhat trendy atmosphere. Clean. They offer many novelty and food \"deli\" items. You could wonder around for quite awhile and find something you would want to buy that you could not find anywhere else. Their sandwich selection is vast. I paid nearly $12 for The Duckling
Smoked breast of duck, smoked turkey, cream cheese, cranberry walnut relish & spicy spring mix on walnut raisin country bread.      The meat was sparse.  (2 thin slices).    The sandwich was large. The bread was fresh and had that home made flavor you look for. The flavor of the sandwich was fabulous.   They had about 5 ice tea selections. All very good. The place is pretty cool and their are many options."}
{"text":"Veggie Sandwich = Vegetarian heaven!  SO fresh and I actually ate the entire sandwich and that is RARE!  Tea is fresh and I loved everything about this place!  one of my new favorites!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time yesterday for lunch. It was soooo good! There is a wine / beer bar adjacent to the main retail / deli area. Lots of unique gifts,  artisanal cheeses and more! I was amused that they take your lunch order on a brown bag and put your lunch in it. Had an excellent roast beef sandwich and sat out front (note for summer: they only have outdoor seating). Clean, friendly and delicious, check it out!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to find a sandwich shop that hits the spot and Duck & Decanter does just that! If you're looking for quality ingredients and sandwiches made with love, this is the place for you. As soon as I walked in, I was overwhelmed by the amount of fresh ingredients and specialty sandwiches. Their vibe is old school, like think a nice cozy pub during the Middle Ages with brighter lighting, and it's definitely different from other restaurants in Phoenix. I ordered their best seller, the Vermont Treat, famous for their cheddar cheese spread. As soon as I bit into it, I was in heaven! That spread is so delectable, I wish I could put it on every single sandwich I make. I've spent a few summers in Vermont, and its namesake lives up to the reminiscent fresh flavors that Vermont evokes. 
Some other pluses of D&D is their grocery selection, which has everything from jams and old fashioned sodas, to funny nut bags called \"Nut Sacks\". There's more than enough ample seating indoors and outdoors, and their happy hour specialties include $3 drafts and select sandwiches, too! The staff was friendly and chill, and I had a nice afternoon reading outdoors and eating my sandwich. I'll definitely be back to try more on their menu, especially the Nooner, which I heard was delicious!"}
{"text":"Seriously, why did NO ONE tell me about this place?  i had a random bread bowl craving (a la Perkins, which dont seem to exist here) and per yelp reviews, Duck and Decanter had them.  And sure enough they did!

This place totally surpassed all my expectations.  Employees are SUPER friendly, food is so good (spinach salad - yum, firey italian sandwich was amazing) and there is a little wine and beer bar tucked in the corner.

This place had me grinning ear to ear like a fool.  Makes me happy and i can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It's not that the sandwiches are particularly unusual or unique, but they are nicely sized with good ingredients on quality bread.  The patio is great this time of year and set back enough from Camelback so that you can actually have a peaceful retreat.  It can get busy at lunch, so I sometimes call my order ahead and it saves me time upon arrival."}
{"text":"I just ate here for the first time. I had the Lebanon and sauerkraut sandwich. I think it was the best sandwich I have had in years! WOW! Thank you Duck and Decanter.  I can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"I had the the chicken curry in a croissant. Very yummy. They also carry Grapefruit with Tupelo Honey candies in a tin, deelish!"}
{"text":"Super cute and cozy place tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the busy road of Camelback. The sandwiches are amazing and I loved that they sell so many locally made products. The live music added to the ambiance and they were even kid friendly with a treasure chest of freebie toys and sidewalk chalk. The staff was also so friendly. Thanks Karen and Allie! We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Hungry,  so am remembering yesterday's perfect D&D sandwich; veggie in a pita with champagne mustard.   Always love the staff, the food, the shop.  I have been going to the Duck since I was a kid and the next generation of the family is keeping it going beautifully!"}
{"text":"So as often as I go and as much as I enjoy this place I decided to update my review.  This is absolutely my favorite spot downtown for a sandwich.  Sure you can get Subway or Jimmy Johns for cheaper (not by much) but here you get QUALITY.  Their menu selections has something for just about anyone (they now started carrying gluten free bread) , sandwiches, soups, salads and pastries.  They also have a convenient online ordering system so you can place your order and pick up when you are ready.  

Their sandwiches are fresh made to order with exactly what you want.  Try one of their signature sandwiches, YUM! Or keep it simple...it's your choice. If you are not that hungry they offer a mini version of most sandwiches (using one slice of bread but super generous fillings)  I personally prefer to keep it simple, generally going for one of the following, ham sandwich on dark rye with everything, egg salad on dark rye (no cheese) with everything or peanut butter (house made) with honey on whole grain. 

They offer a variety of beverages including beer, wine and fresh brewed iced tea. You can feed your sweet tooth here with a variety of pastries or select candies they offer.  A happy hour is offered in the evenings, sometimes with live music.  

The service is quick , friendly and the ingredients fresh.  Crisp leaf lettuce and tomato on your sandwich are not treated as an afterthought here.  They take pride in their quality and presentation.  

Skip the big chains across the street and shop this local AZ business."}
{"text":"I don't get it. I really don't. I feel like I could be stoned to death in Phoenix for saying this but Duck & Decanter just is not that good. First of all, it's in a parking lot. Like, seriously by GNC, some fast food and a Sports Authority. Sexy? No! 

Once you get past the fact that they \"adorable patio\" as coined by others is in a parking lot, you hope the food blows you away. Well, it doesn't. I can make the same sandwiches are home. Honestly.. they're pretty standard. Way overpriced and the gift shop is so crammed with stuff it's overwhelming and annoying."}
{"text":"Small portions. Didn't even notice the duck on my Duckling sandwich. Over priced for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"We visited California and found this on Yelp. YUM! I love unique sandwiches, so I tried the Duckling. Both my 11 year old and I enjoyed it. They were very accommodating in letting us try several samples to insure my children would be happy with their choices.

They support local food and companies. This includes Smile Biscotti, a company created by a man with autism. I was so touched by this man's entrepreneurial spirit that I bought one! http://www.smilebiscotti.com/"}
{"text":"I am from Texas and actually visited my boyfriend in Arizona and he took me here for lunch. I was not sure what to expect because I have never been a big sandwich person, but this food was awesome.
Everytime I go back, I try a different hot sandwich and so far the Smokey Forest sandwich is my favorite. I think the name might have changed to something pretty similar...?
I have never really liked ham very much, but this sandwich is unbelievable. The smokey cheese they put on it absolutely makes it.
I recommend it to anybody.
They also have good fresh pastas you can get for sides and cake and pie slices for desert."}
{"text":"Been going to Duck for 25 years, talk about consistent, always friendly, helpful, patient, I  love it all. And then there's those killer sandwiches; Albacore, TWT  (the whole thing).
Try it, you'll love it."}
{"text":"you know that feeling of wanting to try something new and not wanting to settle for good-but-typical restaurants when you're visiting an area? This place does the job for a good price.

for it being a specialty sandwich shop (i.e. serving duck), it has reasonable prices (~$8.75) for their signature The Duckling sandwich, which is a like a thanksgiving sandwich with roasted duck breast (Turkey + roasted duck breast + cranberry and walnut relish + cream cheese).  MIND BLOWN. their bread is so soft. its like having pillowfuls of flavor in your mouth.

fresh ingredients, so good.

My friend had the Brieciutto sandwich (prosciutto, brie, sun-dried tomatoes + champagne mustard) the salty from the prosciutto (which, btw, was of excellent quality; not the waxy, can't-chew-through kind of prosciutto) and the sweet from the tomatoes and brie makes it pretty darn good.

they also have so many gourmet snacks, bakery items and sweets on the counter, for the after lunch sweet tooth craving to seal it deal. but what I thought was the winner was their selection of bite-size gourmet cheesees (~$1.50 each) for you to sample with your lunch. I got 3: the Marble, triple creme blue, and the Prima Donna Gouda. if you care, here's the verdict: the marble was surprisingly the most pungent of all. triple creme was the winner, it being creamy and just the right amount of oomph. prima donna gouda was meh. fancy cheese without the price tag commitment? oh yes pls. 

p.s. why is it so hard to spell prosciutto correctly?"}
{"text":"Duck & Decanter is an adorable wine bar-deli-gift shop (complete with espresso bar!) that's been high on my list of places to visit. I'm so glad I finally ventured in. It's adorable!  

With copious amounts of places to sit (inside and out) it's perfect for a leisurely bite. My adventure was during a Friday happy hour. (M-F, 5-7pm. $3 drafts! $3 house wine!) Arriving early to secure an outdoor patio spot we meandered thru the space. There's live music on Fridays with a start time of ~ 6pm. 

THE BASICS
Cooking accessories, teas, coffees, spices, a wide array of imported specialty foods line the shelves. Need some meat? They've got it. Want a sweet? Yep. In the mood for a sandwich? Si. Want some cheese? Be adventurous! They have adorable tiny wedges for a buck and change. \"Try something new without fear of commitment.\" Ha!

The wine / bar area, though petite in size, is lined floor to ceiling with wine bottles. Bob, the bartender on Fridays, is the friendliest gentlemen you could ever meet. The beer fridge is filled with a respectable number of bottles. 

SEATING
There's plenty of it. Two floors. My visit we were focused on nabbing seating outside near the live music. Turns out the music is fairly loud and you don't need to sit that close! You order your food inside and service your own tables here.

For noshing we nibbled on a patio cheese tray. I'm not entirely sure what cheese was served. Our platter included a small palmful of soft cheese, a jam spread, sliced bread and sliced apple. For the price point I'd actually have preferred a sandwich. But still tasty!

WINE TASTINGS
At Duck & Decanter you can arrange a private wine & beer tasting for groups of 14-24 ppl. Lasting two hours in duration the sessions include the booze (duh!), cheese, printed info and a host. Sometimes they can include additional food. It depends on headcount and budget. ($20-$35 /person + gratuity + tax). This seems like a really neat thing to set up.

Tasting menu examples...The Beer Tasting has you traveling thru six different countries. The Business Mixer offers three red and three white wines. The Blind Tasting sounds awesome! Wine is served from a brown bag and it's up to guests to pick the grape. 

So anyway, Duck & Decanter is a pretty neat experience! On the Friday I went, the outdoor space was very family friendly and multi-generational. If you're in the neighborhood check it out!"}
{"text":"A bit on the pricey side but still one of my favortie sandwich shops in Phoenix.  I am not giving 5 stars b/c I sometimes feel ripped off but I continue to go to Duck & Decanter.  

2 words: PATIO PLATTER

The Patio Platter is like heaven in front of your face, you get to pick a meat and cheese assortment with crackers and bread.  I swear if I am the only person in there, it takes 30 minutes to get the platter and if there are 50 people in there, it takes 30 minutes to get the platter--- I suppose consistency is good.  It's worth the wait (and weight) -- it so delicious!

The little shop inside is fun to pick up a few interesting gifts, it's overpriced but sometimes they have 20% off sales on everything in the shop that isn't edible.... 

The Duck will forever be a place I like to enjoy sitting outside with either an iced tea or a glass of wine with friends n  family and nosh on some yummy food."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch. Ordered the Duckling and was promptly served. Cost was decent, about 9 dollars for a filling sandwich. I loved the cranberry sauce and cream cheese-the contrast between the two was definitely the best part of the sandwich! There is also a little shop in the store with interesting knick knacks and goods. Complimentary pickles and salt water taffy were awesome and a nice touch. Definitely recommend for lunch, and you can't go wrong with the Ducking."}
{"text":"If you're a Downtowner who yearns for a handcrafted sandwich featuring high-end meats and cheeses on a variety of fresh-made breads, you can do a whole lot worse than this tried and true Downtown Phoenix lunch spot.

I usually stick with the roast beef and swiss with sprouts and mustard on sourdough bread but the specialty sammies are also good (the Vermont, for instance, is legit). The interior is spacious to handle the lunchtime crowds and you get a nice view of the hustle and bustle on Washington Street. 

Service-wise D&D is adequate. I'd prefer a few more smiles but the counter folks are busting their humps getting the sack lunches out on time so I can understand that opportunity for idle chit-chat is in short supply.

It's hard to get out of there for less than $10 if you get chips and a drink, which puts in in the mid-range for Downtown lunch values. It's local, so I don't mind paying a buck or two more.

Definitely recommend this joint for anyone craving a tasty sandwich made with care."}
{"text":"I like Heather P's review.  Holy deliciousness indeed.

I ordered the genoa from here last week.  I started out a bit crabby because several employees walked by me without acknowleding that I was standing in front of the \"order here\" sign.  But any annoyance immediately disappeared upon my first bite of my sandwich.  They were out of their normal bread so they offered me ciabatta.  I would never order it different, the bread, cream cheese and meat was a perfect combination.  It just might be on my top 10 sandwiches of all time list.

Their patio was pretty crowded since apparently they have live music quite often, so I ended up eating upstairs.  It was actually much cooler upstairs than downstairs so I highly recommend it on hot days."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are good and the people are friendly.  I like that they are open until 7pm, while most of the sandwich shops close much earlier.  The prices are kind of steep for what the sandwiches are so I marked a star down. 

I had the d.a.m. Sandwich and the flavors are good.  The coleslaw tastes fresh!  My husband had the bangers sandwich.  It was 9 bucks.  

I like that they have the pickles in individual baggies so the lunchtime crowd can just grab and go. 

Also, they sell cookies and sweet treats.  So that's good."}
{"text":"Born and raised in Phoenix, I can not believe I had never visited The Duck until I moved back to the Valley last year!

This is a great spot to grab a bite, meet with friends, have a drink or listen to a little live music when the weather is nice. I am a big fan of the avocado sandwich on sourdough, while my husband loves the Smokey Forest (with butter, no mayo!)

I love the wide selection of nifty kitchen gadgets, imported treats and gift ideas I find in the little shop. You can't go wrong with the Duck, I always enjoy myself there and have a great meal for a great price!"}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are delicious.  I like the Camelback location much better as it offers meat and cheese plates in addition to their sandwiches.  The Central location is very fast paced.  Order ahead if at all possible.  This is a little on the pricey side, but the ingredients are very high quality."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places now!  Excellent albacore tuna and a wonderful selection of wine. Could offer high end wines at a more appealing price and may sell more"}
{"text":"The duck sandwich was not bad. Maybe a little over priced."}
{"text":"I work close so I stopped in and ordered a chicken curry wrap to go. I got back to my office, started to eat it, and found out it was hairy. Not just one lone hair tangled in the chicken salad, but many, many hairs. I threw it out, and called to let them know their chicken curry is tainted. They offered to make me another one. No thanks. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Great sandwhiches, best in the valley...but prices are still too high!  Yet, I come back...been going here for 12 years now."}
{"text":"I was a fan of this place 10 years ago and moved out of state. I recently moved back and was excited to take my partner and out of town guests to this eatery!  It was awful, long wait, skimpy sandwich, loud music on patio, so loud and somewhat abrasive when the singer talked to the audience. I couldn't hear or talk to the person sitting right next to me.   This was the 29th and a Sunday brunch.  Disappointed, will not go back, especially since there are so many new and fantastic eateries in Phoenix!  You can't rely on a name, Duck and Decanter, your poor service, etc will catch up and you will not survive.  My advice to all who ask,  where is a good place to eat, I will say not Duck and Decanter!"}
{"text":"I got a turkey and cheese sammi and soup. It was amazing. I'll for sure be going back to have more :)"}
{"text":"Okay spot for lunch.  The salads are pretty good.  A little pricey for what you get.  I wouldn't drive here to eat lunch, but if you work within walking distance it is a reasonable alternative."}
{"text":"I had their chef salad with the house mustard poppy seed. For the money, it was a really good salad and I enjoyed their different varieties of tea. I do think it seemed a bit wasteful to give everyone a brown paper sack to hold their food, even if you were dining in. I might ask them to skip that if possible next time and save a tree! I'll definitely be back to try more stuff soon!"}
