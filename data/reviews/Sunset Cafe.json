{"text":"This place has always been pretty consistent.  We eat breakfast here at least once every time we visit Las Vegas.  I had the three cheese omelet and it was cooked perfectly.  There were 5 of us and everyone's meal came out hot and error free.  Rainy was our waitress and she was very attentive and friendly.  I would recommend."}
{"text":"Not very busy and now i know why. Although service and staff are super nice and accommodating, the food is not good. Ordered the loaded nachos, chicken quesadilla and cup of tomato soup with dinner rolls. The nachos were dry and the cheese was the canned cheese that you find at a roller rink. The beans on the nachos were sparse and the diced chicken looked and tasted like it was left overs from two days ago. The chips were just okay. The tomato soup looked like they had blended onions or something in it as it had a grainy look. The rolls were rock hard on the bottom and in middle i had to eat around it. The chicken quesadilla had no flavor with big chunks of chicken. The guacamole sat out too long and had dried over. I do not recommend eating here."}
{"text":"avoid!! manager jack was rude, service was slooooowwwww, food boring & cold! do your self a favor go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Welcome to hipster village. No biggie there really but it was funny to walk in and see such a stereotypical scene.  The only reason why I'm reviewing is because I'm pissed I paid $4 for a hard and cold shitty cinnamon bun. Won't be ordering that again and if I can keep you from wasting your money too then   The coffee wasn't as good as it was the last time I was here either. Step your game up or drop those prices. I could see if it was a big cinnamon bun but the thing looked like a hockey puck. Resembled one in texture too"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are regulars at the sunset cafe. We always request the waitress Daune. She is amazing and knows our order and has it put in as soon as we sit down. Not to mention the food is remarkable and you can't beat the late night specials!!"}
{"text":"I just love this place. The vibe is wonderful. Awesome down to earth clientele  And the staff is as real as it gets. I love the food & The coffee is delicious. Every member of the staff is friendly and personable.  This place reminds me of a lil coffee shop in Portland Or.  I now no longer go to Starbucks.  Sunset Cafe showed me what a real coffe spot is supposed to be! Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Ate dinner here instead of buffet. Cannot eat all you can eat anymore so decided to be served from menu in this cafe. I had rib roast, tasty, but tough and very raw for medium rare. Other had the fish and chips and cup of minestrone soup. Fish were freshly fried and soup had zesty tomato taste. These were also good. This cafe was very convenient since we stayed in this hotel. Low cost for dinner since only $40 tip & tax for two of us at this writing. Free parking in casino lot. Server was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Service was good. Today I had the buffalo chicken salad. Great choice for a wedge salad with good portion and great varied tastes with the blue cheese and ranch. Prices are reasonable. Good lunch spot and can get breakfast anytime is great."}
{"text":"They have done a total make-over on this place. I came here a few years ago the food was so-so but now they have a new menu and the food is great!  The BBQ ribs are delicious and you get a whole rack for $12.99 - enough for 2 people, or dinner and lunch the next day!   Pretty much everything on the menu is good, my favorites would have to be any of the pasta dishes, they have awesome french fries, and their side salads are great - probably the best tasting ranch dressing in awhile. I love coming here!  They also have a great breakfast selection I have yet to try...but those S more's pancakes look like the business, I will have to come back soon! =)"}
{"text":"Up all night partying; I decided to go shoe shopping at Zappos in Henderson.  I still was mildly drunk from the previous nights escapades.  This left me more agreeable than usual; for when asked where I would like to try and find something to eat at 10 am in this strange end of town I wasn't too bossy.  I simply stared back at my cohort from behind my oversized sunglassed and muttered something like \"I'dunt cur.\"    This is how I ended up in a restaurant full of people that looked like they were going coffin shopping after lunch....               @  @ @           @  ^O-O-   @           @       U      @              @   ---    @                    \     /              ~~  (   )  ~~            /         \ /            \            l    l           I   \    \           /    /            \    I    \         /     /(             )   I    I        mm   l          l     mm        I     l   lIIIIIIIIIIl     I    I        l~~l--l--------l----I---I                     I     l   l    I     l      I    I        I ```I   l    I     l      I```I        I     l   I_  I _ l      I    I        h    l    V    V       h   I             (O)                     (O) Which would have been okay if our waitress wasn't some sort of fire breathing menopausal demoness.  She slammed down my bowl of beef barley soup so hard I thought the bowl was going to break in half.  I asked for extra mushrooms on my sandwich so I got no mushrooms.  We sat with empty drinks for a while during our meal.  It sucked.  Hard."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here and I love that they are 24 hours. We have stayed here multiple times and I like the ease of just coming downstairs and eating in the caf√©. The location is huge and they even have another set of booths in the very back for overflow. When we go in, we have never had to wait to be seated. I like that you pay your bill with the cashier, because it cuts down on waiting for your server to come back and take your money/card and back again to bring your change or receipt for signature.   The food is good. We usually only go for breakfast, but I have had their hot wings and they're really good. They have a small menu with specials, which has breakfast, lunch and dinner options. The prices are really good considering the amount of food that you get.    The service is consistently good, especially today with Karrie. She was so attentive, so helpful, and very professional. She quickly took our order and our food arrived, maybe 20 minutes later. She filled all of our cups with coffee and left a full carafe on the table, so we could fill it as often as we liked. She also left extra cream for us and she consistently checked our carafe to see if we needed another. She is very personable and sincere, an excellent conversationalist and clearly shows concern and humility in her behavior. I can totally see her being a manager one day.  This restaurant runs really well and employees seem to know what they're doing. They are well-staffed at all the times that I've been there and I've met a few of the managers here, as they were covering for management of that bullshit Mexican restaurant, Cabo next door. Clearly they know what they're doing, as far as training their employees and making sure that they meet expectations."}
