{"text":"I have tried this take out on different occasion under new ownership and still does not come up to my standard of fish and chips , the main problem with to me as well is the cleanliness , of the place I know its been there for Ã  long time but still nothing to do with keeping the place clean ,has for the food i find there is too much batter not enough fish , and there chips too soggy"}
{"text":"Have to agree with the other's on this ...
Came here once ...haven't gone back .
Too much badder on the fish , which might be a good
Thing on this occasion ...why ? You ask ! 
Well the Oil looked super Dirty ...so all that badder protected my poor Fish from sucking in all that nasty flavor which it still did regardless...anyways ....if your in this plaza for any reason other than using the 
TD bank or food basics or the Bakery and you get hungry ......then eat at the bakery but read my review on the bakery first lol.... anyway .....
To end this it's simple
It be nice to have a great fish and chips place in the plaza / Area ..All they need to do is freshen up the fish 
Clean the place and fryers and take some pride ."}
