{"text":"Such a nice place! Brought my girlfriend there for dinner, we both enjoyed everything about the place! From the decor to the food/drinks/ service!  Would and definitely WILL go back again!   KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!  PS: I EVEN PUT AN OLIVE IN MY MOUTH AND SWALLOWED IT! lol"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been hit and miss for the last 4 years or so - mostly miss.  I usually order the chicken bifteki on a PITA and a small chicken souvlaki dinner.  The chicken souvlaki dinner has been consistent for the most part, it tastes good, and can feed two people.  The chicken bifteki tastes good when it's properly cooked but I've had burnt chicken one too many times over the past 4 years. In addition to overcooking the meat, they've recently been struggling with understanding what a chicken bifteki on a \"pita\" means vs. a \"bun\". The bun option is a hotdog bun that basically over powers the chicken and dries up the tzatziki which feels like you're just eating bread.  I've made three separate orders over the last 3 months and I've always clearly stated I wanted a pita, the gentleman on the phone always goes \"ya ya on a pita ok\" and I end up getting a bun. Not sure if it's their cooks or an incorrect entry in to the computer but it's really annoying.  When this happened again during the most recent visit, I called back and told them the order was incorrect again. Usually I get an apology and offered free biftekis (an offer I've never taken them up on) but this time...there was no apology.  I think I'm done with this place, I'd rather make the extra 15 min drive out to the Danforth.  PS. For what it's worth, if I was to review this restaurant in 2008/09 I would rate the food/customer service as 4/5 stars."}
{"text":"I currently work for a TV show being filmed not too far from Arkadia. I was introduced to the food by my bff who had ordered it before for a 2nd meal. The food arrived one evening and I could not honestly believe how good it was.  From the spanakopita down to the moussaka (or reverse) this place has some of the best food regardless of which culture it might have come from. We have had it again at work a few times (including once for large number catering) and the Arkadia standard has never disappointed. Not even a little.  Yes, the location leaves something to be desired. But if your looking for good, authentic (it's family run and they take pride) Greek or simply well seasoned, well cooked grub, then I would encourage you to check them out if you're in the area. The decor inside is fairly traditional and somewhat elegant. It seems, again, quite the juxtaposition to the Scarborough surroundings but I WOULD drive from the St. Clair West area out there if my significant other was in the mood for Greek.  When you get there, and if you can, speak with Joanne. I think she's the owner's daughter and she's fantastic. I can't wait until the next time I get to sample the goods at The Arkadia House."}
{"text":"Had a good flavorful dinner.. however.... had a little disappointment with 1) Ordered a Ribeye steak medium rare : my steak came out 1/2 portion well done and 1/2 portion medium well....   2) my husband ordered a mix grill dinner special on their menu...that was supposed to have a lamb chop... however, it looks like the meaty part of his lamb chop was sliced off.. it looks like he had a piece of small lamb rib instead....    a On the positive side.... tiramisu was good... the saganaki was good with the warm butters bread..."}
{"text":"Simply the worst service ever!!! Buyer beware! Food is adequate and the waiters are all rude!"}
{"text":"Used to work at Scotia right beside and it was lunch option #1 then but I still go back whenever I need me some #Greek. Best place in Scar no doubt, possibly in all of TO too"}
{"text":"I have ordered from Arkadia quite a bit, sometimes huge orders feeding 50+ people.   When the food is good, its really good.  Frequenty they slip up and mess up your order, or totally forget things.  I think the place has changed hands in the past year.  But overall..  the food quality is still there and tasty.  There is a lot of food on your plate, bread, the best greek salad, potatoes and rice and whatever you ordered. ."}
{"text":"Love It!!  You have to try it.  Arkadia is so much better than Mr Greek.  We are so happy we tried it.  We had suffered through 2 meals at this location when it was clair de lune.  It was our loss because we stayed away not wanting to get burnt again. Food is fresh and homemade.  Take out is so affordable.  Seriously try it!"}
{"text":"This was our 3rd time here in the past 4 months and we were not disappointed.  I had the chicken souvlaki which comes with a Greek salad which is a bit heavy on the dressing but still good.  Over the 3 times we had the bass, leg of lamb.  friends had the calamari, salmon, seafood pasta special and everyone enjoyed their food and the service.    Recommend"}
{"text":"My husband and I were excited to find a Greek restaurant that serves the filo-wrapped lamb and chicken (the Exohiko dishes). Hubbie ordered the lamb, and I went for the moussaka.  The experience started out so-so.  The waiter did not ask us if we wanted any drinks. We would have ordered some if he had asked. All the waiters there look to have worked there for 50 years. Complementary garlic bread was OK - while it had real garlic on it, the bread seemed stale or had been sitting out too long. Complementary pickles and olives were OK too. I enjoyed the salad, which as others have mentioned was rather large and it was a bit different than the traditional Greek salad. We ordered a soup for our son, it was beef noodles. This was disappointing as it was very salty and tasted as if out of a can.  My moussaka was the biggest disappointment. The top layer of potato was springy like a sponge cake. The whole thing was too dry.  I could not tasted the bechamel sauce. My hubbie said it tasted like it was in the freezer for a week.  The lamb was OK but not memorable at all.  The waiter never came back to check on our meal.  When the server finally came back to see if we were done, I complained about the moussake being the worst I've ever had and told him what was wrong with it. In a thick accent he asked, you want the boss?  I said no, whatever, it doesn't matter.   Because after all, we had already decided we were never coming back. The cheque came and there was no discount for my complaining either.   Yup, never coming back.  If the service was even just a smidgen better, we would consider going back."}
{"text":"The food is average at best. The included pickles and garlic bread are great. The grumpy old waiters are plain nasty. The steaks are tough and not worth ordering."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Arkadia House for years.  There aren't a lot of Greek places north of the Danforth, but this place is pretty fantastic.  The prices are great for the amount of food you get, and quality is quite good.  I will say that there have been days I've gotten less than great food, but I've been coming somewhat regularly for years, and it's only happened a couple times.  The souvlaki is fantastic.  Personally, I prefer to get the take-out version.  You get potatoes with the take-out version (the eat-in comes with steamed veggies), which I really like.  I also find that the waiters aren't very friendly or helpful, and it can be very, very loud and crowded on busy days (which seem to be random).  The owner/manager is quite lovely though.  Overall, you really can't go wrong with takeout from them.  For $12, tax included, you can get a big plate of food.  Yum."}
{"text":"Yesterday, my parents and I decided to go to this restaurant for Greek food. This is not in the Danforth...in fact, the location is somewhat random. We went here because it was close to my parents' work, an area of East York that is both industrial and residential all at the same time. The restaurant is located on Eglinton St. E near Warden so it can be easily missed, however, if you are ever in this area for shopping, movies, banking (RBC right beside) (there is a huge Cineplex complex beside as well as a mall nearby with The Bay, Shoppers Drug Mart, Coles bookstore, etc...) than you should stop by Arkadia if you feel like Greek.  Intro. We have always come here on a weekday night and despite people being there, it is quite empty. The place is fairly large. There is an indoor area as well as an \"outdoor\" area that is more like a solarium. May I suggest that you try the solarium area - it can get quite stuffy but you can open the windows. My parents and I always love sitting out here because it is bright, airy, and sunny and we usually are the ONLY ones out there.  Food. Good. If you don't feel like making the trek to the Danforth or you do not want the headache of trying to find parking in that area, I think this place is as good as it gets. Now, keep in mind I wouldn't come out here just to eat at this place, but if you're around East York, then go for it. We all had the Barley Soup for appetizers which is surprisingly very good. Then, for main courses, my mom had the pork Souvlaki (she always has this dish and she says it is very good. Now pork can usually be done dry, but I believe because she always orders it here, it has to be good). I had the fresh fish selection of sea bass and my dad had the snapper. FYI! The snapper was very large and my dad, who normally orders tons of dishes, could not finish it. If you feel like fish, but not too much of it, then order the sea bass as it is much smaller. In terms of the menu, all the signature Greek dishes are available (various Souvlaki's, fresh fish, pasta and they also have a section of the menu dedicated to vegetarian dishes).  The dish comes with soup or salad and sides of vegetables and rice. Now, they used to have potatoes as a side, but yesterday, they did not. We did not ask why so we surmised it was either a cut back or potatoes were not in season (?)  On a very positive, positive note (considering the alcoholic I am), the wines here are VERY reasonably priced. Unlike many restaurants in the Danforth, I did not see any Greek wines on the menu. However, can I just say that I have never seen a Chateuneuf du Pape being sold at $60 before? (Normally these wines go for hundreds of dollars!) Another one of my fave is the Yellow Label from Australia which goes for $40 here (I have only ever had it at another restaurant in Toronto for $48).  Ambiance. Nothing modern, nothing classy. Waiters are all elderly gentlemen but efficient and kind. We have never had bad service and considering we were the only ones out in the solarium, our waiter always came out to check on us. This is not a very expensive restaurant so if you want to come with a bigger group, it can be done. All in all, this is a restaurant I know I will be back."}
{"text":"We went here for Mother's Day, not my choice, but the rest of the family picked it.  We had been there before and I hated it, but everyone claimed it had a new owner and the food was great now and as good as any place on the Danforth.  They lied.    The place looks just the same as last time I was there about 3 years ago and they had the same senior citizen waiters, although there were a couple of younger new ones.  To give them the benefit of the doubt, they were completely full and probably swamped.  We had a 7pm reservation and didn't get seated until probably 7:15 or so.  We got a complimentary plate of olives and dill pickle spears.  Still trying to figure out the pickles, as they used to put hummus on there.    We got no menus at all until I motioned to one of the waiters to bring them.  Shockingly, the lamb souvlaki was missing from the menu, with only pork, chicken, or beef as options.  So much for what I wanted to order!   Also, the prices were a lot higher than they had been.  It was $17.95 for pork souvlaki, $18.95 for chicken, and $19.95 for beef.    We got bread before the menus, and had eaten it all before anyone ever came to give us water. The bread was really good and we were really hungry. :-)  Finally they took our order and we got appetizers in about 10 minutes or so and salads came shortly after that.  The salads were probably the best part of the meal besides the bread, quite large and with lots of feta.   The appetizers were OK but not great and for the first time I can remember, there was calamari left over.  I don't eat it but I am guessing it wasn't very good since everyone else usually scarfs it down.  The entrees took forever, probably an hour after we had been seated, and were not worth the wait.  The pork souvlaki was quite disappointing, very dry and not very hot.  The rice, which was a complaint of mine in the past, was still plain, dry,  and tasteless.  The roasted potatoes you normally get were missing and instead they put steamed broccoli, cauliflower, and carrot.  I hate broccoli and cauliflower so didn't eat those.  They tzatziki sauce was in a tiny cup and while good was not enough for all the meat since it was so dry you really had to dunk it.  We ordered dessert and it was OK, same you would get from any restaurant that buys their deserts from somewhere else.  All in all, we were there for over 2 hours and nobody was very happy with their food.  I think the consensus was to go elsewhere next time, Mr. Greek was mentioned, instead of this tired old place.  I gave them 2 stars only because they were so busy, had it been a normal night and we got the same food and service, I would have only given 1 star."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a friend on a week night when it was pretty dead. She frequents this place because she works near by and it was my first time at this restaurant. I ordered the gyro dinner and she got the souvlaki dinner. We were served a basket of warm, toasted, and buttered bread at our table as well as black olives and pickle wedges. Our greek salads came first and the serving was more than a side salad and tasted really good. Then the rest of our meals came. Mine came with veggies and potatoes while hers came with rice and veggies. We were pretty filled up from the bread and salad so we both ate half and took the rest home. Overall, I would come back as it is better than Mr. Greek and more convenient than going to the Danforth for a Greek food fixing."}
{"text":"Nice decor.  Service was not great.  We came here because of the vegetarian options available.  The appetizers were good.  The main courses were terrible.  We had the Vegetarian Mousaka and the Vegetarian exohicko.  The mousaka was bland and generic.  The exohicko was bland, gross, undercooked, unedible.  It was a main course of vegetables with sides of - 2 more vegetables.  Everything was undercooked and underseasoned. Thank god for the wine."}
{"text":"My mom and I went to this restaurant for my birthday.  We were absolutely blown away by everything, from the look of the restaurant to the service, the prices and the food.    To start, after we were seated the waiter brought a basket of garlic bread and a dish of olives and pickles.  I've never had complimentary pickles and olives before and it was a nice surprise.  I would say there were about 8 slices of pickles and 20 olives.  The bread was fresh and delicious.  We could have just eaten it and still been happy!  I ordered the veggie souvlaki with fries and steamed veggies.  I was so happy that the veggies weren't done in typical Greek fashion, usually they are overcooked and in a thin tomato sauce.  The veggies consisted of cauliflower, broccoli and carrots.  I am vegetarian and last time I was there they said the potatoes and rice were cooked in chicken broth so even though they are listed as vegetarian meals, make sure you double check this before ordering.  I had a small amount of tzatziki sauce with mine.  My mom had spanakopita, spinach and cheese in phyllo pastry.  It also had a bit of melted cheese on top.  She had rice and steamed veggies with hers.    Between the bread/olives/pickles our salads arrived.  They were very big and very tasty.    I had a glass of house red wine and we took home 2 galatobouriko desserts.  We were so impressed with this restaurant!  I have a group function to plan for early December and this is where we'll be going.  This is also our new go to place for special occasions."}
{"text":"I've heard this place is usually good, but unfortunately I was there on Greek Easter, and as with most restaurants on special occasions, you either sink or rise. This place was severely understaffed and/or the staff who were working had no idea how to handle the high volume of customers.   We were forced into a prix fixe for our large group. Because this meant they knew what we'd be eating ahead of time, I felt like they phoned in the rest of the service - we had to ask multiple times if we could please order alcohol (\"pop is included,\" they responded the first million times); some of the people around me asked for sauce and even though they were told \"sure\" just never received it. Food was pretty awful--salad was shredded lettuce, drowning in sauce with one olive---no onions or cucumber or anything. Bread with dips were round white rolls, not pita. Bathrooms were gross and total cost for two for lunch came to $130! What a rip off"}
{"text":"Will definitely be back.  Nice classy romantic place.  Food was delicious and beautiful presentation, generous portion sizes,  garlic bread and pickles with olives served as your waiting.  Grilled octopus appetizer was delicious if you like seafood. Hope that helps & bon appétit"}
{"text":"Came here randomly for lunch. Nice place ordered lunch special and was very happy with what I got"}
{"text":"4 of us went for dinner last week while visiting Toronto. My in-laws said they go here about once a month. It's nice/upscale inside.   To start we had a very nice basket of bread and ordered drinks. They had a couple of craft beers on the menu: I had an Upper Canada Dark Ale ($5) that was pretty good. Wife & sister in law had white wine.   For appetizers we had saganaki which was excellent and also some very meaty dolmades. Not much rice inside the grape leaves - mostly meat - so they were filling but very good. Appetizers were around $8-$10.  Dinner entrees came with a large salad.  For dinner my wife had a chicken and potato dish ($19) and I had salmon ($24) with a massive portion of traditional greens (rapini/broccoli rabe). The salmon was cooked nicely and a nice size piece. Service was decent. I think the bill came to about $170."}
{"text":"Came here with family for dinner after the place we originally wanted to go was packed. The family we came with has some dietary restrictions so we wanted to peak at the menu before being seated to avoid any unnecessary disruptions of other diners. My biggest issue was with the staff/service. When we asked to see a menu at the hostess stand the man gave us an exasperated look like he had better things to do (not like there was a line of people behind us). It took us less than 10 seconds to decide we'd dine with them. Upon being seated our waiter took our order and brought us bread but was annoyed when we asked questions about the menu. Eventually, after brining out our food, he disappeared and we had to call attention to another waiter to assist us. He did so happily and was the only saving grace of the experience.   The food, basic/mediocre at best. Nothing amazing about it. I wish I had taken pictures of our actual entrees."}
{"text":"I have gone here twice with family and friends on visits to Toronto, both times were similar experiences. It's a big restaurant and pretty quiet, the place reminds me a bit of a ballroom. It seems like a place people might have wedding receptions at.  The waiters came to our table within minutes of us sitting down. While attentive, I had the impression that they didn't want to be there, and just wanted to get things done and over with.  Anyways, the food: dinner started with some garlic bread and a generous portion of Greek salad. Nothing special about the salad, I would say the bread was better. My sister ordered the hot appetizer plate for us (we were a group of 7), and that was just ok. There was some calamari and spanakopita, to what I remember. After the appetizers, I was already getting pretty full.  I have tried the spanakopita and the pork souvlaki as the main dish on separate occasions. Both dishes come served with some rice and vegetables. The spanakopita was good, the souvlaki and the vegetables were dry. Most of us at the table were unable to finish our meals, and ended up taking the rest to go.  For dessert I tried the baklava, which was good as well, probably the best part of the meal.   Not really authentic Greek food, but passable. I would go again if invited by my family, as they really seem to like it, but it's not a place I would go back to on my own decision."}
{"text":"Overpriced food and shady business tactics. Went to this place recently and the food was bland with no flavor or seasoning. After I paid I found out they charged me $13.95 for the platter when the menu price said $12.95. Service was sub par and the soft drinks were flat. I won't be going to place ever again."}
{"text":"Hmmm, I don't know where to start? Noticed this place driving by one day with a full parking lot. Checked yelp, and it sounded like it could be a hit and miss so the next time I ended up driving by decided to give it a try.... And   It was absolutely horrible, there are not even words to describe just how terrible this place is... Chicken that you can't cut or swallow, really??  It's just awful, no words. From start to finish it is awful! Inedible McDonalds Big Mac shredded lettuce salad to their rubber chicken souvlaki and then the waiter who gives you a basket of garlic bread, puts it on your table, then says \"oh no\" and takes it to a table on the other side of the restaurant.   Just stay away, don't even think about it!"}
{"text":"I was craving Greek food, so couple of us went here for an early dinner on a Sunday. It wasn't busy, but people were trickling in as we left.  The servers were not so friendly, but the food was good.  I had the spanakopita, and my friends had the shawarma, which they enjoyed.  The complimentary olives and bread (already buttered) was really good!"}
{"text":"We usually order Friday Lunch Take-out once a month or every 2 months.  We work close by so we walk over and pick it up.  We have been ordering from Arkadia for almost 4 years and whenever I call in to order, it's lickity split done with no hastle.  It is usually the older gentleman taking the call who has an accent.  Because it was Friday and busy, our big order would take 20 minutes but that was perfectly fine.  I order for myself the Gyro in a Pita ($4.95).  We head over after 20 minutes and I give him my credit card.  Nice and easy.  Our food was ready in 2-3 minutes after I cashed out.  The gentleman asks if all the orders are there to make sure and checking, everything was fine.  We head back and I rip open that Gyro bad boy.  Gyro in a Pita has tender slices of gyro (ground beef w/ a little bit of lamb flavour), fresh tomatoes, onions, Arkadia house tzatziki sauce wrapped in a grilled pita.  Delicious as always.  Sure, sometimes the tomatoes and onions are not as chopped into smaller pieces but hey, the food goes down the hatch the same way.  Use the chompers!  The Gyro meat itself and tzatziki sauce are my favourites.  The meat is totally tasty and sometimes a little crispy which I find delightful.  The sauce is thick and pasty yummy.  Danforth has the best tasting gyros in my opinion but for a close by Scarborough option, it is convenient and a treat.  Try it out if you are in the area.  At $4.95 I find that an amazing deal for a Greek pita sandwich.  The Chicken Bifteki in a Pita is a good choice too."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best. I have been many times for lunch because of its convenient location, and every time has been meh. The service is good and washrooms are clean.  Today I decided to try the vegetarian moussaka since the last time it looked okay. I ate half of it because I was hungry. Hours later, my stomach still hurts."}
{"text":"I went to check this place out despite the reviews. I ordered the calamari and souvlaki chicken.. The wait was forever and at first I thought it will be worth the wait but the food was actually terrible... The best thing was probably the garlic bread they served. I'm definitely not coming back again.."}
{"text":"Working in the building next to this place makes it super convenient!  I get the souvlaki dinners for take out all the time here.  Portions are very fair, and the prices worth it for the quality you're getting.  Haven't dined in before, but I love my takeout experience every time!  Best greek food restaurant I've ever been to."}
{"text":"This place was hellacrowded at lunch today. After my dining experience, I'm not sure why. Let's begin with the fact that the service is garbage. I asked if it would be possible to split my calamari order and have half fried and half grilled. I wanted to splurge but a whole plate of deep fried is a bit much. Well I was informed that that's like having a boyfriend and a husband at the same time. I can't have both. Okay??? Funny I guess? But so much for accommodating guests. Next, we weren't asked once if we were enjoying our meal though we did have to ask three times for more water before it finally happened. On the plus side, our food came pretty quickly, but our server couldn't remember what any of us ordered and gave us all the wrong meals. The buns that they give you are a big ole meh too. Don't bother. My calamari was tender, but absolutely flavorless. Guess they don't season it. And my veggies must have had MSG on them because sure enough, I had a reaction. We were not thanked by our waiter when we paid the bill either which left me really unimpressed.  Okay anyone can have a bad day, but my friend who comes here regularly said today was actually a more friendly service than normal. Wow. Just wow."}
{"text":"3.75 star? (Is that possible? ha!)  Arkadia House is located somewhere in the middle of nowhere. The owners are from Cyprus (according to moro mu) and the menu is quite authentic Greek food.   It's much more spacious than your average Greektown restaurant and a little more upscale. I thought the prices were quite reasonable - most mains around $15-$20 and included a huge starter Greek salad.   We were given a nice basket of garlic bread, a plate full of kalamata olives and pickles to get started.   My dinner was giant; I tried the grilled calamari (I can never resist!) and it came with 4 full pieces. It was grilled nicely and not overcooked/chewy. It was served with a portion of rice and grilled vegetables, nicer presentation and food quality than you normally get at places over on the Danforth.  Our server was quick and efficient, but given that we were the last ones dining at a late hour, this wasn't especially surprising."}
{"text":"A small treasure in Scarborough!   Who would have thought of this great Greek place in Scarborough??  When I think Greek Food ... I automatically think Danforth but will definitely return back to Arkadia. Their food was flavourful and AMAZING!  I love the pickles on the table!  The warm hot bread loaf also did me in. Service was good - it was quiet so we were one of 3 tables in the dining room.  We went really early for dinner. Started off with a bunch of appetizers - of course SAGANAKI!   We had a LAMB feast and ordered their daily special of roast lamb, the lamb stuffed in phyllo pastry and lamb souvlaki.  DELICIOUS!  All the dishes were cooked perfectly and loved the potatoes! We will be back to try more :)"}
{"text":"I have been coming here with my husband for years. The owner knows us quite well. Whenever he's here we get a warm welcome. I love the warmth and decor of the restaurant. The food is amazing. I love the salad and garlic bread. My husband loves the pickles lol. I always recommend this place to my friends and family."}
{"text":"I always try to say something positive in my reviews, so I'll start by complementing the decore and nice servers.   Sadly, it goes downhill from there. I have eaten here serveral times due to work functions, and every time the food has been bland and NOT GREEK!   From the Salad, to bread, to Souvlaki...even the watery Tzatziki sad imitations of Greek Food.   The service, while friendly is EXTREMLY slow, and if you ask to have seperate bills on a large group...they tally it at the table not even using a calculator.   3 people had the same meal and received 3 different prices lol.   I wish the owners would fix this place...start with the recipes please.  Slow service can be forgiven when the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"We recently went back and brought a friend from out of town.  Arkadia did not disappoint!  The place was busy due to a wedding party but the service did not suffer at all!  Our waiter was fast and impressive.  I did not know a person could balance plates like that!  The food was great as always!  We had wonderful garlic toast, olives and pickles to start.  The navy bean soup was lovely and comforting.  The soulvaki dinner was excellent as always.  My friends had the Captain's plate (a favourite with tender melt in your mouth seafood).  I am so glad that the quality has remained so high.  Thanks to them, our friend had a much needed lovely night out!"}
{"text":"After spending a good morning under the sunshine at the beach, my friends and I were craving for Greek food. A friend recommended The Arkadia House near Eglinton and Warden, so we decided to give it a try. I was quite surprised that there was such a fancy restaurant in the middle of a mostly industrial strip.   Once we settled down, complimentary garlic bread was served, along with a plate of pickles and olives. I was a little over-excited about the garlic bread and admittedly ate one too many pieces. They were so good that we asked for a refill of the basket!  All the entrees also come with a complimentary plate of Greek salad, which was big enough to fill me up for lunch! The salad was quite delicious, albeit a little on the heavy side with all that feta cheese. Seriously, I didn't need to eat my entree at all after the garlic bread and salad.  Amongst our group, we ordered many entrees:  Stuffed chicken breast ($18.95)- butterflied chicken breast rolled with spinach and feta, topped with light cream sauce. I tried a bite but wasn't really a big fan of this one.   Gyro ($14.95)- slices of lamb and beef. I really enjoyed the gryo, but it was difficult to distinguish between the lamb and beef slices (I don't eat lamb). The two pieces of beef that I tried were very flavourful. my friend couldn't finish even half of this and had to pack the rest home.  Beef souvlaki ($19.95)- definitely not as good as the gyro, as the meat was tougher. The portion was also less generous, not that there wasn't enough food to go around.   Chicken exohicko ($16.95)- fresh filet of chicken wrapped in filo pastry, stuffed with romano and feta cheese. This was also one of my favourite bites of the meal.   Mousaka- ($16.95) layers of pan-fried eggplant, potatoes and ground beef, topped with béchamel sauce. The potato component was really interesting, almost had an egg-light texture to it. Although I enjoyed it on the whole, I felt that there was too much meat and not enough eggplants.   My overall impression of this restaurants is that there is a lot of food. The food is generally tasty, and we were all stuffed to the brim! I wouldn't come back unless I was super hungry next time!"}
{"text":"Unfortunatly alot of the reviews were not correct ,had dinner there last night thinking it would be very good ,nthe food wasnt that good and the service even worse , the waiter was very snutty and the portions where very small . the parking lot is extrimly small so we had to park across the street . In the end the bill came to over $ 100 but I feel the meal was ok but only worth half of that . But I did try Lamb and Quall something I never had before . Not even asked for a refill on our pop even though you pay for at least two ."}
{"text":"One of the best Greek places in the city. Little pricey, amazing service, superior products. Wow are their seafood plates incredible....chicken ok, lamb unbelievable, beer and wine selection good; go for the broiled fish daily with garlic bitter and fresh oregano.....did I mention the seafood??"}
{"text":"Pretty decent food for the price. Arkadia is within walking distance of my workplace so it's a great lunch spot."}
{"text":"My family came by here today for lunch since my mom was craving a good grilled calamari. I had found this place on yelp recs for a Greek resto. We were promptly seated and complimentary bread basket came out soon after as we were deciding on our meals. The warm garlic bread came w an accompanying plate of kalamata olives and pickle slices which I found was nice.  We settled on the grilled calamari app, spanakotyropita app, large greek salad, lamb souvlaki dinner and captain's platter. We also got Mythos beer.  Food : Spanakotyropita was really good - 2pieces, lots of spinach with a thin layer of melted cheese and the phyllo exterior stayed properly crispy throughout the meal. Greek salad - Veggies were fresh and dressing was pretty good. Generous serving. Calamari was grilled okay, just slightly overcooked, but good grill flavor. Mom found it salty. Lamb souvlaki was deemed excellent by all at the table, flavor and texture-wise.  Captain's platter was a lil bit of everything! Small filets of three fish, 2 scallops, 2 grilled shrimp, served w steamed veggies and rice. The veggies and rice were quite boring. The fish were done alright, salmon was NOT overcooked and dry, which was a happy surprise, but it was quite small. Sadly, the shrimp were overcooked.  Overall the portions and food was really alright.  On to service: not sure if It's just his manner, but service was quite abrupt and altogether not attentive. After serving our meals he didn't once come by to ask about it and we never had waters refilled during our 45 min meal. He came by at the end to clear the table and ask for desserts/coffee. We passed."}
