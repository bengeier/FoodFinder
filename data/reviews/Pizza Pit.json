{"text":"I woud not call this pizza.  The sausage pizza tasted like breakfast sausage and cheese on bread.  No italian flavor at all."}
{"text":"The first time I went it was good, being from the mid west I'm always looking for a good taco or blt pizza.  The pizza pits crust was spot on but not the bit or taco, it was good but not the original that I'm used to, the reason for the 3 stars is the price! I ordered a large pizza, half blt. Half taco and two soft drinks and my bill was 48 bucks! Really how does that jive? The waitress thought it was high also and tried to help but only got it down to 43 bucks."}
{"text":"It is sad that this location only has one star. We order pizza from here about once a week and have never had any issues.  We've never ordered anything other than pizza, so I can't speak to the other two reviewers experience.  We haven't had any horrible issues before so if you want a pizza and you don't want to pay high prices you won't be making a horrible mistake by ordering from Pizza Pit.  So if you're on a budget like me, order. It has always come in a reasonable amount of time and our order has never been wrong."}
{"text":"Our family enjoyed Pizza Pit before the groupon hit even though the pizza was pretty bad (the signature sausage is disgusting) but we found other menu items we really liked, the pit bread and salads and wings.  We could usually get a table and the staff was nice.  However, they were not prepared for the groupon crowds and had NO organization with their wait list.  Five different employees would come to the podium - not talking to each other and we were skipped over several times.  I had enough and we left and had never been back."}
{"text":"Coming from Chicago I love this place!  Cory the manager and the staff were wonderful to our table of five; we sat outside on the patio overlooking the water.  The pizza was delicious hot and you can tell they use quality ingredients.   I live in the Dodson Ranch area and I am glad that the Pizza Pit is doing great!   If you want an enjoyable friendly pizzeria I suggest you stop and see Cory and his team. Five Stars in my book!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been coiming to Pizza Pit since it originally opened. The service and the food has gone downhill in the past 6 months. We were a party of 9 but there was only 2 other tables in the restaurant with patrons. Our service was slow at best,  We ordered pit bread which was served to us before we had silverware, plates or napkins. I actually walked over and got napkins for our table. The restaurant was not busy and there was no excuse for the service. The pizza is no longer Quad City pizza, it was dry and overcooked. The flavors are no longer there. I am sorry to provide this negative review but it is not what it started out to be which us Midwesterners are sorry  for."}
{"text":"The worst service and pizza. They delivered pizza with the wrong toppings. The pizza was also not done in the middle, but the crust was burned, and then cut off so you couldn't even pick up the pizza without all the topping falling off. I have heard nothing but complaints from everyone in town who has tried Pizza Pit in DeForest."}
{"text":"This might be the worst gyros we have ever had, and we eat an awful lot of gyros all over the country. We both got about two bites in and took the food back. The meat tasted like it had been in the freezer for about 18 months despite the staff's insistence that it was shaved fresh the day before. The tzaziki sauce tasted like it was made with sour cream instead of Greek yogurt as well so that was probably old too. On the bright side, the fries were fresh even though they were a little over salted and the server was very helpful when we asked for a refund."}
{"text":"Placed an order online and received a confirmation number.  Waited 30 minutes past my order delivery time.  When I called, I had to explain 3 different times to 3 different people that I still had not received my order.  Each time they just told me they were busy and put me on hold!  Now I know why I haven't ordered from there in many years.  Won't ever again either.  I don't even want to give them one star."}
{"text":"I'll be completely and totally honest when I say I don't like cardboard with pizza sauce and pepperoni. You might as well eat the 4$ you use to pay for pizza pit's \"Two Slice Tuesday\". I would rather eat ass than eat pizza pit again...."}
{"text":"A couple of years ago this was spot on Harris pizza style. After new ownership took over, quality fell off and service disappeared. Cutting corners kills business, quality fills seats! Used to remind me of home, now I can't bring myself to eat there."}
{"text":"Pizza Pit in Sun Prairie is our go-to place for inexpensive pizza, especially at lunch time.  Don't compare them to the expensive, gourmet place across the street -- but if you are looking for efficient service and a great value for the (low) price point, I strongly recommend The Pit.  They sell pizza by the slice over the lunch hour (maybe all day?  Not sure?) and that's a screaming deal.  They also offer gyros, which I've never tried.    Note that the owner is often there.  He's a gruff guy, but takes a lot of pride in his pizza.    Yes, this restaurant is locally owned and operated -- another reason to bring them your business.  p.s.  They deliver.  Remember to tip your driver!"}
{"text":"They have great wings and I love their Gyros!  A lot of menu items to choose from, not just pizza. Was told order would be done in 15 minutes and it was."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night at 9pm. There were two people in the whole place, so service was good. We ordered wings, the veggie pizza and an italian beef. Let me start with the wings, they were bland but crispy so I wasn't too upset at this point. The italian beef was just horrid. It was super salty, more than a sandwich with au jous sauce should be. My husband, who eats anything wouldn't even finish the sandwich or take it home in a doggie bag. The pizza tasted like it came from a microwave and after one measly slice I pushed it aside and asked for a doggie bag (because while it wasn't appetizing it was still edible). Was hoping to support a locally owned business.  I just overall did not like the food and wont be back."}
{"text":"Wish i could give this pizza pit Zero stars. It's been awhile since I have had as awful customer service as this. Ordered a pizza, called in after 1 hour, 20 minutes of no delivery. Funny thing is i received a notification saying my pizza was out for delivery, waited 30 minutes after to call and I'm thinking.....my pizza will be old and cold after sitting in a car for 30 minutes. Freaking upsetting. So when i call in the employee who answered said it would be another 30 minutes to send out another pizza! I live 2 miles away. Let me speak with the manager..... Manager says i was called 3 times, horseshit! No missed calls no voicemails. Manager says she will give me 5 dollars off, wow splendid, thanks for the overcooked cold, small \"large\" pizza. Oh and the same inadequate girl who messed up the delivery dropped it off finally 1.75 hours later, with not even a simple sorry bout that.  Boycott this location at all cost, what a joke!"}
{"text":"The pizza I loved as a kid ruined by poor customer service and false advertising. I joined the email group to get deals on one of my favorite childhood memories of pizza.  They send me emails saying buy one get one free on Monday and Tuesday, but it is buy one get 13 dollars off second pizza. Yes a good deal but not what I was told on line.  Don't promise what you can't deliver."}
{"text":"The food is decent. Worth trying if you like pizza a lot. Not my favorite, but it's okay. Give them a shot and you'll be enjoy it."}
{"text":"I ordered my food at 6:43pm and was told that it would be delivered in 45min.  after 1 1/2 hours, I called to see what was up and had barely even said my name before the manager interrupted me with all sorts of excuses as to why my delivery was late (driver no show, driver got pulled over for speeding etc) and wanted to give me a credit towards future deliveries.  I understand things happen, I just wanted to get a time when my food would be here.  the manager told me 5min at most.  the food did not show up until 8:15pm and by then it was cold.  the fries were horrible.  I won't be using the credit towards future business."}
{"text":"While I was napping, the Mr. took the opportunity to order some 'dinner' for us. I appreciate the thought, but I wish he'd lose this number. On the plus side, the driver was quick and friendly, but the pizza was even worse than before. The box was SOAKED in grease, the crust was wet and the toppings fell off. I do not want to eat this again......"}
{"text":"I don't know why you would spend 14$ on a pizza from this place when you can go to Albertson's, which is right across the street, and get a DiGiorno pizza for 4$ that tastes the exact same.  Plenty of better pizza places nearby, I suggest skipping this particular one."}
{"text":"Ordered from here, received a call 35 minutes later saying they don't deliver to my address and when asking why it took 35 minutes for them to figure that out they hung up on me. I called back to speak with the manager he said \"we don't deliver to you, what do I care\" and hung up as well. Quite a classy establishment!"}
{"text":"Went here w/ my girlfriend because we were in the area and we used to live right around the corner. This place used to be the worlds worst Italian restaurant. Pizza sounded good and we wanted to see how the place had changed. The restaurant looks totally different inside. It's very nice. They have some good beers on tap. The pizza was pretty good. It's pizza. Wings were good. The patio is nice.   There aren't a lot of good restaurants in this area. I don't think I'd go out of my way from Tempe to come here but if I still lived around here I'd come here all the time to get some beers and  a pizza and hang out. I wish this place was here when I lived here!"}
{"text":"I'm just thankful they were open late and delivered to our hotel. After 12 hours on the road I just wanted to relax. Large pizza and garlic bread $20. Could have done without the bread, it was just Italian bread from the supermarket oven baked until dried out, but the pizza was alright. Very basic. Pizza was warm, order was correct, on time, and I was starving."}
{"text":"I'm from the Quad Cities, and I grew up eating the original Harris pizza, which this is modeled after. This pizza hits the nail on the head, and transports me back to Illinois. Great pizza, restaurant is clean and they serve beer, and the staff is friendly. Best pizza in Mesa,  and maybe the state! Don't listen to people on here getting pepperoni, Quad city pizza is all about sausage, and I like mine with sausage and green peppers. :)"}
{"text":"There are four other options for pizza in Oregon and frankly I like Marias better but overall  Pizza Pit offers more reliable delivery, a lot of menu selections, and when you dine in the restaurant is always clean."}
{"text":"Orders get messed up.  I pay different prices for the SAME pizza.  Somethings going wrong there.  The pizza is still really good, when you get what you ordered."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here months ago at lunchtime since he had a coupon. The food was good, but the service (even though there were only about 2 other tables in use) was exceptionally slow. Figured I'd order some takeout from there tonight and avoid the service. I ordered online. First, the website told me they couldn't deliver to me. I live just on the other side of the 60 on Dobson. Whatever. I change it to pick up. After placing my order, the website never told me when I could pick up my order. Ok. I figured I'd give them about a half an hour. I show up at the restaurant, and again there are less than 10 customers in the place. Nothing is marked as a pick up area, so I stand there a few steps inside the door. The waitress comes by, says hi, then proceeds to ignore me. I moved closer to the bar, looking at her, but she won't acknowledge my presence. After a few minutes, I give up and walk out. They didn't even call to see why I never picked up my order. This place has the absolute worst service I've ever encountered. I would never recommend anyone go there unless you see it on one of the undercover restaurant shows first, as maybe they'll get their act together then."}
{"text":"Good pizza we ordered cheese bread and a ham and cheese sandwich was delivered. Delivery took a lot longer then expected. The supposed \"cheese bread\" wasn't even good it was soggy and did not look appetizing"}
{"text":"no. no, its not the most amazing pizza in Arizona. for those of you on this fine review site that have said this, i would really like to smack you with a fat big mouthed bass. hard. that's not to say the pizza is disgusting either. it's just fine and thats it. its just fine.   i came in here with the bf looking to try something new. i noticed right away that this place definitely had the mark of inexperienced or first time owners. plenty of tvs but very light on the actual beer on tap. i did like the layout: high tops for just meeting with friends, the bar where you can stop in for a beer and a slice, and the nice seating area for when you want to sit down and enjoy a long evening with friends. staff was extremely friendly and they were very happy to have anyone walk through the door. all around a really nice atmosphere.  now for the food. as i mentioned above, the pizza was just alright. we got a simple pepperoni pizza (medium i think). it came out fresh and hot from the oven however after biting into it, i think it could have stayed in the oven for another 3 or 4 minutes. the crust was a little soggy but the sauce definitely packed a nice powerful flavor. i dug the sauce. as the pizza sat a bit more and cooked a little in its own heat, the crust got better. so yeah, a couple more minutes basking in the glow of the hot oven and it would have been better. still its not a pizza that id write home about.   this place definitely has potential. if it could get its act together with the bar (ie get a couple of more beers on tap other than hefeweizen and miller lite) i really think this could be the spot that my friends and i flock to when old chicago is taken over by douchers who want to watch the UFC fight. that outdoor patio is really calling my name, but i'm going to be patient with this place and see if it really does turn into a neighborhood joint i'd be proud to frequent."}
{"text":"We stopped in at 5pm to order a 12 inch pepporoni pizza. We were told about 10 minutes wait. I checked with the girl at the desk about the pizzas at least three times and was told 1 minute longer. They would then just disappear. Around 5:45 two other customers had been waiting for 20 minutes and asked about their orders when the girl working there walked back and realized our pizzas had been sitting there waiting for at least 10 minutes. Just unorganized and bad customer service for so called quick, good pizza. I would not waste my time again."}
{"text":"I do not understand the poor reviews. We order from here and have never been disappointed. I love that I can order online and get an email when it is sent out for delivery. The pizza is awesome and the pit stix are so good! Prices are spot on for what you get."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from out of town. I ordered a pizza for delivery. The customer service was great both on the phone and in person--the delivery person ...but the pizza was very sad!  I got pepperoni, black olives, and extra pizza. The pizza barely had any cheese on it. It was ok...I've had better, but I still wouldn't discount this place next time if I wanted any of the other food or pizza they had on there merely based off of the customer service I had. It would definitely be worth a second time.   I feel like you can always fix a product but it's harder to correct bad service."}
{"text":"The place was very clean, service was friendly and timely, I just didn't really like the pizza.  If you like the pizza you would like this place.  I feel bad for giving it a bad review, I really do.  Sausage was way too spicy, not much of a flavor except hot and didn't have enough cheese on it.  I'm sorry Pizza Pit, I wish I liked you!"}
{"text":"Gross! I ordered the pizza pocket appetizer it took 30 minutes and it was burnt! Servers are way to jumpy and they seem like that want you to leave as fast as possible.  She brought my check before my food even came out and the place was completely dead."}
{"text":"I went here with my mom because of a groupon she picked up. The place looked nice but the service was terrible even though they were slow. Sadly, the pizza was just awful though. I'm from New York so I know what pizza should be like and everything was wrong; the dough, the sauce, the cheese. It's like someone who never had real pizza looked up how to make a pizza on the Internet, went to the grocery store and this is what turned out. If you like california college student pizza creations, this place is worth trying. If you want real pizza, head down the street to Buono's."}
{"text":"Pizza pit the best pizza for the price. Never disappointed. Ingredients are fresh, crust is perfect hand tossed. They have wholewheat crust as an option. Their sauce is very good.  I can't say anything bad about this place!"}
{"text":"recently tried the pizza pit - not a fan of the meat pizza, but the dough was different and very good.  Also, LOVED that they brought out a kid size rolling pin and some dough for my daughter to \"help\" them."}
{"text":"The Pit nearest to me doesn't have mac-and-cheese pizza (at least not on the website), and I had a very serious craving. So, having heard of a change in management, I called the Deforest location. The guy on the phone had a few problems taking the order - he said they had a new computer system.   We headed right over and our pizza was done when we walked in the door. The same guy from the phone needed help when I paid (new computer, see above), but that was mostly just a hiccup.   We went home and ate our large mac-and-cheese pizza and enjoyed it. It was perfectly fine. Cooked right, correct toppings, cut into even slices."}
{"text":"I wanted pizza and my kids wanted macaroni and cheese, so I figured I'd head to the Pit. If only somebody had answered the phone! It was around 6pm on a Saturday night, which I understand is a busy time, but come on. I let it ring about 15 times and then hung up. I paced around my house for a few minutes, got distracted, then tried calling again about ten minutes later. Same deal: lots of ringing, no answering. I let it ring another 15 times or so and just gave up.   I don't mind having someone answer and then immediately put me on hold. It's a lot better than the nothing that I got. Thumbs DOWN."}
{"text":"We're new to the area, so we're trying as many new places as we can. We have a two year old, and decided to come here for lunch on a Monday. It was a casual atmosphere, perfect for a toddler, with friendly staff. My husband and I got a pizza, which came out pretty quickly, and was delicious. Our picky two year old gobbled up the French fries and chicken strips. I think we will definitely go back - it's always nice finding a place where we can bring the toddler without hassle (and have him eat!)."}
{"text":"The guys running this place are genuine. That's something I appreciate.  The pizza is good, it won't win any awards though. The daily lunch combo's are a great deal. Two slices and a can of pop for $4.75 or one slice and a can of pop for $3.00. You can get the card that gives you two free slices and pop when you have it filled out for 12 slices.   Good Prices Great Service  A+ in my book."}
{"text":"Grease running down my hand. That's a first. Maybe that's appealing to some people, but definitely not me.  Sorry, Pizza Pit staff.   [Cue the Tim & Eric \"Ya blew it!\" .gif.]"}
{"text":"I just wanted to speak out after reading some of the negative reviews about the pizza pit.  I'm sure that for some people this is not the type of pizza that they are used to and if you can't handle a little spice then you definitely will have some difficulty with the sausage.    I grew up in the Quad Cities and when I would go home to visit I would get 10 half baked sausage pizzas from the pizza place with the same recipe and freeze them and then transport them in dry ice (yes, haz-mat on the plane).  It was a ridiculously cumbersome process and not cheap either (especially since you have to pay now for your first checked bag!).  This is a home-town favorite.  It is anything but flavorless and bad.  I have been to MANY a bad pizza place in AZ and we had always said that we wished we could get our hometown pizza place here.  When I heard that pizza pit opened I nearly cried.  (I know, ridiculous right?) But all of my transplanted family members felt the same way!  Their pit bread great and their signature sauce, crust with a touch of sweet and sausage that has no match in Arizona.  We're not talking chunks of sausage but ground pork sausage covering the entire pizza.  The cheese is actually the farthest thing from fake that you can get!  There is a generous portion on the pizza and it adds an amazing texture to the whole pizza.    I only have one thing to say about the comment about the cheese not being melted.  I will say that there have been times if we have gone right when they open that I notice the normal overall appearance and browned bubbly texture is not always present.  I don't know if this is something to do with not heating up the pizza oven enough or what, but if the restaurant is reading this then I definitely think there are times when it could be a bit more done as far as the cheese texture goes.  And again, it is not this way every time.  So I would lean towards the fact that maybe the ovens need to be turned on earlier in the morning?  Overall, this has become a regular stomping ground and I love that they even do get togethers every 1st and 3rd Sunday of the month for Quad City transplants (apparently there are a lot of us!)  I have yet to make it out but I like the idea.  There truly is a cult following around this pizza and maybe if you have been and don't like it, just realize that to some of us it is truly the best pizza around."}
{"text":"Went here last night and were the only 2 customers. Started out by ordering the mozzarella cheese sticks which were nothing special, but good. We also ordered the chicken supreme pizza and were pleasantly surprised. This was delicious pizza. We were fine with getting the small pizza with the appetizer, but may have needed to get the next size up if we had only ordered pizza. The owner was the only worker and he was very nice.  I will be back to give their other pizzas a try. They have a large menu of speciality pizzas which all sounded interesting. Overall had a very good experience"}
{"text":"PP has been my favorite chain pizza since my days as a student at UW-Madison in the late 70s. However, the person answering phones and taking orders at around 6pm on Wednesday, December 9, 2015 just about put me off Pizza Pit forever. Incredibly rude, to the point I hung up on him. This person may be better suited to a non-customer service role. I do like the pizza though."}
{"text":"I was starving after a 5K and this was the only place open near my house so I came in with a hungry stomach and a not-so-clear mind from hunger.   The classic combo with cheese sandwich was decent. I had it with marinara sauce but there was nothing too amazing about the taste of it overall that makes me wanna go back eat it again (unless someone else wants to go).  Bf liked the roast beef & cheese sandwich with garlic sauce. Again, nothing too stellar but still tasty for him.  Not terrible, but not \"oh my god let's go RIGHT NOW.\"   Still, it satisfied that night!"}
{"text":"When I go out for pizza, I like to get something that I couldn't make at home. Something unique with lots of flavor. Pizza Pit does not disappoint. Not only do they have taco pizza that is delish, but the BLT is my new favorite. The owner is super nice, and they have a Pit Club with discounts including free pizza rewards. I can't wait to go back and try the other pizzas on their menu. So yummy!"}
{"text":"A million pizza places in the valley, and they are all nearly identical. Don't miss this lesser-known gem. The Quad-cities style pizza is absolutely top notch."}
{"text":"This place was just, okay. The patio was cool and it was a beautiful day to sit outside overlooking the water. They had a decent beer selection for the husband. We got calzones which were good sized but nothing amazing. The wings were great though. The food took quite awhile, and we were the only ones there, I can't imagine what it's like when it's busy. We'll probably come back again to enjoy the patio and give the pizza a chance."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Ordered a gyro with extra meat. Cost $10, was just the gyro...no fries.   It was a complete rip-off. If that had extra meat, I'd hate to see what a regular gyro looks like.  Tasted fine, but was totally not worth it."}
{"text":"Decent price for some pretty awesome cheesy pizza. Wings aren't the best, good side selections."}
{"text":"Good gyros and chicken strips. I prefer their versions of these to Parthenon and Glass Nickel, respectively. The gyro is enough for a meal but isn't gigantic and overly-salted; and the chicken strips are a good size. The honey mustard sauce they have actually has both honey AND mustard, whereas at some places it just tastes like mustard and isn't sweet at all. The fries are passable, but not great. I wouldn't get them again. My food has always arrived within the window of time they said, and I like that you can order online. The \"loyalty rewards\" program is actually pretty good if you order on a semi-regular basis. It's like a coffee punch card where your every tenth (or so) order is steeply discounted."}
{"text":"The food was decent.  The place is understaffed and everything took an hour.  The 2 people working on a Friday night did a wonderful job all things considering.   insane that on a busy Friday night only 1 pizza cook would be working.  The nice girl working the front had to handle the bar,  hostess table, wait the entire front and back. AND bus everything.  Who the hell owns or manages this place?"}
{"text":"Stood around for 10 mins while the man ignored us until he took our order , and saw one of the female workers  doing some kind of narcotics in the bathroom probably heroin ,For the love of god don't go here , felt gross just leaving that place and threw away the food"}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing here.  I highly recommend you try Pizza Pit.  I don't like sausage pizza, but their sausage is not your typical. I was told by the staff it was made with ground sirloin.  You should absolutely try the sausage pizza when you go.  If you want gourmet style pizza with great atmosphere, staff and drink specials you shouldn't pass this place up.    Ask to be seated outside.  You may not know, but they also have a great patio right on the lake."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza restaurant.  I only wish it were some sort of magical diet food that made me lose weight so I could come here all the time.  The crust is what makes it so great.  And their great combination of toppings.  My two favorites are the No Name Pie (a white pizza) and the BLT.  And as crazy as the BLT sounds (who puts mayo on a pizza?), I have to say it is amazing.  As one waiter put it: think of it as a sandwich where the crust is like an Artisian bread.  Perfectly worded.  I want to try the taco pizza but can never resist the BLT.  The service has always been great.  Friendly staff, even the cooks.  Good selection of beers and a great happy hour and daily drink specials.  I would definitely eat here more often if they delivered and their hours weren't so limited on weekdays (3pm - 9pm.)"}
{"text":"I order pizza from here almost every weekend and it's always on time. This pizza is always dank af and not to greasy."}
{"text":"Fresh yes but late delivery. When I call they say they are only 7 min late at that time but they won't be leaving for a while. So a response was we are not that late yet but we will be even later?"}
{"text":"Excellent! The menu looked so good we had to try a bunch of items. Pizza, Wings, Gyro, Fries, and Nuggets for the kids. All good! How can you not want to eat at a place with a signed John Jurkovich poster!"}
{"text":"We just started ordering from them now that we have moved to this side of town. Pleasant on the phone, good coupons and a fresh, fast product. Will frequent again!"}
{"text":"Let me just say that I really really wanted to like this place. The staff was extreamly friendly, the place looks really nice inside, but the pizza is awful. I mean really bad. It reminded me of my college days when we would eat those cheap Tostinos frozen pizzas. The cheese was super white, and was barely melted and not even the edges were brown. I almost thought that they had forgotten the sauce until I lifted up the fake cheese and saw a little touch of red on the crust that I assume was pizza sauce.  There was also an entire layer of unseasoned plain ground beef that covered the entire crust, this just tasted really odd. I also tasted something that reminded me of bad beef jerky with a fake smokey taste, I assume it was the pepperoni. We also had a order of wings and they were good, thank goodness since we would have starved otherwise."}
{"text":"Man, I love this pizza!!!!  It's the best in Phoenix in my opinion, and I'm part Italian and figure I know my pizza.  How can you say it isn't the best when it is?"}
{"text":"Don't confuse this Athens Gyros with the original Athens Gyros on State Street in Madison. These gyros SUCKED! Tsistakes sauce was bland, meat was tasteless, even the pita bread was bad. I could do better buying the Gyros kit at Woodman's !"}
{"text":"I had a Living Social coupon & though it was for a dine-in only, the management was good enough to let me do a take-out order. Thanks a ton for that! However, the food is below average in my  I ordered the Garlic Chicken Pizza, side of Mozzarella sticks & Tiramisu dessert to finish off things. I felt the taste was below average & everything was too bland.  FINAL VERDICT:The management was very friendly. Too bad the food wasn't that great - Would never go here again!"}
{"text":"Wished we would of liked it better. The staff was so nice and friendly. The place was clean and comfortable. There is a pond in the backs- Loved watching the ducks. It was our first time with \"sirloin sausage\" hated it. Probably not their fault. It's ground and you can't pluck it off the pizza so no one ate seconds so we had 1.5 pizza left. Took home and tossed.  Waste. The wings were good. Crispy and the ranch was good. - sports on tv- husband liked that :)"}
{"text":"Coming from the midwest, and the true home of this style pizza which is a copy of HARRIS PIZZA (often imitated never duplicated) but PP is a fine copy. But we went there today and saw the \"under new ownership\" sign, I will miss the guy with the motorhead license plate i think he was the owner. anyways, we put in an order immediately for some pit bread & drinks, my moms water had a floaty... me & my wifes 2nd round of rootbeer tasted weird so we asked her to take them back & give us dr. pepper, when she came back she said \"oh the reason it tasted funky was cuz the thing is almost empty\" (at this point a competent staff would change it) so we are waiting, waiting with empty glasses as she stays up at the bar with the bartender? chic & theres only like 4 customers up there, finally pizza #1 comes its good as usual although we suspect a change in sauce (a little worse) we think it was the same flavorless red stuff they served with the pit bread! so after a while she FINALLY gets back over to us, she says \"can i get u anything else?\" I say \"ya, our other pizza? do u know when thats gonna be done?\" she actually answers \"oh, i have no idea\" and to top it off my drink is empty again as usual, i say can i go back to root beer on this round? she looks at me weird, and Im like YEAH?? she says its still empty (in my head im saying well this is when u change it u fkn moron) but i just got dr. pepper again... she goes back, comes out, says printer cut off order blah blah basically they just threw the pizza in right then, cuz she was an idiot who doesnt pay attn to anything and would rather run around with her butt dimples showing that she has earrings in them, the other waitress was a child also dressed like a jr. hooters waitress. Its a shame that this place wont last."}
{"text":"This is my all-time favorite pizza place!! (Not specifically this location) but the entire chain. The four alarm pizza is not for the faint of heart! Jalapeños, Pepperjack cheese, spicy Italian sausage, and pepperoni! Would recommend for delivery or pickup. I have never dined-in at this location."}
{"text":"If you are typically a delivery person, you may be ok with this PP location. If you stop in to order or pick something up, you may change your mind. Floor and workspace looks like it has not been cleaned...ever. Looks run down like no one really takes pride in how the restaurant looks. As for the food.....not that great."}
{"text":"Not our best pizza experience in Madison.  We ordered two large regular crust (which turned out to be thin crust) pizzas; one supreme (or deluxe or combo, whatever they call it) and one half pepperoni/half pepperoni and sausage.  The pepperoni/pepperoni and sausage pizza was OK.  Toppings tasted good, though I wish there was more cheese.  It was also greasy.  As for the supreme, the first thing that I noticed was that the mushrooms they used were canned mushrooms.  I mean, seriously, Why?  Fresh mushrooms are easy to get all year round, so why get them canned?   Later on, I saw their available toppings list and they have both canned AND fresh mushrooms.  I mean, seriously, AGAIN?!  Why give the option?  Just put fresh mushrooms whenever mushrooms are requested (OK, one last time: mushrooms).  Moving on... the supreme was a little better than OK.  One big problem is that with so many toppings on this pizza, lots of grease, and with a thin, but non-cracker, and crust, the pizza just kinda goes... limp.  It was hard to eat without having the toppings fall off.  However, the pizza is actually pretty good the next day cold.  This was one of the better pizzas I've had leftover.  Strangely enough, I probably enjoyed this pizza the next day more than the day we bought it."}
{"text":"Went to the Pizza Pit this past weekend.  Maybe it was cause I was with a pretty large group, but I kept getting ignored.  Ordered my drink...never came.  Had to flag the waitress down to get it.  Wanted to order food - asked for a menu, but didn't get to order with the rest of the people at my table.  The people at my table even asked, were you not ordering?!  Was finally able to get the waitress' attention about 20 minutes later but only when she came by the grab my menu...asking if I was still needing it.  No, I'm not needing it, but would like to place my order please?!     I ordered the kids meal chicken tenders for Baby C and a side salad for myself.  Seemed like standard prepared from frozen tenders and fries.  I picked as much of the breading as I could off the tenders and let Baby C eat.      And again maybe it was because the place was crowded, but it was flippin HOT in there.  I noticed the A/C (which the thermostat was by the bathrooms) was set to 83 degrees.    By the time Baby C and I left (along with most of the party), we were covered in a sheen of sweat.    All in all, the service and food was lack-luster.  Maybe I should have ordered pizza since it is the Pizza Pit afterall.  The only thing that was prompt about my visit was the waitresses readiness to drop the check and run my credit card.    Meh."}
{"text":"After skimming to reviews and always driving by, my girlfriend and I decided to finally try this place out. The atmosphere is nice, it looked like the waitress had her kid following her around as she waited tables. Was not very busy at all which was unexpected.  In terms of the food, we tried the wings and they were good. I ordered a pepperoni pizza and my girlfriend ordered a calzone. After the wings we had high hopes about the main course but alas we were disappointed. Now I might call myself a pizza connisour..I have tried pizza all over the state and this pizza reminded me of frozen pizza. It was ok, nothing special or magnificent about it. My girlfriends calzone was the same, it looked like you coulda just bought it at the albertsons across the street.   To conclude with this review, the whole meal was expensive, totally not worth the price we paid. I'll gladly head across the street to Jimmy and joes and spend 5$ on very good pizza then this place."}
{"text":"You would probably have to be a flipping idiot to take the time to rate a small pizza franchise chain right?..thats me...i was born and lived the first 13 years of my life in madison and stoughton wisconsin and the first thing I want when I come back to visit is a pizza pit pepperoni pizza...the sauce is too good for words..it has a tangy kick that makes you eat so fast by the time you down the 8th slice you realize you may have overdone it...if you haven't had it and you try it and don't love it, then you may need to get the ole taste buds checked out."}
{"text":"Brak and I tried Pizza Pit for the first time tonight (thank you, Groupon). It's a hidden gem in a big field of pizza parlors in east Mesa.  We had to google Quad Cities-style pizza to figure out that we would get a medium crust (as thick as DiGiorno, only good) pizza with a spicy sauce. They seem to make their dough, sauce, and cheese from scratch, as well as their signature sausage, which we didn't try.  Our order was our standard \"pizza test\": half pepperoni and half Canadian Bacon/pineapple. Both sides were great. The tangy sauce and creamy cheese make this pizza really stand out. I was surprised that a crust as thick as theirs would be crisp all the way to the middle of the pizza, but it was perfect. Overall, a good pizza, worth a try if you've never had this style, and likely to be a part of our regular pizza rotation.  Tip: Order a smaller size than you typically do at a pizza place. You'll eat less pizza than normal (it's pretty substantial), and the smaller size will offset the higher-than-normal prices at Pizza Pit.  The staff was extremely friendly and attentive. The restaurant was clean, and the experience was great. Next time we'll sit on the patio overlooking the lake."}
{"text":"Wings are alright. The gyro is acceptable. The pizza is only slightly rubbery. Delivery however was speedy and service at the bowling alley was very nice and accomodating."}
{"text":"Had dinner at the pit last friday night with the Fam..    Kids loved playing with dough the entire time... great salad and pit bread.  Loved the sausage on our pizza too..  Even saved room for the dessert pizza which was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Wings didn't hit the mark for me. It was a small part of a huge order for a large group of people, but it was all I got for lunch so I was a bit disappointed. Guessing it was a lot to take on during an already busy lunch rush and my wings sat for a bit."}
{"text":"This place is great! I've never ordered a pizza from here yet, but I'd definitely be game to try it based on my experiences with the other items.  The gyro box is amazing and, for me, more than enough for two meals. I usually order it with curly fries; they just taste better for some reason. The box also comes with a huge side of tzatziki sauce. Nothing worse than getting a big meal and a tablespoon of sauce...this is never a problem here.  Delivery is fast and courteous and not once have I had any item go missing or a wrong order. I will definitely be ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for awhile, and I finally had the opportunity to do so tonight. This isn't your average pizza place - that's for sure. Pizza is a polarizing topic as it is, and most places are either New York style or Chicago style or Italian style or West Coast style (or some variation of these). This is Quad City pizza - something I've never had from a place I've never been. I'm told this is the only place you can get pizza like this in the Valley - I believe that. I don't think this style really makes its way outside of the Quad Cities.   Let me just say that there appear to be shenanigans going on with this restaurant's web page. Nearly 60 reviews hidden from view. Some may well be fake, but many are clearly legitimate. Also, many of them appear to be favorable. In case you were wondering, the hidden consensus tells a different story than the handful of reviews allowed to remain above the fog. If mine ends up in the trash, I'll KNOW something is up. Anyway - I will just state now that my review of this place is probably closer to a 4 than a 5 - and I'll tell you why, but I do feel this place earns a 5 on the merits of being different and because the shenanigans brought their score to a 3 which is just nonsense. There's no way this place is a 3.   So we ordered the pit bread, a caesar salad, a pizza with half of their famous sausage and half pepperoni, and I washed it down with beer. The pit bread is basically just their small/medium pizza crust with melted mozzarella cheese all basted with garlic butter and with a side of their pizza sauce to dip. The sauce was a mild and yet zesty marinara flavor with a hint of sweet. It was good. The pit bread was a solid cheese stick. If you like the flavor of Papa John's cheese bread (as I admit I do), but don't care for the chemical fake mass-produced-ness of it, then this is a solid choice (and a fair comparison) - it's also cut into strips the same exact way. It's also a hint of what's to come with the pizza, but you'll still be surprised.   The salad was interesting - the chicken was tender and juicy, but almost had the flavor of chicken soup chicken rather than grilled. I liked their dressing and croutons. Overall, it was good - just a little different. They offer the chicken crispy as well which I would like to try. As we were eating, they brought by a taco pizza which looked like a party. I asked how it was made and the description was something I had never heard of before - intriguing. Part of the draw of this place has to be their unique pies.   Now the pizza. The best way for me to describe it is to say that it's like a Chicago style deep dish, but on a thin New York crust - but even that's not doing it justice. It's different. The toppings are cooked under the cheese and they dust it with spices. Now the pepperoni side was great. I liked the flavor of everything about it. The sausage side was another story. Now, this is the polarizing factor. You can't go here expecting italian sausage - which is what pretty much every other place serves. I didn't expect that (but that's what I truly like), and that's not what I got.   Their sausage is made from Pork Sirloin - they make it in-house with tender loving care. You can't really find this elsewhere. Your mouth will want to relate it to something else it has tasted if you're eating it for the first time, but the comparisons you are drawing will be wrong. Now Pork Sirloin isn't the most flavorful of meats on its own, so they season it... lots. It's an interesting blend for sure. The first thing I noticed was that the sausage was a layer under the cheese of tiny tender sausage crumbles rather than big sausage rocks that you may be used to. It's a unique taste and texture.   Now out here in the South West, we've been exposed to some cheap frozen pizza brands that have a slightly similar texture of sausage crumbles, but just know that this is vastly different in terms of flavor and especially quality. Now I wasn't a huge fan of the sausage, but I think it's something I would definitely have to try a few times to get used to it. I know this place has some regulars who are addicted to it... those who grew up in the Quad Cities definitely.  The restaurant has a great location and even a nice patio overlooking a gorgeous grassy bank canal. If you go for dinner at sunset, it can be a lovely experience. The name of the place is puzzling - why not call it Quad City Pizza or something that echoes its roots... something that starts a discussion or begs questions. Pizza Pit sounds like a lesser more common joint. This is a unique family-owned restaurant people will drive across town to visit."}
{"text":"I don't get the bad reviews. We get great fresh pizza whenever we go bowline at the adjacent Dream Lanes. Even a choice of light sauce and lots of veggie options."}
{"text":"You know exactly what you're in for when you get the food: greasy, bowling alley indulgences. It's literally out of a bowling alley. It's delicious, if that's what you're looking for.  But the service. I can't stress how poor the service is. They've signed up for EatStreet, but they haven't implemented it properly. Apartment numbers seem to get lost, even though it'll show up clear as day on the EatStreet receipt. Now, if you think the long-suffering delivery driver is trying to play you, take a look at the boxes: no full address on the sticker. None.  I feel for them, and decided to call in and see what's up. Rude guy on the phone, not too wild about grabbing a manager. He eventually tried to call a manager (since this was a process failure), and the manager decided they had something better to do with their time.  \"Look, what went wrong,\" I asked, my blood sugar officially crashed. \"What can we, the customer, do to fit your process?\"  Wrong question.  I got my late food. It was cold. I let them know it was cold. Well, too bad for me! Should've called or sent a carrier pigeon if I wanted hot food.  Their only saving grace are the drivers, who are trying their best. But this place is garbage."}
{"text":"I've had too many experiences with staff here that involve ineptitude on the phone, navigating to my address, or accepting coupons or the Yelp! discount offered when you check in with the yelp app.  I had to speak my credit card number FIVE TIMES before the guy got it right and my call took more than seven minutes.  Today will be the last time I order a pizza from them because they've consistently failed to deliver quality service, though they HAVE done consistently well at the preparation of my pizza, which does arrive still hot and cooked \"well done, not burnt\" like I ask.  But when they finally arrived with my last pizza, late, I found that in spite of the fact that they clearly had my street name correct over the phone, the paperwork had the wrong street name. Further, this, my last pizza, was undercooked, and all of the center portions were a bit raw.  Such disappointing incompetence."}
{"text":"I had never heard of Quad City style pizza until I encountered Pizza Pit. But it turns out we have this type of pizza all over in Indiana. Maybe it should be called Midwest Style.   I loved it. It reminded me a lot of a place in my hometown called Arts. In fact, I just had the pepperoni, nothing fancy, and it was one my favorite pizzas in the Valley. On the other hand, other people in my family were not so thrilled, so maybe I loved it so much because it is familiar, yet rare around here.   Now the service was not so good. A little on the unfriendly side.  I'll see if that is the case next time or if it was just a fluke. The place looks nice in a pizza place sort of way, so no points off there. Prices are high, but you get a lot of topping--these are pretty heavy compared to, for example, a New York style pizza.   I'd give it five stars except for the service. I'll for sure be a regular here...at least for carry-out."}
{"text":"Checked this place out today and was really impressed! Had delicious garlic butter cheesy breadsticks and a ceasar salad. The food was great, but what really stood out to me was the service. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, and gave us a really great overview of what \"Quad City\" style pizza was all about... because I had never even heard of it before today!   They have the walls decorated with pizza boxes signed by people from the quad cities, which gives it a really personal feel.   I watched the waitress deliver a taco pizza to a table across the room, and I'm DEFINITELY ordering that next time- it looked out of control!  They're not close to where I live, or I'd eat there more often."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Ok well I had a groupon which led me to this place and it is good.  I tried the wings and the pizza.  I had the honey hot wings which had decent taste to the sauce but the meat on the wings seemed to be a little small.   The pizza was strip cut which was not my style but that is Quad City style like this place says they are.  I had the Sicilian pie and it had good flavor but just wasn't great on any level.    If I was in the area and starving I'd go back especially for the lake-view dining but I won't go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"Potential eaters here, beware - the food is pretty terrible.  Just about the worst pizza I've had in memory, and the chicken wings were quite overcooked (apparently that is a hard thing to time just right!).    To the owners - I am shocked you are still in business, but  I wish you all the best and hope you will land on your feet - I'm not sure how long this adventure will last for you."}
{"text":"My first time to the pizza pit was great.  Pizza was excellant, my son loved the cheese bread and staff was very friendly.  Overall the cost is average of most places.  What did it for me was the dough they brought out for my son to pretend making his own pizza.  Plus you gotta love the half bake that you can take home.  I will definately go back and bring the family with me especially when the weather cools down to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"Brak has been remiss in not reviewing Pizza Pit before now.  We originally dined here on a Groupon last year, and loved it.  But for no good reason other than it's not particularly close to home (though not a terrible haul either), we hadn't been back.  I was recently reminded that it's a place we should visit again.  We've now been back 3 times in the past few weeks, and I'm happy to report that Pizza Pit rates a SOLID 5 stars on the Brak-o-Meter.  How so? It's not a chain, it's a family-run joint, and looks and feels like it.  Lots of good TV's for catching whatever ballgame you're interested in watching.  A unique style of pizza, named after Fred Garvin's stomping grounds, the quad cities area, located at the Iowa/Illinois boundary.  It's a slightly thick crust with a unique texture that is difficult for me to describe, but I like it a lot.  The toppings are placed under the cheese, and the pizza is strip-cut rather than pie-cut (though I'm sure they'd oblige a pie-cut request).  Salads are bueno too, and there are sandwiches and stuff I haven't tried but I'm sure are good.. I just go straight for the pizza & a small salad and I'm one happy creature.  If you like supporting local businesses that deliver solid value, friendly service, and a great and unique twist on the old favorite pizza pie, then do yourself a favor and give Pizza Pit a try.  Brak is confident you'll be glad you did.  It's now on the short list of Brak's regular rotation joints, even if it's a bit of a drive.  Good stuff, Maynard!"}
{"text":"What has the world done to the people in this place to make them hate life as they do?  And why does that translate to the mediocre food?    You can do better for pizza.  Hell, practically across the street from this place is Salvatore's.  You'll spend a bit more, but it'll be worth it.  This place slaps grease and cheese on cardboard, wraps it cardboard, and hands it to you with a look on their face that plainly says, \"I should have listened to my teachers in high school.\""}
{"text":"It was around 7:30 when I walked in with my family. It was dark in the parking lot, real dark.  There were two other tables finishing up, the young girl said just seat yourself after my wife flagged her down and asked if we should just stand and wait or help ourselves. The young server took our order and brought our first round of drinks and that was all we saw of her until the salads came. The first salad ( large house ) she set in front of the 20 month old baby with very fast hands, luckily not as fast a my wife's, disaster averted. After that all items were set much further from the little man.  Pizza came out timely but it took the poor little server a few tries to get the pizzas on the stands. This would be the last time of course we saw our server unless she was flagged down or verbally addressed. We were the only people in the joint at this point.  Pizza was overall very bland. What little sauce there was tasted canned. Sausage tasted freezer burned. Kids definitely didnt dig on the pepperoni and cheese and it is hard to dissuade them from any pizza. They did like it when they were allowed to pile on parmesan adding some modicum of flavor. Crust was not my least favorite ever but was very inconsistent in the feel depending on what part of the pizza i was eating. Salads were passable as it is pretty hard to screw up a house salad and an Antipasto salad, although the kalamatta olives had seen better days.  Overall, we wont be returning unless new ownership and recipes come in."}
{"text":"I just watched them prepare pizza for about 15 minutes. This place is a dark hole. None of the staff we are gloves.  I noticed multiple times when the lady would rub her hands on her pants, then get right back to touching the dough. Then, hung the dough on her arm while grabbing a pizza pan. Mmmm. Arm hair. This place is gross. Don't think I can eat the pizzas I just bought."}
{"text":"Oh Pizza Pit.  Thank you for reminding me why we quit ordering from you in the first place. Ordered a gyro plate delivered (Athens Gyros in Pizza Pit).  Took almost an hour to get here.  When it did, the gyro meat was jerky. Seriously.  I don't know how long the fries sat before they were delivered, but they were dead as hell.  Called the manager.  \"Oh yeah, that was brought to my attention that the meat was all dried out.  We threw that pan out.  Your order must have been made from that.  Happy to send you a new one.\"  Are you freaking kidding me?   25 minutes later, it arrived.  I live 1.5 miles away.  1.5 miles.  25 minutes.   Wasn't dried out, but sure wasn't good either. Never again."}
