{"text":"First time here,  ordered ropa vieja and plantaines,  everything fresh and home made,  food was great can't wait until i come back again to try something new,  live music was a nice touch"}
{"text":"Awesome! I had chicken tacos and my friends the potato with bacon yummy! Rafael es may simpatico y un excellent host!"}
{"text":"I found about this place via Facebook, decided to check it out , the music that was playing on Friday \"tropical\" was perfect for my taste on music !! I felt bad because it was kind of empty but I actually liked it that way so it was so crowded and hot like other places I've gone , I had a chance to talk to the manager who explained how hard they have been working on this club , fired all the stuff and decided to step in (him and the other owner) as the staff . He was really good at customer service, he went that extra mile for us , thanks!  Bathrooms were very clean (yes, I know , that's weird) haha  I used to go to club downtown but it's so hard to get a drink there , too hot and lately they changed the music and bachata all night isn't really my thing .  Highly recommend this place , I have not tried the food yet but I'm planning to go soon :)"}
{"text":"Poor customer service in the evening, when it turns into a club!!!! The waiters saw me standing there for a long time and didn't even ask me what I wanted. Their excuse is that they don't speak English. Well I speak Spanish. I then tell them I want Dos Equis on draft...they don't have it. Then my friend orders Tito's and pineapple juice...they don't have Tito's...WTH? Get your $#&t together. With so much competition in the area for good food and music, you must come correct with superb customer service. Needless to say, I won't be back ever. I was ready to tell all my salsa dancing friends to come to this place, but now I have to relay my experience, and let them judge for themselves."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere.  I was hesitant because it's a little hidden, but it was worth the risk. The Cuban sandwich is a must have."}
{"text":"First time here Loved the Cuban sandwich! Very friendly! Don't let the lack of street exposure fool you, it's hidden a bit but well worth it. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious Cuban/Mexican fusion with a neighborhood bar feel. I recommend the Cuban sandwich. The bread was soft and flaky, meat was flavorful, and who doesn't love pickles. Must try either the yuca fries or fried plantains with the garlic oil. Hubby had the Ropa Vieja, which is a tangy pot roast over rice with tomatoes and onion. He loved it!"}
{"text":"MUST get the Cuban sandwich. Absolutely delicious nom nom nom. Authentic Cuban food. We got the appetizer sampler as well, which was good, but I made the mistake of thinking it'd be Cuban samples and it wasn't. The bartender is very friendly. Overall, happy with the experience and will definitely be returning. It turns into a club on weekend nights. Haven't done that yet, but if you like salsa, merengue, or bachata then it should be a winner."}
{"text":"This sparsely appointed setting, cavernous space, non-specific décor and warehouse-like atmosphere scarcely lends itself to it's namesake in Miami or the Cuban Lounge scene!  Although offering tremendous dance area and seating area, I found the décor lacking in either Cuban or Mexican motifs or acoutremonts, with very few and scattered decorations!  It was heartwarming to meet the hard-working owners who are striving to make this place work and their perseverance in doing so.  They have a way to go... the noshes offered in their ambiguous and small menu, with items many unavailable when ordering, barely reflect traditional nor nouveau Cuban or Mexican fare.  Tacos, plantains, yuca - limited.  In strong agreement with other Yelpers, their Cuban sandwich is good, but by no means a Cuban Sandwich (see my Cuban Sandwich entry in my Yelp List entry:  Cuban Sandwiches [El Cubano] at https://www.yelp.com/list/cuban-sandwiches-el-cubano-north-miami).  We visited late afternoon, early evening - too early for their DJ floor show, but can see that they have the potential for dance and frolic based on their DJ set up, dance area and promotionals.  Recommendations: please expand your limited alcoholic beverage repertoire; increase your Cuban and Mexican cuisine offerings; and by all means a wait staff that can speak English will be beneficial to the English-only crowd.  I look forward to coming back, I see great potential in Calle 8, see you soon?  Bon appétit from El Saguecero (aka: Gástro Ecléctico)!"}
{"text":"I live down the street from this club and I decided to go in to check it out. It was pretty empty. The guys that own the place were pretty cool! Gave me free drinks and hung out with them as well.I guess as time flew by I saw my leasing office have a party and they noticed I was there and I guess I danced with them and partied lol it was very weird but awesome! I like this place. It's pretty cool! If I could I'd come again but I don't go out anymore. Definitely a place to hang out! Good music and vibes!"}
{"text":"One of the owners were serving us and he has great hospitality! Very authentic  and I recommend to anyone who is looking for Cuban food or even Cuban vibes. This is the ONLY place in AZ you can get this."}
{"text":"Arguably one of the best Cuban sandwiches I've ever had. And HUGE!  I came here after work one night because I've been promising to treat myself to something from this newly-opened Cuban restaurant. I was the only person there, likely because construction to the attached dry cleaner and the fencing cordoning it off gives the impression Calle 8 isn't open. It is. There was a moderate wait from placing my order and the food coming out, but everything is made fresh. So, worth it. When I received my Cubano, I almost fell off my seat: this thing was twice the size of other Cubanos I've eaten throughout the Valley, and for the same amount. The fresh, hand-cut fries were piping hot and sooo tasty.  One of  the owners told me they have live music/DJ on Fridays and Saturdays. Worth a check out.  I can't wait to go back and try other menu offerings. But I'm still digesting that Cubano."}
