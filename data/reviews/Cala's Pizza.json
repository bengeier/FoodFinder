{"text":"I had just moved to Mentor and asked a friend, who has the best pizza around? I was told Cala's and I will admit that their pizza is good... when they don't screw up the order! The problem is they messed up my orders most times. The last time was beyond ridiculous and they refused to give me a refund. I called my credit card company and refused to pay for a pizza I didn't order. And I took the high road and didn't write them a bad review. Now over a year later, I thought I'd give them another chance, however I was refused server for them screwing up my order and me not wanting to pay for it. If you want just a regular pizza, by all means... feel free to eat Cala's but if you have any special requests that the idiots can't seem to read or comply with... don't waste your time or money, they will get it wrong and they won't care!"}
{"text":"This used to be mine and my husbands favorite pizza to order but our last two experiences made it easy to decide never to order here again. The kids working there should be fired, unless the owner likes them saying the \"F\" word in front of customers and talking about how drunk they were over the weekend. Also, my order of Garlic bread I used to get that was nice and thick was now 3 thin pieces of bread and they forgot the cheese. The only reason I give them 2 stars is because the pizza is good."}
{"text":"Ordered a med pizza supreme & wings. Pizza had a really wet bottom crust . Which was very gross almost gave the pizza a uncooked texture . Sausage chunks are Ridiculously large not sensible size . The wings looked dry on top under them was a hot sauce butter mixture that was separated n look unappetizing. The only good thing from this 28$ meal was the celery sticks w ranch . Would never order here again .  Note to the cook .. drain  veggies more before tossing them on pizza or cook the pizza longer ."}
{"text":"Ordered small deluxe pizza tonight and half meatball sub cost $20 and tipped $7 pizza was a joke it was supposed to be a deluxe but was only some big chunks of sausage one or two mushrooms a ton of sauce and hardly any cheese and only big enough for one person not worth it! Wasn't even close to being good talked to manager who was rude only to get no where totally unprofessional will not order from here again 0stars"}
{"text":"Customer service is severely lacking. The girl that waited on me today was unfriendly, never smiled and borderline rude. It wasn't even busy so I am not sure what she was so bitter about. And my order was wrong and my garlic bread wasn't cooked. I love the Willowick location... Stick with that one."}
{"text":"Just passing through....  This place consists of four (4) 2 tops....  it was snowing outside and we were craving pizza....luckily we found this place open.   yeah i want to be a fan of any pizza place i go to....give me that warm pie taste stacked with Italian sausage and pepperoni. i don't eat pizza that often because of it's addicting qualities...yet when i do hit up a pizza joint I go \"all in!\"  Cala's IS ALL THAT! The only thing I can tell you to expect is Quality Pie! We had the 12\" homemade Italian Sausage and Pepperoni. But the best thing about their pie has to be the sauce - -  Rich Italian flavors in marinara.   Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"I tried it once so far I thought it was pretty good where I used to live there was only MAYBE 2 places that had decent pizza and neither delivered and both were rather lacking in customer service. REALY LACKING! but we got pizza wings a couple differant subs all were good only thing wrong was delivery I delivered pizza for a while and it was before you had cell phones that knew more than you did. When I ordered I gave them my cell number just moved in and land line was disconnected it's my dads house so I know what the old number was takes delivery guy forever later the shop calls me on my cell to tell me delivery driver had a lot of orders but he's on his way now ok no problem about almost a half hour later still no delivery guy so I go outside to look and get some air and a few moments later I see a car come down street realy slow comes all the way down turns and drives back up street and goes left about 30 seconds later here comes same car down street real slow goes right passed me and turns around again and goes back to the top of street and just sits there I'm thinking he's going to turn around and come back but he just keeps sitting there I'm now standing at the end of my driveway looking right at his car my street is NOT very long at all my porch light is in and nothing so I call the shop and they said he should be there we will call him I told them I think he's at top of street about 1-2 mins later guy turns around and finally comes to my driveway apologizes and says he tried to call but my line was disconnected. I did not give them the disconnected number why were they calling it? Where did they even get it?  I know he's a teenager so I'm pretty positive he had a smart phone where the phone will lead you right to the house (wish I had one when I was delivering) I don't understand I'm even on a dead end street with a cultisack how do you get lost? But food was still hot and he was pretty embarrassed and he's a teenager I know I was completely brain dead when I was a teenager so I can't be to ticked off it's just karma I guess but other than that it was all good I'll order again I'm sure"}
{"text":"So its a friday night and i place my order at 6:05 pm. I order a meatball sub and frys. O usually do pick up instead of delivery but this time i decided against it. It takes an hour for my sub to get here. Im starving. The moment of glory. I just get just my sub. I call back. They ask if i want a credit or run out an order of frys. I ask them to run out an order of frys. It gets here at 7:52. The sub is fantastic, the frys are bland and cold. Ill stick to pick up from now on. Should of gotten a credit."}
