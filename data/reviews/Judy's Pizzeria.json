{"text":"Avoid at all costs.  Apparently there was once a Judy who could cook Italian food.  Neither of these things are true about the current owners.  Now, what you've got is a very rude Indian couple who have no idea how to cook Italian food.  We ordered a veal sandwich, and the meat tasted funny and it was soggy, served on stale bread (the wrong kind for an italian sandwich too).  The baked panzerotti we ordered was deep fried but not actually cooked ... just sort of a soggy mess oozing grease out of the bag.  When I called about the incorrect order, the extremely rude wife just huffed about the fact they were closing and hung up.  Maybe when they bought the place from the original owner they should have paid for a few cooking and service lessons.  Eating Chef Boyardee out of a can is a more authentic Italian experience than this garbage."}

{"text":"It's just horrible pizza...Must be a tax write off or something.  Sorry but it's just not very good."}
{"text":"Scott L's review holds true. There once was a \"Judy\". She was the nicest little old Italian lady and she made one of the meanest pizza's I ever had the chance to enjoy. Ahhhh old memories.   Unfortunately, the time came for her to sell the place. Skip forward to present time and ya, it's crap. Wouldn't eat here if it was the last place that sold food.   Avoid at all costs. Surprised they're still open though lol , who the hell eats here?"}
