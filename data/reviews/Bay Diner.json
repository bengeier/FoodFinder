{"text":"Live within walking distance and frequent often.  Great food, great service!  Only wish it was a bit bigger.  Like that there is a first-come counter.  My favorite item is the ranchero omelette.  Also love the breakfast sandwiches and the tots are a great alternative to hash browns.  My only feedback would be to carry Splenda.  Only \"pink\" (Sweet n Low\") aside from sugar for coffee.  And flavored creamer cups (only half and half)"}
{"text":"This is your quintessential diner except normally you have to shrug and say \"you get what you pay for\" at a diner. I think this is a step above because it's clean and has good service. I don't love diner food in general but the breakfasts here are awesome.  The lunch/dinner fare is what you'd expect from a diner: good, hearty but it won't blow you away."}
{"text":"Great place for a good meal. They have the best pancakes!! Tater toys are awesome too! Staff is very friendly and attentive. A small place, so there is often a wait, but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Clean, good omelets, and super friendly service. We love coming in for a late breakfast and the staff is always great. Love the gyro omelet and BELT sandwich. Nice to have a local option for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! Get there before 10AM on weekends if you don't want to wait in line."}
{"text":"We love this place for breakfast!  It's nice to support a local restaurant in our town and it's nice to have a local breakfast joint nearby!  The diner is kid friendly and the service is nice and polite.  I usually get scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns and mixed fruit (which is extra, instead if the bread).  My husband gets a larger sized meal that includes the bay cakes, and these are really good!  I always steal a few bites from his plate. I give this 4-stars because it is rather small and doesn't have enough high chair accessible tables.  The other reason is the breakfast sausage, it's just ok.  They should try a different kind, maybe from a local source (just an idea as I'm sure this would be a cost)."}
{"text":"Great local diner. Traditional breakfast menu with an addition of some specialty items. Great service, good quality and prices. Try the meat lovers omelette, best in Bay Village."}
{"text":"Great diner. Went here for breakfast. Good portions and prices. Coffee was good. As out of towners, this was exactly what you would expect from a diner nothing fancy. Only note of warning, the avocado was a little slimy (didn't seem freshly cut) but it tasted fine, that's probably the only thing I would have passed on. Would definitely go back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Walked in on Sunday noon and the place was packed.  Very leery at first, as the place had a grease and burnt toast smell.  While we were waiting more and more people walked in the door, all happy to wait.   I was happy we stayed.   Good food, though my sausage patty could have stayed on the griddle another 30-60 seconds.   My water never went dry   Would come back if ever in this area again"}
{"text":"The only issues I have had while eating breakfast here is the biscuits and gravy. Gravy was bland, extremely pasty, instead of sausage I got what seemed to be grill chips. Gross. Not sure what the \"biscuit\" was. The policy of getting charged if you bring your own food/drink is a JOKE. If someone already paid for it elsewhere then why do they need to get charged to bring in a minor item for dietary restrictions the diner doesn't carry? I can understand bringing in a huge meal and not eating anything the Diner has, but to be charged to bring in a tea bag because of diet restrictions is laughable. Whatever, on with the point...   On a positive note the omelets are the best and the Western Omelette NEVER fails. Can't go wrong with chocolate chip and peanut butter pancakes, or the French toast. The tater tots are a MUST."}
{"text":"Had lunch there for the first time today. A cute, smaller diner setting. Nice relaxed surrounding. Waitresses were nice and friendly. We had The Philly Steak sandwich, Veggie wrap, and a kids cheeseburger. Fresh cut fries and fresh chips. All were very tasty. For 2 adults and 1 child, the bill was under $30. My sister has been there many times and says other meals have been very good as well."}
{"text":"This isn't the divey, greasy food, monstrous portion place that I imagine when I see the word \"diner.\" It's a clean little strip-mall restaurant that plays great music. Service is polite and darn fast. My Rueben was ordinary, but I'll never speak an ill word against tots. After reading other reviews, I'll definitely return when I'm in the mood for breakfast."}
{"text":"We live pretty close to bay diner. It's our go-to breakfast restaurant on the weekends. The food is good and the service is fast. I'm not a huge breakfast fan so I love that they have tater tots in a few different varieties on the breakfast menu.  The Cajun tots are great and spicy.  The restaurant does fill up fast, so we prefer to go to breakfast early. A great place to take family."}
{"text":"Kids and I went there for breakfast.  After just a short wait we were seated and the service was outstanding.  Highly recommend the western omelette and the kids thought the pancakes (the size of dinner plates) with peanut butter chips were the best they've ever had.  They suggest you add grape jelly to them!"}
{"text":"Good food, stuffed full omelet, tater tots were great. Coffees was good. Service fantastic. And the place itself is nice and clean. We will be back."}
{"text":"Bay Diner, my local go-to. It never disappoints! Breakfasts here are reasonable and big, if you want it all, like me. Bays big breakfast will suffice! A small unassuming location with plenty of great breakfast-lunch-and dinner options. I bring friends here and they have tried some out of the box dishes and have been pleasantly surprised. This says a lot! Stop in when in town."}
{"text":"Great food, servers and atmosphere. Clean & friendly. A Bay favorite with locals. Perfect recipe for a successful small diner."}
{"text":"Nice local place in Bay Village. Enjoyed breakfast and tried the two eggs, bacon and hash browns.  Eggs were cooked to order and were light and fluffy, bacon was crispy and hash was brown.    Seating is limited but adds to the ambience of a small diner environment with a nice bar for singles or doubles.  Will be back soon."}
{"text":"I like to come here whenever I'm going out for breakfast. I prefer the \"home-cooked\" feel over the commercial chains any day. They give great portions in food and options. The service is always quick and friendly. My two favorites are the country fried steak and the corned beef and swiss omelette. If you're a fan of tater tots, get them. They're super crispy without being overdone. My only wish is that they'd get a cappuccino machine. I don't drink plain coffee and that leaves my options at juice, milk, soda, or hot chocolate. But that's just me."}
{"text":"Stopped in and had a decent breakfast Tuesday morning at the Bay Diner while I was out running errands. The diner is located in the middle of a strip mall just north of the railroad tracks in Bay Village right off of Dover Center road.  The interior was clean orderly and well lite, background music was load enough to make out the song without interfering with anyone's conversation.   Sat at the counter and was promptly offered coffee and a menu.  Typical breakfast choices and I opted for eggs over easy, hash browns, bacon and toast. My breakaway brought out quickly and everything was done to order. Price seemed fair for the quality and quantity of food served."}
{"text":"Love this place and glad to see a non-chain doing well! I usually opt for breakfast, regardless of the time of day I stop in. It's no frills but that's what I love about diners. Their breakfasts are always hearty and plentiful at a very good price. The Bay Cakes are legit! I'm all about these things. The last non-breakfast item I had was their potato soup and, of course, it was great! Skip the chains and give these folks a chance. They won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Wow!! Our server Nicholas took really good care of us. Best out of the way place to find. Seems mostly locals. Place fills up fast, for good reason. Price is just right. Don't go to a chain restaurant, come here you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I really liked this place, Lots of tasty food to choose from. Fresh homemade fries too. Service was good. Wish they gave more fries. Chicken Cordon Bleu is top notch!."}
{"text":"On our way out of town from a family vacation, we stopped at Bay Diner because of its quality Yelp Reviews.  Aside from a pretty small waiting area for our family of seven and a little bit of a 'frazzled' vibe from the hostess at a sudden rush of customers, the diner worked hard to accomodate.  The food was exceptional and every one of our (picky) eaters was full and satisfied.  They even made a 'big deal' about selecting some of our kids' artwork to display in the front case.  Will definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"Nice little local place.  American style food - exactly what you'd expect.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Bay Diner never disappoints!!  I work just a couple of miles away and this is easily one of my favorite lunch spots around (even if I'm craving breakfast).  Buffalo chicken wrap is great!  And comes with some kick ass tater tots!    I had the turkey club sandwich for lunch today and it is one of the best sandwiches.  They don't give you fake lunch meat-  instead they pile tender, juicy pieces of oven roasted turkey on some great wheat bread.  Also comes with some great, fresh tasting bacon.  Service is always great too.  P.s.  You're doing it all wrong if you don't order one of their homemade cookies!!! They bake peanut butter cups into their PB cookies!!! And only $1.50!!!!"}
{"text":"Let's face it if you are reading this you probably slept in Bay Village last night. When it comes to breakfast there is no reason to reinvent the wheel. The locally owned restaurant works hard to accommodate everyone who comes in, but they are limited in space. You can tell that the owners are hard at work whenever you are in and there is something comforting about that"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Breakfast lunch or dinner great!! Affordable and the people that work there are fabulous. Nick!! TVs for games. A bar area for seating. No booze. Have great milkshakes."}
{"text":"This is my favorite diner near us. It's hard to find a good diner for breakfast as many are going out of business. I love their baycakes and tots."}
{"text":"Excellent buffalo chicken salad, fresh, flavorful and not overpowered by buffalo sauce with happens frequently at other places. My only complaint is the fries, they are very good but come on small chopped up segments. Great servers, squeaky clean and good all around local business more than deserving of local support."}
{"text":"Bay diner has been here for ages.   Usually places get stale and stagnant.  This place gets better.  Breakfast is a good value.  Clean neat great service and value."}
{"text":"No doubt, we should come here more often than we do! It's a great, local diner and the kids love coming here. I'd love to try dinner sometime, too. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant with a menu focused on breakfast and sandwiches. I expected a diner to have more dinner options. So I ended up with soup and sandwich. The onion soup was pretty standard. The turkey club sandwich was a good straight-forward turkey sandwich with bacon. But when I got to the  bites where there was no mayo, the meat was dry. Very reasonable price and decent service."}
{"text":"I go there at least 3 times a week.  Great place and great owners.  Quiet and a family place to eat.  Good home made food by the owner.  Not a chain place at all, just family owned and run.  The sever are all nice and friendly also.  You can get  breakfast  all day long !"}
{"text":"Very quiet, nice change of pace from noisy sports bars! Good menu and the Mediterranean vegetable was great, but the young waiter was baffled when I asked if the vegetables were imported from the Mediterranean. He was going to ask his manager! I got a turkey sandwich and it was very fresh and fed me the next day too. Overall quick in and out, quiet and not too pricey."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice,both times just after they opened. The service was borderline rude and the food was uniformly over cooked. Scrambled eggs were rubbery,toast was slightly burnt and the hash browns were also slightly burnt and tasted like they were reheated.Even the pancakes were overcooked(dark brown and crusty). Both times. On the plus side,the one cup of coffee I got on each visit was good.Refills weren't forthcoming however. Not going back again."}
{"text":"This is not a millennial breakfast with snooty drinks and fusion food. This is good hearty food that is VERY plentiful for the prices. On the small side but we waited less than 5 minutes to be seated. Food was excellent all the way around, good quality. Would go back if I'm in Bag Village side of town again."}
{"text":"Friendly little place in a strip mall. Lots of little ones eating and staff was great with them.  Had the Buffalo Chicken and the bun was soft and chewy - perfect. Brought a piece of the pumpkin pie back to the hotel and it was really good. If you don't like kids running around while you eat go somewhere else but I had a nice quick meal."}
{"text":"I went to Bay Diner again yesterday and the Bay Cakes were amazing! Once again, great service as well.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place. The food is terrific (although based on other reviews, it sounds like I need to try the pancakes and tater tots next time!)  But perhaps what left the best impression on me was that the last time I took my two little girls there for breakfast, my 2 yr old had an embarrassing melt down, and everyone from the staff to the other guests were so cool about it. One older gentleman sitting at the counter even came over with the Funnies section of his newspaper. And another table of ladies made silly faces at her from a distance to cheer her up. Once the temper tantrum passed, folks kept stopping by to chat and let me know they've \"been there.\" It made me feel as if we were among family, not judgmental strangers. I know all of that has nothing to do with the food. But it's just an overall lovely place to spend a morning. Screaming babies aside. ;o)"}
{"text":"Fairly busy, got a seat at the bar.  Wife and I each had an omelette and I ordered the half order of french toast.  I liked my omelette as did my wife, but the french toast was nothing to go back for, it's one of my favorite things to order out because I can't make it as well as a restaurant.  Coffee was fine and service was good, not a place we'll frequent though as there was no \"must have\" hook."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast spot with all the diner style favorites. The food came out fast and service was friendly. It was definitely the quietest diner I have ever been to, even though all the tables were full."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast the other Sunday and it was delicious. It was crowded, but not a bad wait. It seemed like a lot of people were picking up to-go orders.  Good to know.   I had eggs over medium and bacon with pancakes.  Everything was so good!  I loved how the pancakes had a crispy texture along the outside.    I have been here before for dinner and was impressed as well.  I had the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and green beans.  It was delish as well!  I will definitely be back for both breakfast and dinner!"}
{"text":"Love coming here. Small place with great food. Service is great. Prices are perfect for what you get. Best tater totes!"}
{"text":"Great little diner with delicious food! Gets crowded on Sunday mornings but worth waiting. Pancakes are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Good, solid breakfast place. Great service, reasonable prices and selection. TVs everywhere. What a diner should be like."}
{"text":"Clean, cozy and coffee refilling, Bay Diner is a good place for a quick lunch or a nice home-cooked breakfast. They even sell the small cereal boxes if you're craving that! There is a small counter to eat at and a decent amount of tables for the space. The turnover rate is pretty quick, so if there is a wait, it won't be long. Traditional Americana food at reasonable prices. The servers are always friendly as well. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Small local diner which took some time to find. Came here after church, so it was a bit crowded. Was able to sit at the counter. The servers were very friendly as they gave me a menu.   Ordered a chicken fried steak with a short stack of pancakes. Would say it was the best comfort food I had in a long time. The steak wasn't to greasy and full of flavor. The pancakes were so moist, yet not too sweet. Would definitely come back for a full stack."}
{"text":"Good stuff. Great service. Always consistent. Would recommend. Better than any chain."}
{"text":"I love it when hotels don't offer a breakfast bar: it means I get to try a local diner.  This is one of  the good ones: easy to find and park, friendly service, great food with a number of specialty breakfasts.  (I had the Greek, with gyro meat.)  Some places are too chic or too crowded.  Bay Diner really has bona fides as a no-fuss, short-order, home-cookin' place.  Next time I'll try to stop by on Thursday for chicken paprikash."}
{"text":"For a local, hole-in-the-wall diner, you can't get any better than this. It's a small place, but tables seem to turn quickly. Service was good, they're quick to refill the coffee and waters without needing to ask. Food was great as well.   I had a breakfast sandwich on an english muffin. I was expecting the english muffin to be your standard smallish size, but to my delight it was much larger. It also came with hash browns (yay!). My friend got the big breakfast with eggs, sausage, bacon, toast, hash browns and french toast. I snagged some of the french toast and it was perfect. Not real eggy at all, and fluffy like I've never seen. Prices were decent, basically what you would expect for a diner in Bay.   This is a gem of a place, I'm looking forward to trying their lunch and dinner options some time soon!"}
{"text":"My daughter and a friend went here for breakfast they had their own coffees from a coffee shop next-door.  The waitress added five dollars to the bill because they had their own coffee.  Kind of shady my kids are pretty young I think they were taken advantage of.  I would've walked out."}
{"text":"Their customer service is bad!   We would love to support our community and the local shop but I'm skipping Bay Diner from now on.  They never answer their phone to take a pick up order.  They say use online ordering.  I feel it's so rude that you are a restaurant that will not answer the phone. We've had issues with the online ordering before and the bacon, egg, cheese bagel is not on there.  A very common diner item.  I tried to order online no option, tried to call no answer, then I go into the shop and he says you are 10 mins too late to order a bacon, egg and cheese bagel.  Okay goodbye!  You do not want my money.  I would not recommend this place to others. The food is mediocre and inconsistent. Hopefully others have a better experience.  Tator tots have always been good so if you can get them ordered its worth it."}
