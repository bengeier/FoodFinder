{"text":"I went to Moes last night and had a great experience. I ordered my usual homewrecker with steak and a side of queso but this time was different. The food the was great but the customer service was over the top! The employees were constantly checking on the guest and even refilled my drink for me. I go to a lot of Moes in Charlotte but the Moes in Southpark here at Sharon corners is absolutely the best the restaurant is consistently clean and the food is always fresh and the employees act like they want to be there. I will be back and I recommend everyone to go to the Moes in Southpark it's actually clean and the food taste great!"}
{"text":"Not a good place to eat at! The girl wrapping the burritos looked like she wanted to get out of there. Ingredients were not fresh, rice was burnt and the finished product didn't taste good at all. Avoid this place if you could."}
{"text":"Love working at moes...americas favorite mexican resturaunt of all time....clean delicous great service friendly people and great managersp"}
{"text":"I actually prefer moes to chipotle. There's much more options. Like the black olives and fresh jalapeños and cilantro. Not to mention the delicious sautéed mushrooms and onions.  I get a veggie burrito every time I go and I haven't been disappointed yet.  My only critique would be the guacamole. It's just not on the same level as chipotles guac. It's always slightly brown and watery.   Also A+ for the rewards program! Put in your number at the register and you get a free entrée after 10 visits. My husband and I have both earned free meals already."}
{"text":"1st and last time eating at this place. The food was bland and, at the same time, odd tasting. The peppers and onions tasted like they had been slightly pickled. The chicken was dry and absolutely tasteless and the rice was just not good. The chips were heavy and tasted like they had been fried in old oil.  Ended up throwing this away and eating saltine crackers.  The plating was also sloppy and unappetizing."}
{"text":"Service was great, everyone was super friendly and efficient, but the food was sub-par.  If you don't have much time for lunch and have to grab something it will do, otherwise, I would recommend continuing your search.  Good music though!"}
{"text":"Love Moe's, and this one is in a great location. Nothing beats the Moe Monday special with a side of queso.   My only complaint is that the soda fountains aren't maintained well at all. They have two of the Freestyle Coke machines (the type with 3849384 drink combinations) but they're always out of half of their soda types and flavor syrups. Frustrating when I'm craving a Diet cherry vanilla Coke and the machine is out of one or all of the things that make that combination. Not to mention it makes the line even longer to get a drink, because people are slow enough as it is to decide what they want!   Also, one time I submitted a customer service complaint because the woman at the cash register was very rude and wouldn't accept my Foursquare check-in coupon (she no longer works there, the girl who is always at the register now is super nice) and a manager called and was very apologetic and offered to mail me some Moe Bucks. It was a nice gesture in theory, but then the Moe Bucks never came. Lame. I love Moe's to much too stop going there, though, and this location is so convenient to my office!"}
{"text":"Moe's is ok for when you don't have the time or energy to haul yourself to Kensington Market for more authentic Mexican stuff.   I usually order the vegetarian Burrito bowl and most of the time, the ingredients are fresh. The service is friendly, the prices are ok.  It's a couple of notches above the Taco Bells of the world."}
{"text":"First time eating at a Moe's and will be the last. Food way overpriced for what you get. Quality of food no good. Rice not cooked.Salads left a lot to be desired. Better food choices in the market."}
{"text":"SLOW to get through the service line. The menu titles give little to no description of what each item is - something like a Joey's bag of donuts - what on earth is that at a burrito place?!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best burritos around!  Far better than their competitors with way more choices and my burritos are always exploding!"}
{"text":"Meh, it's decent Tex-mex. I'd go to a local place first, then Chipolte, then Qdoba, there here, then Taco Bell. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Was a nice experience to have a new twist on mexican food, it reminded me of Chipotle, but a lot better! The staff was very friendly and interactive through the whole process of getting my meal and then paying for it. I had chicken nachos with queso, bacon, jalapeños, and tomatoes and it was delicious! Will definitely be back to try some more foods from here!"}
{"text":"I love this place they are so cool and they are always so nice,. the atmosphere is awesome. I come here often and this is one of the cleanest moes in town. manager Tony and Asst Mgr Keith they are always walking around and making sure that the patrons are taking care of. KEEP IT UP GUYS"}
{"text":"Moe's is consistently good.  The people are fast and friendly... Welcome to Moes!.  And the food is great.  Love the Burrito and Queso!    My only complaint is that they nickel and dime you, ie if you want Queso in the burrito it's \"a little extra\" and if you buy the side of Queso, it's not very big for what they charge.  But other than that, the food is great."}
{"text":"I eat at this location a good bit, and continue to return to it. I really like their burritos, especially when they have the moe Monday deal on. Their chips on the other hand leave a bad taste in my mouth, but maybe that's just me. The food always seems to tear me up though. I normally do well with Mexican food (I know this is Tex-Mex), but this location always does me in. I'm fine at any other Moe's I go to. I don't know what it is, but this place is not good on my digestive tract. The food is pretty good tho!"}
{"text":"Filthy, Dirty....two people on shift and one customer when I arrived and one was busy talking with a friend.  Floor stain with cola and the trash cans were overflowing with trash and caked on filth. All I could think about was that episode of Under Cover Boss...you can see that the franchise owner does not care about their investment or their customers."}
{"text":"Moes is my go to place on Mondays. If you get there before 5, your wait will be minimal and food made to perfection! All of the staff are friendly and helpful. Just wish the old style of points would have rolled over into the new awards system."}
{"text":"Tried moe's for the first time this week, and it didn't live up to the hype. Burrito was fine but nothing special. Staff was friendly, but I'll stick to chipotle or qdoba."}
{"text":"one of my go to mexican restaurants    i love it there and i love when they say \"welcome to moes\"    the queso is bomb   everything is fresh and i always feel full and happy when im there great for kids too"}
{"text":"There is very little times when I have the perfect vegetarian nachos. This restaurant had the nachos I have been searching for in a Mexican restaurant.  This Mexican grill is Moe's Southwestern grill.     This restaurant also had many opinions to put on the food you ordered.  I loved that about this restaurant.  The opinions were endless just likes Subways selection!  This selection included, guacamole, sour cream, pickled jalapenos, fresh jalapenos, lettuce, tomatoes, melted cheese, beans, rice, salsa, and much more!     Additionally, this restaurant had very affordable prices! I was worried that the price would be super big! In fact, each person is under $10!  Also, as soon as I saw the cash register I thought it was a low price!  This is one of the reasons I loved this restaurant.     This restaurant is also a family restaurant! This place is kid appropriate too.  You can bring your kids, wife, or husband. I love this restaurant for this and many reasons!    One con about this restaurant is it is a bit loud!  When I was at Moe's a softball team came in!  Luckly, I was already out of line but that softball team was super loud!  Also, the softball team made the team super loud!     That was my experience at Moe's. Both of my pros and cons about that restaurant. Including the price, the toppings,  and more."}
{"text":"Always friendly, always nice, always smiling and the food is good too! My daughter loves coming here. Decent selection of americanized mexican staples - with lots of options for kids. Completely customizable. Could use a few extra hands to help with clean up as tables and chairs can get pretty messy on \"kids eat free\" Tuesdays.."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times since their opening last year, and they are done such a tremendous job improving that i have to give them 5 stars. Staff was really friendly and honestly made me feel like i was a VIP.. Sounds corny but its true lol. Anyway I got a customized burrito bowl and it was fresh and delicious. Ill never even look at Chipotle again. Great staff, impeccably clean place, awesome food."}
{"text":"We eat at Moe's probably twice a week. We used to like this location but over the last several month, the employees in the evening have been rude, short tempered and generally disinterested in their customers. Tonight was the last time we will ever patronize this location. When we pulled up at 8:35pm for takeout (they are open until 9pm), one of the employees was turning the \"open\" sign off as we approved the door. Although there were no customers in line, we were not greeted, nor did anyone acknowledge that we were even present. We stood there for 2 minutes while they ignored us and had a conversation. This is no way to run a business if you want to keep your regular customers or any customers at all! We had always chosen this location due to the pervious good service, however we have another Moe's closer to our home which we will patronize from now on."}
{"text":"I know this is a somewhat \"fast food\" burrito joint, but I still expect a little better than this.  While the flavors of the overall burrito were ok, the \"steak\" was chewy, gristly, and had very little flavor itself.  The salsa bar was kind of cool.  I enjoy the free chips as well, but I'd have liked to had more.  I ended up eating the last third of my wife's burrito just to be full!  The coupons better be real good to lure me back again with Chipotle, Qdoba, and Burrito Loco  all close by."}
{"text":"While I generally do not like to write reviews on chain restaurants, Moe's is a worthy place to note!  My husband always gets burritos double wrapped - usually to help fill him up - but at Moe's, the double wrapping actually worked and he was unable to finish his burrito!  Nice!  I go for the quesadillas, just for a little variety.  Always a good choice.  And make sure to use up the free salsas.  The green one is amazing!!"}
{"text":"A bunch of kids running the place. None of them seem to care about anything. Zero enthusiasm and zero attention.  Such a shame to have a franchise that usually does it right elsewhere to being so lackluster in my town"}
{"text":"This Moes was very dirty, and I found a long hair in my burrito. Great customer service but the lack of cleanliness makes me think I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of MOE's but this location has no soul. I was not greeted with the usual \"Welcome to MOE's!\" at the door that I had been anticipating. I have eaten at MOE's from Lynchburg, VA to Ashland, KY all across Ohio and this was a let down. I was also disappointed in the chips. No one likes a handful of greasy, broken chip-lets for lunch. The food was ok, but like a previous poster, I was given brown guacamole. I don't think I will eat here again."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Everything is always fresh. Staff is great and always friendly. Hands down best place to get cheap and fast taco/burritos."}
{"text":"I'd heard a lot about this place through friends and co-workers,  so I was shocked to find out how poor the food was and how small the portions were.   When entering you're always greeted with \"Welcome to Moe's\",  which is nice.   But that was about it.   I ordered a Chicken Burrito with a \"free\" side of tostada chips and a drink for about 7 bucks.    Horribly overpriced for the tiny portions.  The burrito was dry,  flakey and tasteless.    It certainly did not taste like it was freshly made.  The \"free\" side order of chips is a joke.   They barely give you a handful,  and they were some of the worst I've had.    How this place got any kind of name in Charlotte is beyond me.     OVERRATED!    Right nearby is a great little Mexican restaurant called Taxco's thats miles better than Moe's.    Go there instead."}
{"text":"Fast service and the food is always fresh. Try the new pineapple cucumber salsa, it's really good!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, they have a Coke-Freestyle machine which I really like. Also I'll take a Wrong Doug over Chipotle any day."}
{"text":"Food was cold. Queso was cold. Yes we were greeted by\"welcome to Moe's\" but it was the only thing warm. First and last time. Guess I'm spoiled from going to Chipotle. Moe's to us was Taco Bellish."}
{"text":"The place was dirty.  Trash everywhere.  No one had cleaned any tables.  It was 5pm!  Ordered pork.  They grabbed a bag of \"meat\" from under the counter.  It looked like dog food (like Gaines burgers, remember those?).  It didn't taste any better.  We won't go back."}
{"text":"The service wasn't all that great. The employees were kinda just not enthused at all and kinda sassy. The gave me hardly any meat with my tacos. I've been to way better moes than this one"}
{"text":"We had a lunch meeting here today and it was great.  Store was clean an crew was great."}
{"text":"Just had a horrible gross thing happen that I am sure wouldn't have happened if the regular main guy who is either the manager or owner was there. First, this is petty but my daughter noticed we weren't greeted with the happy \"Welcome to Moe's!\"  Well, no big deal but then we sit down and the adult meals had half as many chips as the kid meals. Worst thing was I take a bite of my burrito and there is a giant chunk of an end of an onion in my burrito. The brownish skin part. Ugh. Try getting raw onion flavor out of your mouth!  And the end is the worst!  It was nasty. That being said, hopefully someone reads this because I don't want our backup dinner option to go down the tubes for my  family of 5!"}
{"text":"Very good place. I had two soft tacos with pork. I can't do spicy very well so I picked simple toppings: lettuce, tomato, cheese and sour cream. The pork had lots of flavor. You get a side of chips. I love their salsa bar. I had the salsa with black beans and corn. I can't remember the name sorry. I prefer them over Chipotle mostly because I am not allowed to have spicy food."}
{"text":"We stopped in when my daughter decided that she wanted a quesadilla instead of a pizza. We were all outside eating our meal and she refused to eat. I thought she was just being picky until I tried it. The tortilla tasted old, the chicken was dry and the overall taste was bland.   The service was quick and everyone was friendly and that is the only reason I gave it two stars."}
{"text":"This is like a cheap version of chipotle. The quality of the food is cheaper and so are the prices but its a bit too cheap for my taste.  They arent to many people here for lunch, i guess im not the only one who thinks so.  The space is decent and so is the location.  Other than that i dont think its that hot of a restaurant from what i see ."}
{"text":"Very clean, fresh food, nice staff and best burritos around.  Glad to see a Moe's because I think they are much better then that other burrito place chip"}
{"text":"Love Moe's in general! Their food is always delicious! This particular location always gets my food correct and it always tastes great! The service isn't the best though. Most of the employees look as if it was a drag to come in to work and like its killing them to be there. I dont know if morale is down among the staff or what, but it definitely projects towards the customer. The poor morale is made up for by the cool coke machine and the cute outdoor seating area. Moe's in Dilworth is the closest to my job and is about 15 minutes away, but I make the trek a couple times a month for lunch. I can overlook bad vibes as long as they get my order correct and in a timely manner and I'm satisfied with my food at the end of the day."}
{"text":"Arrived around 11:40 am before the lunch rush.  Stepped up to a fresh counter to make my bowl selections. Rice, black beans, chicken, cheese, both salsas, sour cream and lettuce.        What a perfect lunch!!!  Everything was great, I only wish they would drain the beans more. Just a pet peeve of mine    Chips were fresh and the salsa bar is a clever idea.    The \"Welcome to Moe's\" greeting gets old as you eat your meal as guests arrive."}
{"text":"My Migos took me here during lunch. They said it would be great. They lied. The unfriendly girl who attempted to make my burrito failed and after what seemed forever fumbled her way through it. I took a bite and the burrito was cold. My Migos also hyped up the free chips and salsa. The chips were stale and and the salsa was bad. It's the reason they're free. I still ate my because it was $7 for a burrito. Both my migos owe me $3.50 a piece. This place lacked flavor and and most importantly...fuck. #NeverAgain"}
{"text":"Very upset about this visit, mainly because I love Moe's and I always go to the Moe's location in Rocky River! So I tried the north Olmsted Moe's with high hopes it would be wonderful. Unfortunately it did not meet expectations, the quality just wasn't there... in any of the products. Every ingredient just was very low quality tasting, the lettuce was soggy, the chips were stale, the guacamole was horrid, and the ground beef made my boyfriend sick. This place wasn't even clean inside apart from the nasty food. By the salsa there were flies and I actually found a salsa cup in the hot salsa, How Disgusting! Never going back, I recommend anyone to take their business down Loraine rd to Moe's in Rocky River."}
{"text":"I prefer Moe's over the other chain Mexican fast food. I like salads, and Moe's offers a better quality item. I also like the free chips with your meal."}
{"text":"The food was OK, and the salsas were OK. The chips appear to be store bought. The real reason for the low rating though was it is filthy. I actually was looking for the health dept. rating...which I never found. We got there at 5:30 PM and the food looked like it had been sitting since lunch. Not a sole in the place...empty. Never been here and we had never heard of it, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was ok and the service was horrible. I love Moe's but if this was my first experience with the chain it would be my last."}
{"text":"Absolutely no flavor in any of the food. Tastes like it came out of a can AND no seasoning was added."}
{"text":"I went in on Friday night with my family....two children and wife.I was not eating so I went ahead to pay.Two  were having the Joe junior and a kids quesadilla.I noticed that the manner of engagement was more like barking. I was asked 3 times..... Queso on your chips???.....Queso on your chips???...I couldn't  figure  who he was addressing so I finally said no. Meantime as my son was ordering  he was asked about toppings and he said guacamole. ...immediately  invoking the ....these are Homewreckers shout out ...as if he was trying to pull a fast one. So as I payed Iaded two drinks  since the kids meal had a drink. They get their drinks and I realized  they  had charged for 4 drinks so I go back with a cup and asked for a refund. That's when the Manager tells me that I was charged correctly but he would  refund anyway. Being that had also tipped on the order I was caught off guard.  Just bad attitude and service....... Twilight  Zone .....and I did call and gave Him my opinion and filled out their survey online"}
{"text":"Terrible place. Service was awful and the food was no better. Ordered the overpriced veggie nacho platter. Was hungry so didn't mind paying airport prices  but expected to something edible. Not so. The salsa had gone off. The pinto beans were undercooked and the guacamole was brown. Top that off with chips that went doggy in thirty seconds and there you have a perfect airport meal - NOT!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Clean environment, friendly staff and fresh food! Always went to the Moe's in Stow and was happy to see one open in Mentor. You get generous portions of food too!"}
{"text":"\"WELCOME TO MOE's\" the staff yells as you enter the restaurant.   Moe's is my Monday tradition. My weekly weakness. It's the place where I indulge in my favorite California pastime: The consumption of GIANT burritos."}
{"text":"Pretty decent burritos at Moe's.  I agree with others that it's better than Chipotle.  Being vegetarian, I usually get the Art Vandalay.  Today I branched out and tried the tofu with a Triple Lindy.  The tofu is nothing special -- I'll stick with just beans next time.    Atmosphere is OK -- very crowded at lunch with lots of working folks.  But what is it with Fox News always on the TVs every single time I come in!?"}
{"text":"Great place, good Homewreckers, better than Chipotle. Too bad there aren't any in East Phoenix anymore."}
{"text":"I entered in for a free burrito so that's the reason I went here. It was okay but not a place I'd go back to frequently. I'd still choose chipotle over this place."}
{"text":"Was one of the first 75 people in line for the grand opening. Got a way cool lanyard that entiles me well actually my kid to 52 burritos one a week for the next year. Ordered the chicken burrito bowl. One thing I already like about Moe's is they do not charge for chips and salsa. They have the pop machines that allow kids to put 20 flavors in one cup. Pretty happy with my lunch tho my queso did not make it in the bag. Thanks and Welcome to Moe's."}
{"text":"fyi this is in a busy part of town where there's no public parking except a few blocks down, which is like 4.00 per hr.  You have five options when you go to Moe's Southwest Grill: Fajitas, Burritos, Quesadilla, Nachos or Tacos.   I stood there staring at the menu for 8 mins trying to figure out which one of these crappy options I wanna spend my money on.  I wasn't interested in any (but I went out of my way to go there, so I had to order something!).      Its a fast food setting. It's like Subway, all the fix'uns are sitting infront of you (lettuce, cheese, jalapenos, beans etc.) For the burritos, you pick what you want them to pile in the little basket, and you assemble the burritos at your table.  For each Burrito, you get 3 wraps.  The chicken was dry chunks sitting there in a little tub alongside the onions, mushrooms, and lettuce etc., waiting to be put with your meal.  It wasn't on a fresh skewer like those shawarma places or anything.  It was just sittin' there getting stale and cold.  I was like 'are you gonna heat that up?'  It was so wierd being served meat like that.  It is very expensive.  I got a burrito (3 wraps with the ingredients you put together at the table yourself), a quesadilla and a root beer, and that all cost me...$22.00.  Its costly and its not exactly hot, appetizing, or authentic Mexican.  I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Went to go have lunch there yesterday, and they were out of black beans!  Moe's should never be out of them, especially when there is a Target right by them. Go and buy some from them. That being said, I walked right out and went for more authentic Mexican food at Taxco."}
{"text":"My wife and I go almost every Monday to Moe's. There's 2 or 3 Moe's close to our house, but we only go to this one. Tony and his crew are the best! Always so welcoming and make you feel good to be eating there. If only every restaurant had employees as good as Tony and the rest of the folks... Love this place!"}
{"text":"I came into Moe's with pretty low expectations and was pleasantly surprised.  My salad was really fresh and I liked that they had some different topping choices, such as cucumbers, black olives and sauteed mushrooms.  (I'm used to Zabas or Chipotle that pretty much only offer salsa and some peppers). My steak was really tender -- juicy enough that I didn't even use any of my salad dressing.   The facilities were clean and there was plenty of comfortable seating.  I also thought the pricing was fair for the amount of food given.  The staff could have been a bit more friendly, but sadly that's pretty much the norm in Vegas.  I'll definitely head back to Moe's when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I love Moe's. So much better than Chipotle, IMO. I make the drive out here way more than I like to admit but it's just a great place to get a burrito. This place is different from the other chain burrito places in its array of options. Where Chipotle was going for a streamlined, simplistic menu, Moe's has come in with probably twice as many options. They have tofu, three kinds of grilled veggies (all cooked separately from animal-derived ingredients), rice, beans, guacamole, and a bunch of additional veggies to make the perfect creation.  They give a free order of chips with every order and they have a salsa bar with five or six different salsas at a time. Try the tomatillo, it's seriously the biggest reason I go to Moe's, it's that good. A lot of the other salsas are too sweet for me, but to each their own. Lastly, I rarely drink pop but they have a special Vanilla Peach drink on their Coke Freestyle machine.  I wouldn't reward Moe's with the title of best burrito, I think that belongs to either Ohio City Burrito or Taco Tonto's. But as far as the chain places, Moe's is tops."}
{"text":"Rice was undercooked, steak not seasoned, coca cola disgusting. Overall the food was all bad which is sad bc we've been to Moe's in some other states before and it was way better!!"}
{"text":"So, I was on my home to SFO from Las Vegas and got up really early to make my flight. On my way to my gate, I decided it was time to have breakfast. I passed up Burger King and a smoothie shop and came across Moe's. It looked like it was the choice at the time.   I ordered the special breakfast burrito with carne asada ($9.29) and was really disappointed. I should of opted for the smoothie."}
{"text":"Ordered the Vegetarian Burrito, no cheese or sour cream, added sautéed veggies and olives with tomatillo salsa. What I got was a flour tortilla filled with mushrooms, onions, peppers, and olives.... nothing else. They messed up on all of my co workers meals as well.  5 bags of chips and no sauces or salsa what so ever. When I called they told me I have to come back in to fix it, but before my at work I have no time and was told basically \"Oh Well! \""}
{"text":"Went here tonight to pick up a quick dinner for myself. It was a little busy, so I patiently waited in line. When I ordered my food, the people actually making my food were somewhat nice. But when I got to the register to pay, the girl working there was rude and clueless as to what was going on around her. I've been coming to this location for a while now and it seems like the customer service is just going downhill. I'll just go back to the Rock Hill location. I would rather drive further and be treated with respect than go here and deal with rude employees. I've worked in the restaurant business for 10+ years and there is no excuse for bad customer service. Even in quick order places like this. It's a shame."}
{"text":"They are reasonably priced, especially if you go on Mondays. But be prepared to wait in line or get there early. The reason for the 3 stars is the chips that was given to me had shiny coating of grease which was disgusting. If I am hungry enough I will be back."}
{"text":"Good food for a decent price.  It is comparable to Chipotle, but they have a few more options and I find the food to have more flavor.  There have been multiple times where I had ordered a soft taco and had to go back up to the counter to ask for a second tortilla, because they overstuffed the first one and it tore open.  Other than that, I have no complaints."}
{"text":"I was so pumped to have a Moes at this location. Cranberry is great but not this place. Rice is extremely dry. Steak has no flavor. Burrito was just dry and bland. 2 stars are for the queso. I'll stick to Chipotle or head to Cranberry."}
{"text":"Place was clean, staff friendly but the food was blah.  No flavor to components of steak burrito and completely cold to boot. Tried the \"hot\" smoky salsa, not even slightly spicy nor smoky.  Tried medium(of the two available the non chunky one) had the most flavor of anything I tasted but not enough help. Didn't finish the burrito because I was asking myself why I was continuing to eat when it was so dissapointing. Not worth the money spent.  Won't be returning here"}
{"text":"I would to use no stars but it will not allow me, so disgusting about this location, don't even know where to start.  Nasty manager having sex with employees just to keep their jobs, place nasty,  don't serve enough food long list, racist, discrimination, I have witness, young people who quit...thus place will be going down for their nasty behavior so ashamed of that place for its location  etc location 8133 Kensington Dr unit C , Waxhaw,  NC manager name Eric"}
{"text":"It's a good thing depression isn't contagious because the staff clearly wants to kill themselves. The ingredients as a whole were good, but the pico was more of a soup than anything like they were smashing all the tomatoes with the scoop.  The wrapper didn't mix the burrito ingredients around before wrapping it up so I was surprised to get a mouthful of jalapeños on my first bite. Worst part, no free chips. Expect to not eat there as seating is very limited. On the other hand, the wait to get my food was minimal. This could have easily been a 4-star review if the staff cared about their job and put a little more effort into making the entrees because most of the ingredients were good. I love Moe's, but recommend to stay away from this location until new management."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place. Inedible food that costs too much. Brown moldy Guac is extra!!! Who do they think they are... chipotle?"}
{"text":"I usually don't go this low when it comes to restaurant reviews, but this was probably one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a moes. I frequented moes weekly in another city before I came to this one.   I ordered a quesadilla. The preparation of my order started out fine, when it got to the second half where onions and cilantro would be added, another girl who was cleaning the warming station with a white cloth and gloves, stopped what she was doing and grabbed the onions with the hand she had just been cleaning with- glove and all. The girl who was originally preparing my food resumed and completed making the order.   I was utterly disgusted and completely turned off from eating here. The staff at this location clearly need a training in sanitation. It also appeared as if a supervisor wasn't on duty, just two young girls who appeared to be in high school.   I still recommend eating at moes, but be mindful at this location."}
{"text":"Moe's is very average food. There isn't anything that stands out and falls behind similar places-Qdoba, Chipotle etc.   The food was fresh and tasted alright, but was nothing special. The burritos are on the smaller end and has smaller portions inside the burrito.  My biggest problem was the value. There is NO way a burrito of that size with that little rice, beans, meat should cost over $7.50 for an original size. I've had bigger and better burritos that cost around $5. A small soda for $2.50 is also a bit much (free refills).  With each order you do get chips and salsa. I really liked the chips. Salsa was okay.  One other thing that baffled me. My wife ordered a Triple Lindy burrito in a bowl. You get this in a white box. When you try to throw it away, you can't fit the box in the trash can as the top is configured in a weird way. Good thinking.....  I was amused by the name of the Burritos-Homewrecker, Art Vandelay etc. Good stuff!  Moe's won't be high on list to go back to around Jobing.com for me. There are other places that are better.  2.5"}
{"text":"If you are uptown, grab a burrito. its cheap and filling."}
{"text":"I have been to over 10 Moe's across the US and this is by far the worst location (this includes the location in NYC Penn Station).  Burrito was very small, to say they skimped on ingredients would be an understatement. They have even managed to obstruct your view of the assembly line so don't see how little food you are actually getting. Additionally, the salsa renditions were not the same as other Moe's locations. The salsa they had tasted old."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Moe's. It is quick (especially if you use the phone app and order online ahead) and convenient and consistent.   I like the Joey (burrito), close talker (salad), and JC (quesadilla). I get them with chicken! Although I've done there tofu which is also fabulous.   Check out the salsa bar. And be sure to get some queso... ummmm queso. It's my favorite. As our their chips- thin, crunchy and not too salty.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"WELCOME TO MOES!!!!  It never fails...you will hear it loud and clear before your second foot even hits the floor upon entering!  Great things about THIS LOCATION:  Cleanliness  Well Stocked Salsa Bar  HEAPING portions when they make your stuff (I have been to other locations, trust me when I say they are NOT supposed to pile it on like they do at this location)  Willingness to make your dining experience perfect and beyond what their price-point is supposed to be.  Moe's at Ayrsley?  G-o-o-d T-i-m-e-s!!!!"}
{"text":"I was genuinely excited to see a Moe's at the airport. I had had it dozens of times before when I lived elsewhere and loved it but hadn't had it in years, so I thought \"Yay!\" Oh, my goodness. Flavorless, the rice was undercooked, they are incredibly expensive even for an airport, and they should start their staffing frm scratch. Not only was the young lady at the register unwelcoming, she did not give me the correct change for my payment and when I brought it up she gave me a look and said \"Yeah, yeah.\" before fixing it. Are you kidding me? Honey, I understand that maybe working fast food is not your ideal job or maybe you've had a bad day but come on."}
{"text":"Welcome to Moe's! A place where you get exactly what you expect (and deserve): quick service and tasty food at a reasonable price. As a bonus, there are plenty of add-on toppings to choose from, and when you order to go they load you up with an indigestible quantity of tortilla chips. The salsa bar is another strong point, where you can get as much as you like of eight dips - some regulars and others that rotate (this week I enjoyed the cucumber pineapple salsa)."}
{"text":"I come here weekly and never have trouble with the food. Typically what I get upset with are the customers. Slow and rude. Since I go there at least once a week, the employees always remember what I get. The only other thing I've had a problem with is the heat. During the summer it was very hot in the store. When I asked if there was something to be done about it, I was told that the employees had no control over the thermostat. It was locked by their boss. How awful. I can't even imagine how hot it was back with the grills."}
{"text":"This is seemingly the best (only?) option for vegans in the area.  It's not a vegan restaurant, of course, but there are a few vegetarian dishes that can be made vegan with the omission of cheese and sour cream.  The Art Vandelay burrito is cutely named, and is one such option.  The quality is average;  I would have enjoyed it more if it had been served hot.  The dining area was clean and larger than average."}
{"text":"This is our first (and last) AZ Moe's experience.  We lived 3 minutes from a Moe's in Ohio and always joked about the perpetual problems that NEVER got fixed.  Somehow, 2000 miles away, the problems are identical. 1.  Tofu is offered as a \"meat\" option but they were out of it.  The girl making the food didn't know where they kept the frozen tofu.  Same thing as Ohio. 2.  Certain vegetables not available.  \"I showed up today and NOBODY had done any prepwork!  Sorry!\"  Again, same thing as Ohio. 3.  One worker prepping food and ringing out on the register, and one worker rummaging around a freezer the entire 15 minutes they were in line (maybe looking for tofu?)  So, as the line lengthened with a Sunday lunch crowd, the poor girl became more and more frustrated.  (Yep, same as Ohio).  As I looked at my burrito sitting, getting cold, waiting for the girl to finish plating and ring it out, I just wanted to leap behind the counter and grab it.  We honestly do like Moe's food but there's some fundamental lack of management oversight to allow these problems to happen... over and over again."}
{"text":"Love love love Moe's! The employees are nice, they remember me when I come in and, at least one of them has nearly memorized what I order! They are considerate and kind."}
{"text":"I have to start this review by letting everyone know how excited I am that a Moe's opened in Las Vegas! I'm from the east coast where they have quite a few Moe's! I used to eat there faithfully. So when I found out about this particular opening, I was thrilled.   I have been ordering a to go lunch every single Saturday since it has opened! And have not once been disappointed by the food. I love the many options that you can pick from, nachos, bowls, burritos, salads, quesadillas, tacos and even something called a stack! I always end up ordering the vegetable band camp burrito bowl. I like the funky names for each option.   In my amazing band camp bowl, I always get extra rice, lots of grilled green peppers and onions, corn, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, pickled and fresh jalapeños (A+ for having both!) and the famous queso dip on the side! I tried a sample of the black and pinto beans! I think next time I order a veggie bowl, I will add pinto beans for something different!   I love that Moe's is so vegetarian and vegan friendly!!! Both pinto and black beans are vegetarian, they offer tofu for a little extra cost, and they use vegetarian cheeses and sour cream! The guacamole DOES NOT cost extra! :) They give you a free bag of chips too with your to go order and a variety of salsas are set out for you to take!   My experience this particular Saturday 11/01/14 was the best so far! The new girl starting the line was friendly and listened to what I wanted. The guy on the grille was explaining to me how they make a stacks order and kept all of the bins of veggie and meat options full. He was talkative and kind. The girl finishing the line was also friendly and I have seen her every Saturday along with the two boys at the end doing chips and cash register. I left with a smile on my face and I couldn't wait to get home and open my Moe's bag of goodness!   I had one unpleasant experience and one a step above that, but the food at Moe's makes me want to return! In the hopes that the gentleman with the huge bouncy hair isn't working the grille on Saturday. BOTH times he was there they were out of peppers and/or onions. I'm a patient person so it doesn't bother me that bad. What bothers me was coming in the line, letting the girl know I want extra peppers and onions when they are completely empty of peppers, her letting the guy on the grille know, and him still not making it 10 minutes later. He was just goofing off and yelling at the girls to be quite and he's making it \"blah blah\". I just stood there, waiting. Finally after about 15 minutes they had peppers to put on my bowl! Woohoo! Like I said....the food is yum.  All in all, I love you Moe's. I will see you every Saturday for our lunch date! :) And I will need to try this \"Stacks\" thing soon!"}
{"text":"During the St. Patty's Bar Crawl, they are charging to use the bathroom. Ridiculous. I realize it's crowded out here, but that, alone, should give you a prime reason not to give this place your business."}
{"text":"Terribly disappointed in this location. Moe's is one of my favorite fast food joints, but this one was so far below what I normally get at other locations that I was sorry I went there. The tables were dirty and the floor littered with trash. There was no tofu or grilled vegetables - I can get mushrooms, onions and peppers at other Moes. You have to ask for your chips or you don't get them and there no salsa bar - you just get one little container of the salsa they choose for you. I definitely will not be going back to this Moes!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with the cleanliness and service. When this Moe's first opened, there was a lot of excitement from customers, employees, and the franchisee. I liked Moe's very much, used to eat here once or more per week. Over the years, the quality and consistency has declined. I go maybe once per month or two now. Tonight might've been the last time. Walking in the door, no \"Welcome to Moe's\"! The kid Zak had an attitude, looked like he didn't want to be there. Bad service instantly sets a negative tone. Zak didn't look me or other customers in the eye, mumbled, forgot the black beans on my Funkmeister tacos, lazily put on toppings, which petered out by the last taco. I asked Zak directly for a side of guacamole, he walked away to help the next customer in line. I suppose sides just isn't his job. The young women working with Zak put chips in my bag and walked to the register, no guacamole. I asked her for my guacamole since she didn't ask, and Zak didn't tell her. I paid for my food, and I typically tip because I know these kids are cheap labor and can use the \"gas money\". The girl gave me my receipt and just walked away. Sorry, no tip for you!  Now, over to the salsa bar, my favorite part of Moe's, and it was a disgusting mess. There was salsa all over the handles of the spoons, salsa splattered everywhere (the counter, the glass, the stainless steel, and the floor), the green salsa and the corn and bean salsa bowls were both empty. At least one of the employees decided to try to sweep, but he was hovering around me and sweeping by my feet while I was standing at the salsa bar. What a disappointment. With Taco Bell opened across the street, the owners better get Moe's under control if they expect to stay in business. Moe's food is generally so much better than Taco Bell, but at least Taco Bell is consistent and clean, and their employees have so far been very friendly. I noticed very low ratings for several Moe's in the area. My hunch is that it's not the food, but the management of the stores, cutting corners, dirty stores, miserable employees, etc. So many fast food places around, it's easy to find someplace else to eat.  Improve the consistency and quality of the service and cleanliness, keep a stocked and clean salsa bar, set a welcoming and fun atmosphere with a \"Welcome to Moe's!\", and keep making good food and I'll be back with tips for the kids.  By the way, I don't want to see a response from Moe's saying \"That doesn't sound like the Moe's we know\", because it sounds exactly like the Moe's many in Waxhaw have come to know."}
{"text":"Pretty poor experience. When ordering burrito bowl running out of black beans so out like 6 on my bowl. When say something then get eye roll. Poorly staffed and managed for an $9 burrito bowl. Say stay away"}
{"text":"I've been excited to try your food since I saw you on under cover boss. What a bad experience in your store today.   What's the point of having an APP if your company doesn't use it. And then because they don't take the APP I not only have to pay more but don't even get points now?  I honestly expected more."}
{"text":"This particular location has the best service of any Pittsburgh locations. The staff is always willing to accommodate anything you ask for. The Joey with tofu is a phenomenal burrito and their salsa is addictive."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved that place!!!! Great service, friendly staff and most importantly  the food is so fresh!!! I loved that cheese deep they have with chips! My daughter and I  will be coming there a lot, even if we don't have a reason for shopping in the mall:)"}
{"text":"First off, their queso is outstanding...and they drown the chips if you get their nachos (which is good). I find their food is more consistent than Chipotle and Moe's generally has better quality meat.  The staff is always friendly and greets you as you enter. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'd love to give a higher rating, but this Moe's just doesn't cut it. My queso is usually cold and not runny at all. The service isn't that great. I keep going back though because I just love Moe's and this one is close. One day maybe I'll get it right."}
{"text":"Always love Moe's. This one is clean and courteous. A little expensive if you are thinking fast food but well worth the price."}
{"text":"The employees are friendly but the food itself is pretty bland. The meat and sauce is very unspiced and just doesn't taste Mexican at all. It doesn't even really taste like food actually, its just like chewing a flavorless stick of gum -- you know something is in your mouth, but it doesn't taste like anything at all. The only decent thing was the queso and chips, so you can try that if you absolutely must go here, but I would advise finding a better place if you want Mexican."}
{"text":"Went to grab a quick lunch.  I ordered a veggie burrito bowl with chips. They had very few vegetable options, i was little unhappy then but i was hoping it taste good. But when i tasted the  chipotle sauce with was bitter, Mexican rice was 50% cooked and the chips were uncooked. I literally had tough time chewing and had to trash my entire meal."}
{"text":"I love Moes. Not this Moes. Came for lunch, tofu hadn't even been made yet. It wasn't an early lunch. This happens a lot. Staff was chaotic. Only one person was working, the other two were standing around confused. I ordered the nachos and basically got charged full price for a mostly naked pile of chips with queso added as an after thought after my other toppings. Disappointed. Had I not paid, I'd have just eaten elsewhere but I couldn't bear arguing after waiting so long."}
{"text":"hmmm.... maybe lousy burritos and poor service are acceptable for billy goats and those kids in the feed the children commercials, but not for me. I'm not even sure where to begin with this place. I know i'll begin by saying go to the chili's near security check in. I am a guy who loves burritos and sir, that was a crappy burrito.  Flavorless meat, too much sour cream and guac; and oh yeah it was ICE COLD. Like fresh out of the fridge cold. This is a public service announcement: STAY AWAY....STAY AWAY.....STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"The food at this location is always amazing when I get a chance to make the drive out to Mentor for some Moe's. The staff is always friendly and greats each guest with the generic \"Welcome to Moe's\". Love the queso dip and the chips!   However my only negative that dropped my review to 3 stars is that the tables and floors smells like they were cleaned with a moldy rag/mop. The hand wipes at the straw table only took the smell of a dirty rag away a little bit. Get new rags or learn to clean them correctly and my review would have been a 5."}
{"text":"I've had moes a few times and finally had enough. The only reason I went a couple more times is to try different locations to see if anything changed. This is an absolute joke of a restaurant. It is more expensive than any other competitors (chipotle, qdoba, hot heads). They advertise free chips and salsa, which would be great if they were worth eating but don't waste the time getting the salsa because you'll end up getting a cup and dumping it on your unfinished food.The only thing that isn't bad about it is the queso. But put it on the burrito and it's still bad so yea. Then you have to hearths employees screaming \"welcome to Moes!\" every other bite of the gruesome food they serve. It doesn't matter what you get; if you get a stack, burrito, or quesadilla, everything is made with the same ingredients. Therefore, no matter what you get you're stuck with an extremely below average meal. Most overrated restaurant chain there is. If I can leave you with anything, pick chipotle and never go to this restaurant ever in your life."}
{"text":"Moe's knows!   Way more toppings then competing chains.  Plus, all the beans are veggie!"}
{"text":"Not going to stay open for long competing against Chipotle and Qdoba right down the street.  -Since the company \"gives\" chips with every order that means that in order to give the chips for free they need to cut back on food portions.  Well, the chips were terrible.  Comparable to cardboard with salt!  Much better chips available at other locations  -I ordered Guacamole in a container and the container was 1/3rd the size of one given at other establishments and cost more!!  And it had too much cilantro and tasted awful.  -Do these people skimp on meat oh my gosh!! They pile on cheese and beans and put little to no meat on the entrees.  While at the same time being more expensive then the competition.  Overall, very poor experience with the long waiting time and awful portions I'm going to stick to other places down the street. Moe's needs to up their game or else the company is gunna close for taking on industry leading companies."}
{"text":"Fast but gave me half scoops of everything I asked for. Every other moes loads you up but not this one"}
{"text":"The food was really good! The customer service was excellent. There were two males and a female working. They recommended a lot to us and we were happy with all the selections. Their Monday night deal was really great as well. Their lime sauce was awesome. I've been a chipotle fan for a long time but their ecoli issues moved us to Moe's. Everything was better than expected!"}
{"text":"I've been to other Moe's and they were a ton better.  First off, when you enter, you are to be greeted with a rowdy \"WELCOME TO MOE's!!!\", not the anemic and wimpy welcome to moes that one or maybe two people say.  Come on guys, give it some gusto!!  Secondly, the meat has no flavor.  We asked about this and they said they don't season any of their food so kids can enjoy it too.  Okay, cut back on the hot spices, but put something on it for goodness sake to give it a South Western taste.  Secondly, when I ask for Peppers and onions, I don't mean to place one slice of onion and one slice of pepper on my meal.  And when I ask for more, I don't mean just one more slice each.  Put a good sized serving on it.  At least when you go to the other two places, you get filled up.    I left here still hungry (that has never happened at the other two burrito places down the street).    Since I know that Moe's is good in other cities, I will give this a second try in a few months and hopefully by then they will have the kinks worked out and people who work there who can shout \"WELCOME TO MOE'S!!!\" and give a great experience with both great food and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Staff is so friendly and they greet everyone every time someone walks in. I cannot wait until the new store on rainbow and 215 opens,it will be closer to my house and i can go more frequently!"}
{"text":"1. The employees all seemed high 2. They were out of salsa 3. Whole place was a mess and not clean 4. AND THEY WERE FREAKING OUT OF VANILLA COKE!  For not being busy, this is unacceptable!"}
{"text":"I've been watching Moe's and waiting for them to open for weeks, and was sadly disappointed today. First I will agree that their service is spot on - attentive and helpful staff that was full of energy and made the ordering experience pleasant and quick. The restaurant was tidy and clean, and the salsa bar was a nice addition. When I arrived home and tasted my food I was not impressed. I ordered a chicken club quesadilla and was surprised that it was not toasted/heated, maybe I shouldn't have assumed and asked. I also ordered a burrito, so when my burrito was placed in the bag and I had to wait for them to bag the quesadilla, I made a stop over to the salsa bar to wait for them to finish the quesadilla, assuming it was being toasted. Not. It was bland and I ended up throwing it away. The burrito (Homewrecker) with seasoned ground beef was also a flop - no flavor. I did manage to enjoy the chips they included with my order. Considering that within a few blocks you can choose from Moes, Chipotle and Qdoba, personally I would cast Moe's last in the taste department. Service once again was great, awesome staff. Just with they had the food to match."}
{"text":"The guys that work in here made me want to be a happier person. And the Julia Gulia (ca classier healthier version of a crunch wrap supreme) just changed my life. Best 4th meal stop ever!!!"}
{"text":"Welcome to Moes !!! Is how they greet you. The staff is very alert making sure all guest are greeted. They are really nice and make me feel very comfortable. I have been in here a couple of times and it seems like the food gets better and better each time I come. Don't get it wrong they food is always good, I just get more addicted each time I come. They have the best queso and guacamole."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Moe's Southwest grill from the service to the food to even the environment. The staff was so welcoming and helpful since it was my first time. I got a salad with grilled chicken and it was delicious and also very fresh. The restaurant itself was so clean and had a very nice ambience. Definitely one of my new spots to go to!"}
{"text":"Closed indefinitely. Other location on 6910 S. Rainbow Blvd. Suite 100 was closed in June 2015. Only one location left here in Las Vegas at Concourse A inside McCarran airport."}
{"text":"I love Moe's!  You can always count on the quantity and quality to stay consistant...except...at this location.  What gives?  I always feel shorted with the chips and the food is always under-seasoned."}
{"text":"ROTC helps more then employees...food is fair butcomes down to people who dont seem to want to be there"}
{"text":"Totally agree-step above Taco Bell and below chipotle. Service was good and portions big but absolute bland. No flavor at all. I had a bowl with chicken and usual toppings and it was in dire need of something.  Chips on the side are nice.  Wish there were some descriptions  of the salsas and named items-and flavor!!!"}
{"text":"The past couple times I've eaten at moes, the green peppers were undercooked, and the chips were under seasoned"}
{"text":"This is a great concept. The food here is tasty. A LITTLE on the pricey side for a taco, but who cares? The staff is friendly and efficient. It's a great place to go for lunch.   Not to mention they have one of those coke machines that gives you pretty much any flavor you can think of!!   Moe's rocks!"}
{"text":"Delicious burritos, burrito bowls, tacos, salsa bar, friendly employees, quick service. Food is way better (and healthier) than the average fast/sitdown food. Would highly recommend Moe's and the Concord  NC location specifically!"}
{"text":"I am 15 year old teenager who wanted to go into Moes to grab a bite to eat. As soon as I came in, the manager of this particular store told me and I quote \"No, get out. Either you eat or get out!\" I was so shaken back by this man's tone of voice that I said back to him \"I am getting something to eat\" He smirked and continued onto serving customers. I sat down then got up to order my food. I got nachos with chicken and cheese which was 8.21. that seemed a bit pricy to me. I didn't really mind but I was still thinking that he told the lady to hike up the price. When I tried to talk to the manager, he was no where to be found. After looking for him, I asked an employee his name. His name is Eric. so I sat back down and ate with my friends. After eating, my friends and I left the store and we're talking about out bad experience outside. we say the manager Eric come back into the restaurant as soon as we left and talk to his employees and laugh and look at us. I stared at him and I was extremely uncomfotable.  this is not the only bad instance we have had with this manager. other people I know have had extremely bad things happen to them.  if you can please call me ASAP because I would this man to be held accountable for his actions."}
{"text":"The rice in my burrito was too hard, ingredients were not lower quality than other mexican restaurants competing in the same market place.    My burrito seemed thrown together hastfully.    There are better options..."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch for some tacos. Never been to Moe's before, and looked at an online menu prior to ordering. It was nice to know I could mix up the types of shells I wanted as well as the protein, provided they were in the same price category (chicken+beef). You walk in and state what you want and you build it as needed with all the toppings laid out. What is really counter-productive is telling the first person you see the name of the item you want. You would figure simply saying \"overachiever tacos with no guacamole\" would click with them to know what should already go on it, right? No. All it came down to was trying to figure out what to put on my three tacos, which just complicates things if I can do different things for each taco and feel rushed while I do it.   Needless to say, my overachiever actually wasn't the overachiever because no beans were on it. I LOVE black beans, and was bummed they weren't on there. Yeah, i could have said to put them on, but my oversight was thinking that saying WHAT WAS ON THE MENU implied that by default I would get the stated toppings. Whatever, clearly the ordering is confusing.   So that's that. I got 2 soft tacos with beef and chicken, and then a crunchy taco with beef. And then whatever odd toppings I picked at random because no one memorizes what goes with a menu item. Free chips and salsas is a plus, and I decided to get a cup of queso, along with sides of green, mango hananero, and some medium chunky salsa, whatever its name was.   I live a few minutes down the street and by the time I got home and promptly started eating I discovered that the crunchy taco does NOT hold up well. With some tomato, sour cream, lettuce and cheese 95% of the shell was soft and falling apart as I ate it. No bueno.   Alot of people saying Moe's items are bland, and I can agree with that when I comes to the chicken. It was just ok with the same toppings I had above. But, I was glad to see that they serve some pretty appealing beef, and not the cheap dogshit they concoct at Taco Bell or cheap Mexican restaurants. The beef actually is beef and has some decent flavor and texture. . I noticed a southwest rice that was also pretty good and went well the the beef and said toppings.   Again, free chips are nice, but with the amount they give you it's pretty pointless to get a cup of queso. The side of queso seems more appropriate since you don't get much. Getting the cup is a waste of  the 3 or 4$, because your small portions of chips don't really make the value worth it if you have ALOT of leftover queso. The salsas were ok, did not care the overly sweet mango habanero salsa though.   They REALLY need separate chip bags because its a pain in the ass fishing out my 3 tacos underneath chips just carelessly thrown into the bag. WHY do that?!  The only good part is you get more options and variety to go with mediocrity. The tacos pretty much are on par with the taco kits you buy and make yourself a home from Giant Eagle.  Moe's isn't bad to stay away from, but it isn't the best to come to daily. I wouldn't mind stopping back for a bowl in the future."}
{"text":"Attitude behind the counter. No crisp taco shells, no ice, food cold, no towels in bathroom, order screwed up. Didn't enjoy it at all."}
{"text":"Waited in line for 20 minutes for an overpriced taco combo meal. When I ordered I was told by the server they don't do combos despite their sign advertising this. After explaining that they do in fact do I eventually got my food, and received a tiny beef taco and my drink for the grand price of $12.52. Had to then ask for the side which they forgot to include. Pretty ordinary, overpriced airport food and employees who don't even know what their menu items are. Give this one a miss."}
{"text":"While getting our food, the manager was really terse and slightly rude in tone with customers. I ordered the chili queso not knowing it had meat in it, and when I asked to exchange it for regular cheese, they made me purchase a whole new one when the signage was not clear and it was evident that I got a vegetarian meal. Bad customer service and messy bathrooms. Well, I shouldn't say \"bad customer service.\" The employees were very kind and even apologized for the manager's \"agitated\" behavior, but I thought the way the manager was so condescending with some people, particularly people of color and women, was entirely uncalled for. If it had been my daughter some manager had talked to the way he talked to the girl and mother in front of me, I would have called corporate."}
{"text":"After being contacted by someone at Moe's who was not happy with my review (and didn't seem to comprehend it either) I agreed to disagree and decided to just let it sit.  Today, however, I took a closer look at my Yelp messages and noticed something interesting.  My first message was from a yelp user named John J., however, it was signed by Alisha, the Moe's supervisor!  Okay, she's using an alias. I guess that's fine. But what happens when you click on her/John J.'s reviews???  http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=jw2HaZgWb3eVktJuVX4PyA  What???  Just in case she/John J. deletes their reviews (which they most certainly will), I'll sum them up below.  Moe's Southwest Grill (6910 S. Rainbow)  5 STARS  Moe's Southwest Grill (W. Maule Ave)  5 STARS  Moe's Southwest Grill (10965 Lavender Hill)  5 STARS  Seems a little biased to review a company you work for Alisha/John.....  But wait, there's MORE!  Cafe Rio (4830 Blue Diamond)  2 STARS - \"Was not happy! Waited 20 minutes for a quesadilla, A joke... I have discovered a new concept from the East Coast down the street. Moe's Southwest Grill. It was great. Quick service- I had a Billy Barrou! It was really good. I have found my new lunch spot.\"  Pieology Pizzeria (10965 Lavender Hill) --- Right Next Door To Moe's  2 STARS - \"We stopped in when my son decided that he wanted a pizza instead of a burrito. We were all outside eating our meal and he refused to eat. I thought he was just being picky until I tried it. The crust tasted old and burnt, the toppings were dry and the marinara sauce taste bad. The weather was nice outside, and that is the only reason I gave it two stars.\"  Seriously? So you make up positive reviews about the 3 Moe's in town and then you trash your competitors? Seems like bad business Alisha/John!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great prices, and a high tech drink machine! And they say WELCOME TO MOES!! Every time you come in! They have cool names for each of their products! They have cookies that have a nutrition label! Awesome burritos! Excellent service! Lots and lots of condiments!  TVs! And last but not least THE BEST QUESO IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Started off not knowing what I wanted. Workers weren't very helpful in offering suggestions and just stared at me like I was stupid. I decided to get a chicken bowl. Again, the servers weren't very pleasant while I was ordering. The bowl it's self was very disappointing. The rice was actually so undercooked and hard that I took it back to exchange for a quesadilla. The cashier kept trying to offer me another bowl instead, but I didn't want anything with rice. I offered to pay the difference, but she said she would ask the manager if it was possible. The manager/supervisor was very pleasant and offered right away to exchange it for me. The quesadilla was delicious! Going forward, I think I'll just stick with Chipotle."}
{"text":"I am not impressed with this Moe's restaurant!! There was old food dripped around the edges of the food bar, and I saw the employees push the old food back into the fresh food instead of cleaning it up and throwing it away. The salsa bar is also never full and rarely clean. The management needs to get a handle on this restaurant! I understand it is fairly new, but the employees and managers really could do a better job maintaining cleanliness. I live in fort mill and I pass by this Moe's to go to the Rock Hill location because the food is fresher and the staff is more organized and friendlier. I was really excited for the Fort Mill Moe's to open, but I do not want to spend anymore money there until the service picks up. They're are a lot of great Mexican restaurants in Fort Mill and Moe's has a lot to compete with. I love Moe's so I really hope this location steps their game up!"}
{"text":"This is just a crappy Moe's. However, if you like to eat each individual ingredient in an individual section of a poorly wrapped burrito, though, this is the place for you.   Inconsistent serving sizes (I ended up with about five pieces of steak on my whole burrito), poor customer service, sometimes lukewarm food...skip this. There's a Chipotle across the street and a Salsarita's down the road."}
{"text":"The food at this location was just so so. I will be giving it another try at some point if they do not go under."}
{"text":"Keep striking out lately...:-( maybe it's a sign to stop eating out. So, my burrito was fine. But my husband ordered the home wrecker with steak and got chicken! Even the foil had a big \"S\" on it for steak. Then, we got crumbs for chips...now, for those of you seasoned Moe's goers, know you usually get a heaping scoop of tortilla chips with your burrito that you can never finish anyway...but not today! I actually still had queso to spare, and that was the 2oz side! I know you can see and directly talk to the guys or gals behind the glass as they roll up your one pounder burrito, and my hubby should have said something, but didn't. I just told him to \"eat it anyway...chicken is better for ya anyway\". So he did. But the bottom of the barrel chips? Come on! I have been striking out with eating out for like a month straight here!"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying the queso.....mmmmm! One could possibly just drink it right from the cup. I also enjoy it when the staff serenades you when you walk in the door and when you leave a tip :-). I enjoy the Art Vandalay. It's full of veggies. There is a new spicy guacamole they just introduced and it's pretty good. They also cater, which would be a lot of fun for those summer fiestas you wanna have!"}
{"text":"Homewrecked  baby, love this place, the food so fresh the chips so toasty, clean place, nice family gathering option. If you like Mexican style food this is for you."}
{"text":"Walking in behind manager on Monday she pretty much almost pulled the door closed to make point she wasn't going to hold it open. My wife a I decided to walk out and she then could be heard saying stuff inside after we left. Obviously has a problem with people different from her race. Will never go back again!!!"}
{"text":"3rd and last time here. Service is horrible and slow. By the time they finally get to ringing me up, my food is cold. Not going back. Saw the cashier touching chips with no gloves on."}
{"text":"Lunch now is cutting down on chips. Handly enough for the small side of queso. Burrito is still solid"}
{"text":"The location at Downtown Summerlin could use assistance in training employees. There were three employees present at lunchtime and neither of the employees could complete the task without seeking the help of another person. The staff person that assisted me could not speak up and was hard to hear. She was very tentative and lacked the confidence to take care of customers as she was new to her job and needed more training before she waited in customers. Food prepared was not hot and mediocre presentation and quality. This location needs more training of entire staff."}
{"text":"I thought that the burritos here are ok, but nothing special. Not too similar to Chipotle in my opinion, except for that they both serve the same type of food. The chicken quesadilla is by far the best thing on the menu, but other than that I have nothing to add to the previous review."}
{"text":"Wow. Haven't been to any place with such  unhappy employees. Everyone had a terrible attitude. They forgot to put guacamole on my order;  when I asked for some, it was a huge hassel. They acted like I was crazy and trying to steal.  Given there is a Chipotle and Qdoba in the area,  there is no reason to visit again.   This was my third and last visit."}
{"text":"I use to be so excited about Moe's Monday, but this location week after week rolls you the smallest burritos on Monday. One week I counted the bites and it was 6 reasonable bites and the burrito was gone, can you call it a deal if it's $1 per bite? This location takes advantage of the fact that UNCC keeps it busy."}
{"text":"Moe's is awesome and has been my favorite place for burritos for years! Salsas are good, filling options are varied, and their queso is good. And free chips!"}
{"text":"I know a lot of people that rave about Moe's so I figured that I would try it out and see what the rave is.  Unfortunately I was not impressed.  The food was cold and was not fresh.  The food seemed like it had been cooked a long time before it was served to me and my wife.  When the food was not fresh it made the bill that much harder to swallow (23.00 for two people).  We ended up trashing the food and heading on over to Mellow Mushroom."}
{"text":"I adore Moe's. I love the fact that you get free chips & salsa with every purchase. Sometimes I just buy 1 taco and with the chips & salsa, that makes a meal. The Art Vandelay vegetarian burrito is recommended.  They close early. So after work I'd have to rush over to grab a burrito before they closed up shop."}
{"text":"I love the options of add on ingredients. It makes me feel like I'm making healthier decisions while still devouring a ton cheese. The staff is friendly and the place is always clean."}
{"text":"If you work hard and you are really hungry don't go to this place, for over 10 bucks you will get much more in some other places, half spoon serve, over price burritos and nachos."}
{"text":"not sure if it is the same place or not. we went to moe's in ROBINSON TWP today. i was pretty let down.  first of all, it is SO FREAKIN' LOUD in there! the music is blaring and there are no baffles on the ceiling to control noise. it was hard to hear the person at the same table.  next, it is nothing more than an imitation of Chipotle. not impressed with the food in any special way.  when you come in , the employees behind the food bar and counter yell \"Welcome to Moe's\". um... not sure there is a point to this. and , it got annoying really quick for someone eating in.  yes, greet people at the food line. yes, be friendly but i don't agree with the yelling. not clever.  the parking is lousy. i would not go out of my way... or in my way , to go there again. would DEFINITELY choose elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place was ok.  My group ate here for lunch.  There wasn't a clean table.  No napkins or forks.  No hot salsa.  They were stingy on the chips.  Their black beans were sub par in the flavor dept. I would have rather just had Chipotle."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, queso.............  I could end my review there and that would be sufficient in my eyes!  Anyways, came here today for a quick lunch (Joey Jr) and it was free queso day! The junior was delish as normal. Moes always seems to serve a consistent product and the free chips and salsa just add to its greatness!  The only two comments I have about this particular Moes is: 1. The bottleneck. Anyone that has been in here knows that the drink machine/salsa area is just an accident waiting to happen... 2. I dont usually add a ton of things to my burrito (for example on this particular occasion it was rice, black beans, chicken, corn, and lettuce). The guy ripped the shell....no biggie at all. However, instead of replacing the tortilla, he just re-wrapped it with a new one (aka now I had two tortilla shells instead of one). Since I was about to eat my body weight in chips and queso, I really only needed one tortilla. Thus, I made a huge mess at my desk trying to unwrap one and eat the burrito that had the ripped shell. Eventually, I just dumped it in a bowl and gave up. Not really a deal breaker but, since it was fairly slow when I went in, he definitely just could have just removed the ripped tortilla!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, and the food isn't much better. On a Tuesday night I waited over 23 minutes before walking out and refusing to pay for my order. I was the third person in line and that was enough to put 5 people behind the counter so far in the weeds they couldn't see the light of day."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 2 stars: 1 for the friendly staff and 1 for the amazing salsa.  Unfortunately, all the other food is bland. Nothing to write home about. You can add things up when you realize it's a pretty big place and yet there were only ever 2-3 tables filled... as compared to Lindo Michocan or Café Rio which are always packed.  The part where they really shine is their \"seasonal salsas\" for their chips... These are literally the best salsas I've ever tasted in my life and I'm a sauce/salsa fiend... I've probably had 100 different sauces and salsas... whether it be restaurant exclusive or store bought... best salsa EVER... it's called the \"Who Is Kaiser\" salsa and \"El Guapo\" salsa -- plus they'll give you as many chips as you want.  2nd runner up would be Don Tortaco... who seriously stepped their game up by adding home made fire roasted red salsa to their take-away section  This place bills itself as a Tex-Mex place... but I didn't taste that... and I've had much better Tex-Mex.  I will return for the salsa only."}
{"text":"This specific Moe's had terrible customer service. They only give you literally a small amount of everything and when I went to ask for more chips most of them were stale. And after sitting down to eat, I realized the food wasn't fresh. I don't know if there's anything good to say about this Moe's."}
{"text":"While in North Olmstead looking for a place to grab a quick bite without going to the usual fast food. I came across Moe's and decided to give it a try.  It's pretty much the same as Chipotle, where you decide burrito, taco, salad, etc. Then you choose your meat and sides. There are a plethora of sides to choose from...salsas, hot sauces, jalepenos, tomatoes, sour cream, cheese, guacamole, etc. And guess what...the guacamole is a free side choice!  Take that Chipotle!!!  I ordered two chicken tacos (flour tortillas) with sour cream, guacamole, cheese and hot sauce. They are not cheap with any of the sides (including the chicken), the tacos were pretty big and very fresh.  They also give you a free side of tortilla chips.  What makes this even better is that off to the side, they have a salsa bar with about 6 different salsas. I tried three of them: Pineapple-Cucumber has a very strong pineapple flavor with a small bite. The sweet of the fruit mixed well with the very, very slight spice. El Guapo - traditional medium salsa (although I felt it as more of a mild, didn't taste any heat) and the Roasted Jalapeño Garlic Salsa, advertised as high heat keeping the timid away, but it was more of a medium spice.  All ingredients are fresh and everything tasted very good.    Chipotle definitely has competition in my book!"}
{"text":"I like Moe's. This location has some of the nicest employees I have ever seen and the food is usually pretty good. I love the burritos and the bowls. They finally have a couple of good salsa options. The drink machine is the bomb - only place I drink a vanilla coke!   BUT there is a problem: I had dinner with a friend here and the constant 'WELCOME TO MOE'S' was just too much. I don't usually mind it but during the dinner hours when someone is always coming thru the door - it is annoying and way too loud! I could not carry on a conversation with my friend so the meal was not very enjoyable."}
{"text":"The restaurant is dirty, staff is not friendly, stingy with ingredients, seemed like we paid a lot for a little bit of food."}
{"text":"I grew up in Atlanta and Moe's is great there. This one is terrible. I tried repeatedly to make it work. I've gotten hard rice like others complain about on here, they've been out of guacamole and other items, and today the most disgusting thing of all happened.  I went in about 1pm on Friday Nov 6. The person behind the counter walked to the back when I arrived. Someone else was sweeping the floor.  She came over carrying the broom and dust pan, brought them back to the kitchen and put gloves on without washing hands.  I walked.  I understand that all restaurants have some level of uncleanliness. If someone isn't going to bother to follow the most basic health code of washing hands after handling garbage right in front of a customer, what other corners are they cutting?   I made a complaint a few months ago. An account here contacted me as the franchisee. I was actually going to PM them this story until I discovered that they were abusing their account.   They left a glowing review of their Moe's and negative ones about three competitors in their shopping center, including a competing Mexican restaurant.  The other negative reviews are about Pieology (its next door neighbor) and Shake Shack.   http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=jw2HaZgWb3eVktJuVX4PyA  I took a screenshot of them and contacted each business and Downtown Summerlin to show them what their competitor/tenant was doing. I also contacted the Moe's corporate office.  That is as sleazy as it gets. I will not be giving the Las Vegas locations, apparently owned all by the same group, any business. I will be happy to visit the ones in Atlanta.  Edit: I contacted Yelp about this user and establishment and they removed several of his reviews, including his positive Moe's ones and the negative ones about competitors."}
{"text":"Pretty basic build a burrito place. Good food. Seemed fresh. Pretty clean unlike similar places. Staff was pretty laid back and very patient. I recommend this place if you need a quick lunch that is a step up from basic fast food. The place was freezing through."}
{"text":"I didn't have high hopes as the reviews were not good but decided to look in as I was in the area. I was very pleasantly surprised!  The young lady who helped me grilled fresh onions and peppers for me sans oil and accommodated all my requests no problem. She was friendly, the food was good and the place was very clean. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Since your Mexican food competitor across the street's foodborne illness outbreak, I decided to go to Moe's for lunch.  I wasn't surprised that there was a huge line after the \"lunch rush\" hour.  Anyways, I ordered a Personal Trainer salad.  As you can see by this picture, the QUALITY of the ingredients, specifically the lettuce, was unacceptable and the salad unable to be eaten.  As a result, I threw the salad away and wasted ~$7.  I am not talking about one or two leaves of lettuce here, the entire portion of lettuce was either black, slimy, past the \"use-by\" date and inedible.  I ordered the salad to-go and ate at my desk for lunch so it wasn't even like I could go back and ask for a new one."}
{"text":"As a loyal Chipotle fan I will say the customer service at Moe's was great during my recent visit. Several employees seemed to be new and in training but no major issues from it. The manager who was the cashier was over the top helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm ok that no one shouted \"welcome to Moe's!\" when we walked in.  I can do without that. But the service dropped from there on. While Kevin was making my dinner, he stopped to replace the beans. And then took a phone call. He never came back. Just stood there talking, and looking at me. A while later, another employee came to finish it up. I had to wait for a little while to ask another employee for a fork, as they were all out. \"Huh?!\" was the answer I received. I think the appropriate response is \"excuse me?\" when you don't understand someone. The highlight for us is usually the Coke Freestyle machine. It was out of ice. And out of Coke. And Dr Pepper, and about any other non-diet drink.  And as we were leaving and went to clear our table, the trash can was overflowing.  We won't be coming back here. Bummer, since it's close by."}
{"text":"Mo-Mondays is what I mostly hit Moe's for but have been known to go other days too :). The rice bowls are really good and the portions are pretty equal to the price. Over all it is a real good place for a quick lunch and it is real close to my work so that's an added plus for me."}
{"text":"I heard great things about Moe's from my friends on the East Coast, so I decided to try it for lunch.   It's pushed all the way at the edge of Downtown Summerlin. The location is large. It's a little dark and the trays were very sticky, but it was about what you would expect.   I got a chicken burrito with lettuce, rice, and jalapeños. I enjoyed the option of having fresh jalapeños, and it added just the right amount of heat. They serve tortilla chips with it, which is a nice touch.   The salsa bar was a great option. I wish they had a spicier tomatillo, but I found that I actually enjoyed my burrito more without the salsa -- surprising for me.  Overall, I would definitely come back. It's about on the level of Chipotle for me."}
{"text":"The service was alright. I came in really hungry, so the Joey bag tasted fantastic. It was the middle of the day and I probably shouldn't have trusted the salsa bar but I do think they have respectable salsa. I'm glad they stopped saying welcome to moe's."}
{"text":"Last night as I rode in on 215 from California, I saw a big sign for the new Moe's Southwest grill. My husband and I were very hungry and we said let's try that new place in Downtown Summerlin. I got food for four people and all of it I wouldn't feed to the pigs in North Las Vegas. It was literally slop. I ordered the Nachos and the girl kept pouring cold queso sauce over it. My husband ordered the burrito and it tasted as if the chicken was burnt. I think Cafe Rio and Rubios is way better and even Taco Bell. It was also very expensive. $45 for four items. Their chips were also sub-standard."}
{"text":"Terrible. Been here twice and they were out of something on the menu both times. Considering how small the menu is that's quite an accomplishment. Food is not bad, but it's simply not good either. Nothing has a pleasant taste."}
{"text":"Did not like this place i thought it was going to be a lot better. Should of know better since there was no one in there food tasted bland flavorless sorry to say this but I'm not coming here agin"}
{"text":"I had read about Moe's here on Yelp.  So I thought I would stop by and have a meal.  I drove by Kyrene and Elliot and couldn't find the place.    After looking a little closer there was an empty storefront where Moe's was supposed to be.    RIP Moe.  You probably won't be missed because there are plenty of other really good southwest grill places to eat, and apparently you didn't stand out.  Maybe Larry or Curly will do better."}
{"text":"Only 3 stars because I just feel like the food isn't always super fresh. The rice is very hit or miss. They also always break my burrito when rolling it or they unevenly out the ingredients in which means I get an entire bite of just cheese.   There's usually a line during lunch Monday-Friday."}
{"text":"Wow i am really surprised at all the bad reviews! I live at the airport and i can tell you this is one of the  best places you will find in an airport anywhere.  It is a little high on the price but, so is all food at the airport except Philly because, they  have street prices.  The food is excellent and always very fresh! You have so many choices on what you  want to have on your burrito. You just cannot complain at all.    Everyone seems cranky when they are at the airport and throwing out the hate vibes. Everyone really needs to stop it. Be happy, be thankful for everything and everyone around you. I like this place i think it is really good just,expensive."}
{"text":"This was at gate 15. If it wasn't for the worker being rude I would have tried this place out. This was around 9:30am, I asked a simple question to see if they can make nachos and she said \"breakfast only\" not only was she rude she shook her head and rolled her eyes at me. If it wasn't for her doing that I would have ordered something from the breakfast menu. A simple question doesn't mean you have to be so rude about it."}
{"text":"WARNING! NOT ALLERGY FRIENDLY.   Specifically asked for corn, was given flour.  Asked to be cautious, they could not give a flying Care.  Spoke to manager, got money back with attitude.   Will never be back.   They need to fire the entire crew and re-train."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nothing special, the food tasted like warmed up leftovers. My daughter found a hair in her burrito and I paid $35.00 for basically a terrible experience. We had so much food leftover that stayed right there in the restaurant because we weren't taking that garbage home.  I suggest a whole revamping of this restaurant and for the doors to be shut immediately. Yuck with a side of yuck."}
{"text":"Wow! I am giving this a 5 star rating because the service was impeccable!  This location offered up free orders today from 11-2pm and I was quite impressed with the friendliness and quickness of their staff. Usually restaurants don't run flawlessly like this the first week they are open let alone the first (or second) day! My wait was only about 10 minutes and I was greeted at the door by someone greeting me and handing me a to go menu (great marketing!). He was explaining the menu as well as the fact that they do catering. The next person I reached was asking if you wanted to sign up for text alerts (again great PR and Marketing). Then came the ordering. Wow are these employees on point. Not only were they fast but they were accurate! They had a great system and you could tell they were trained well! Everyone also seemed to be in a great mood!   I ordered the Wrong Doug Stack with Chicken (think crunchwrap supreme but with much better ingredients). You get a choice of all different kinds of salsas to add to it as well as the option of black beans, queso, and sauteed peppers and onions. You also get chips with every order and can get as much salsa as you would like from their salsa bar!   Welcome to Rocky River Moe's!"}
{"text":"Will never go to this location again.  This restaurant is always dirty but yesterday it was exceptionally bad.  There was water all over the floor, the beverage station was a disaster, they were out of tea and once made, they didn't add sugar to the sweetened, tables were dirty and trash was overflowing.  The cashier had no idea how the rewards program worked. To make matters worse, our quesadilla had mold in several spots on it.  Returned it and they made us another one and gave us $10 Moe's cash.  We have never seen anyone there that appears to be management but they definitely need someone supervising the staff.  Will go to Rock Hill from now on. It is so much better."}
{"text":"This store has the worst service. My wife went to pick our food up recently and no one told her that Moes decided to change their incredible chicken over to awful chicken (dark meat) and she got all the way home just for neither of us to eat our dinners. I will definitely not be returning to Moes anytime soon. Chipotle it is!"}
{"text":"Not impressed -.food is way overpriced for what you get. Ordered 2 tacos and nachos and made one of them a meal...with a military discount only on one item the bill was over $15.  As soon as we sat down to eat our tacos, they were already completely soggy and way too greasy.   The nachos were not any better, all the food was very bland as well.  We inquired about the rewards program, and the cashier didn't even know how it worked.  If I had a choice between here and Taco Bell for a fast food stop, I would take Taco Bell. The best bang for your buck is Taco Local in Willoughby, priced the same , made with organic foods and larger portions for the same money."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Moe's since I live in the neighborhood. It's a casual, quick place to grab lunch or dinner. You order over the counter and follow your food down the \"assembly line\" as they build and top it for you.   I usually get the Tofu Close Talker salad sans fried shell. They have fresh toppings such as marinated mushrooms, jalepenos, grilled onions and peppers, and black olives. They have daily deals and the prices are great.   There is a self-serve salsa bar with about six different salsas. The line can get long during peak lunch and dinner times and especially on kids' night. The cleanliness of the place is a hit-or-miss because the tables can get pretty dirty.  All-in-all its an awesome place to grab a quick bite. Everyone in the neighborhood seems to be a regular here and the staff remembers you after you've gone a couple times which makes it intimate."}
{"text":"The worst moe's ever. Rice was burnt and it permeated through the whole rice bowl. Service wasn't stellar and even some of the staff looked like they didn't care to be there - and it wasn't even 1pm! Wouldn't have even served the burnt rice to anybody. Unfortunately it probably should have been thrown out. It basically ruined the entire bowl. I did what I could to pick out the chicken and beans. In the words of the father eating Nacho Libre's cooking, \"This is the worst meal I have ever had.\" I just hope I won't have \"diarrheas since Easters.\""}
{"text":"So I chose this place last minute b/cry family was going to pieology and I didn't want you pizza. I order a joey jr & the burrito was so big it broke the tortilla. The burrito maker grabbed another tortilla and wrapped it on top. The cashier ask the burrito maker \"this is a joey jr?\" Burrito maker says \"yes\" and the cashier goes on to charge me a regular size burrito. I reassure him that I ordered a jr and he get his manager to refund the difference. The manager seemed to not know what she was doing as 3 new customers came in before I received my refund. Moral of the story is, don't be upset at your customers for your employees mistakes!! Especially when the food is mediocre!"}
{"text":"Its good... Id prefer El Campesino or Chipotle... Found a fly in my food, don't have the stomach to go back."}
{"text":"I've gone to this place a million times but today was just bad. I always order a home wrecker junior with chicken, but taking one look at ALL the meat choices today I opted for none. All the meat was dry and obviously over cooked. It just looked gross. And the two girls working behind the counter acted like they didn't even care they had jobs!! The girl that made my burrito didn't even take her gloves off or change them when she rang me up or took my money. Wonder how long she'd had them on? Gross....there must be a new manager or something because this place has gone waaaaay downhill. I won't be back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and i decided to go to the Washington Pike Moe's today to grab some food. I must say, this has probably been one of the most disappointing restaurant experiences of my life. We walked up to hot and were addressed as if we were a nuisance. My girlfriend asked if they had the spicy chicken, to which he gave a sharp, short no. great start already. He rushed us along, haphazardly throwing our food in a bowl and carted us off to the next employee. The employee working cold was very pleasant though and graciously helped us. Then we got to cash. She was again short, rude and just pushed us along. There was no one else behind us in line, so there was no need to throughput us as quickly and callously as they did. The food was the only things that saved our restaurant experience. All in all, i will not bring my business back to this location."}
{"text":"This location IS slammed at lunchtime!   This was my friend \"Danny B's\" pick on this month's lunch time adventure.   We arrived promptly at 11:30 AM and there was only two people in line!  But listen up people by 11:40 the line swelled twice the size!!    After getting our food we chose a high table by the window - overlooking Market Square - in order to people watch.  There's plenty of outdoor patio seating available - in the event the indoor dining would fill up.   I had the \"Wrong Doug\" steak packed with black beans, cheese, quac, salsa, lettuce.   I usually get the salad or taco .. wanted to try something different.  The Wrong Doug is packed with goodness and grilled on both sides and served warm..  it was delicious but too big for me..I couldn't finish it.     By the time we left the garbage cans were overflowing and they ran out of ice at the beverage station. . this location does well at lunch time.   It was a great lunch!!    Thanks Moes !"}
{"text":"this particular Moe's is horrible!!!! I will never return the staff is very unpleasant. I went in for lunch and there was a girl who made my food, who was on the heavy side. She had a extremely dirty apron on and when she bent over and reached for the onions to put on my burrito the ingredients that were on on my burrito were on her apron. She did not even offer to make it over, but I insisted she make it over. Then she was giving me all kinds of attitude. My last trip there will surely be my last visit EVER to Moe's ever."}
{"text":"This is a replacement for previous mexican food joint in the Cleveland Clinic cafeteria.   Moe's is a good place to go for lunch for me because they are well organized and usually very fast with their order. Unlike other Moe's, this place does not have salad bar like arrangement, this place is where you order your burrito beforehand with all the free ingredients you want. There is salsa buffet like arrangement with nice options.   It is typical mexican fast food but a nice change from cafeteria food by Aramark."}
{"text":"Good food but its like a express line, one item per-person"}
{"text":"A welcome addition to the worsening cafeteria scene. It has replaced the LaSalsa which was also mexican place. The difference between this one and the other Moe's is that it does not have a Chipotle like bar where you can pick and choose ingredients. Because this place is the same set up as LaSalsa. you have to order whatever you want on your salad or burrito at the time of ordering and that also limits you from making sure that the quantities of each ingredient is per your taste.   The food is mostly fresh and palatable. They have good selection of salsa on the bar to choose from and they are consistently good. Every dish is served with some freshly made chips. I have not ordered anything other the their Art Vandalay Jr (based on Seinfeld). It is a filing with chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Great new location in Monroe. Staff was very nice and even pointed out a few specials that would save me money as I was thinking about what to order. Got the 'Billy Barou' Nachos and it was stacked high! Really good amount of food for the price. The restaurant was very clean as the staff quickly cleared/cleaned tables as guests left. I'll definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the food.  They use some spice in their salsa that I do not care for.  I ordered a chicken quesadilla and it was just OK.  Not bad but just OK.  They offer grilled mushrooms which is a bonus because I love mushrooms.  And they were good but the rest of the quesadilla had a tangy flavor to it.  The chips were good and I tried 2 of the salsas which I did not care for.  The people working here were very nice but not that helpful when asked questions about the food.  The place itself was nice and new."}
{"text":"Eat at moe's all the time, when this one opened up, I simply had to go. Still haven't been let down. Although they could do with giving you more tortilla chips. When I went it was filled about 4 inches with a burrito and beans in it."}
{"text":"Mexican food at an airport? YES PLEASE! Too bad it did not live up to Moes standards!  The employees working that day were too busy eating chips, laughing, throwing things at each other, and just plain goofing off.   We ordered a veggie burrito and it was barely filled, the employee wrapped things up before we could ask for cheese and cilantro. The burrito was not bad, but it was not amazing!   Limited seating, which fills up fast. A couple customers were literally just standing up around tables eating.  They do give you free chips with your meal and salsa, but the worst of all is getting chips from an employee who has been eating out of that same batch. *gross*  & because this is an airport Moe's, they do not have a salsa bar like others, so you have to ask for whichever salsa you want at the cash. (I like the freedom to look at the salsas and try out a few without having to bug the cashier).  This is one of the Moe's that would have benefited from Undercover Boss! MOE, You should pay a visit to this location!!  Definite skip, there are better options at the airport."}
{"text":"I love this location. I visit here sometimes three times a week! How can I turn down a place that has tofu and an amazing staff!"}
{"text":"I love Moe's. I have always been a huge fan! I just wish their food was packaged better for travel. This is the second time my new car has been covered in Moe's food. I've been to this location multiple times and have only encountered one friendly employee. Just now, the young girl, rolled her eyes when I ordered my quesadilla. When I questioned the young man who was finishing up. He mumbled something under his breath and kept going."}
{"text":"Very slow service, they're so disorganized with the food line. The nachos were cold, soggy, and chewy by the time I actually got to taste them."}
{"text":"Call me biased, but I'm not sure why anyone would come here when there's a Chipotle not even 2 minutes away. This food just doesn't taste good.. And there was an eyelash in my queso.. kind of unsettling."}
{"text":"My first visit was today.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Many options to choose and add to burrito or bowl.  Tasted fresh and flavorful.  Guac could be a little better.  Salsa bar is great idea.  I thought it was better than Chiptole's except for the Guac."}
{"text":"Dark, dingy, sticky tables and floors, smells weird. Food was nothing special, they don't know how to assemble a burrito.  And apparently whether you get the largest burrito (like my husband did) or the kids burrito (like my daughter did) the fillings are the same portion.  What????!   1 star for tofu, mushrooms, and cilantro options. Other than that chipotle is my go to."}
{"text":"I typically really enjoy moe's. I've been a regular customer at their dilworth location for years. This location had really poor customer service. I've only been here once, but I'm really reluctant to return. The employee who fixed my burrito bowl seemed like he was irritated at me for some reason. When he processed my order at the register, my bowl was on special for 2 dollars. He seemed very upset that it was on special and frustrated that i wouldn't have to pay the normal amount. Very unusual. No complaints about the food or cleanliness of the store. Just a rude employee."}
{"text":"I've been to several dozen Moe's across the US - and this one might be the worst. The service is fine, but the several times I've been here (with a layover at LAS) the place has been dirty and the food is bland. Moe's is a big Midwest/East Coast chain and most of them are pretty good. This one blows."}
{"text":"I went into Moe's today and didn't get the usual \"WELCOME TO MOE'S!!!\" and you know what? That made me sad. Have they stopped doing this? I've always enjoyed being yelled at when I walk into an establishment but I guess others don't.   Anywho, this is a pretty standard Moe's but it's baller status in my book because they have an outdoor patio on the side. Plus they give you free chips and have a variety of salsa to try. They even have one named the El Guapo and any salsa named after a character in Three Amigos rocks my world. Definitely stop in for Moe Monday--burrito, chips and a drink for $5--nothing wrong with that!"}
{"text":"I've been a semi-regular (once a month) at this Moe's since they opened back in '01 or so.  At first my training buddy and I frequented it for the large, and relatively healthy, chicken burritos...(the Joey Bag O Donuts.)  They also have a salsa bar with some really good options including one called \"Who Is Kaiser Salsa?\" (See \"The Usual Suspects\" for reference.) The friendly atmosphere (Welcome to Moe's!) and dead-musician theme and made it a unique favorite.  This Moe's has become a neighborhood institution as shown by the outpouring of sympathy and support in the aftermath of the tragedy a couple of years ago. Unfortunately, the service and quality have also slipped over the years.  Nowadays you don't always get a welcome shout and the staff just don't seem to be as focused on the customers as they used to be.  In fact, they seem to spend a lot of time shouting at full volume to each other.  However, it's still a good lunch at a good price in the heart of Dilworth."}
{"text":"It's edible enough to not starve on your flight but if you have the time walk to Burger King or somewhere else!  I had the chicken quesadilla and it was ehhh but at least I'm not hungry before I board. The salsa that comes with the chips taste like store bought salsa."}
{"text":"This place is like a Mexican style Subways, love all the choices,  I'm hungry thinking about it.    Tried their breakfast for the first time, I ordered the breakfast bowl, filled with scrambled eggs, hash brown, bacon, and cheese.  I always did enjoy my eggs with salsa, something I'd try again.    Conveniently located near our airport gate, got to our gate extra early so we enjoy breakfast and not have to rush.  Satisfied and ready to fly."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Moe's around town and this is my favorite.  The line moves quickly and the food is good.  They have a check in where you enter your phone number 10 times and get a free meal.  Added bonus.  I asked other Moe's about this and they laughed.  It's a nice perk."}
{"text":"Worse than Taco Hell. Absolutely zero flavor, over priced and a little on the dingy side. Very boring food! Nothing Mexican about it."}
{"text":"I'm real disappointed in myself for not looking at Yelp before eating here. This place is just awful. It's a chipotle concept with a McDonald's quality. Nothing but the chips were good. I ordered a burrito with chicken and ground beef. Somehow the tortilla was cold after loading in a bunch of hot items. Ate 3 bites and there it away. Never be back, ever."}
{"text":"I love Moe's. I love when they yell 'Welcome to Moe's!' when you walk in the door. I love their food and I really, REALLY love the service at this location. Trisha and Darla were super amazing while making our food. They were super fun to talk to and really engaging. Their customer service was excellent.  Sahar is the manager and she went above and beyond to help us. We walked in to have lunch and also were distraught because another restaurant was not helpful and super rude to us while we were trying to make a catering order for my sister's wedding.   Sahar took amazing care of us. She was super knowledgeable about all of the products and services Moe's offers for catering. Which is awesome, considering the store is so new to the area.  The pricing was really fair and a lot better than some other choices we had for the wedding.  I am so happy we went with Moe's to cater my sister's wedding. The food is great, well seasoned and there are so many options.   THANK YOU MOE'S!!"}
{"text":"I don't leave a 1 star review with a light heart, nor do I leave them feeling angry. Sometimes you just experience something that's just bad. I wasn't treated bad, there wasn't anything necessarily wrong with my food, nor was the restaurant dirty. This comes from a location standpoint, and not against the Moe's franchise itself.  This location offers all of the same food fair as any other Moe's, but they're not all owned by the same people. From what I understand, they're franchised. The staff at this location isn't interpersonal for starters. I've heard employees, right in front of me, argue because they'd given me too much steak once. The salsa just isn't as good as other locations (i'll get to that in a moment), no one is friendly, and the food is super hit or miss in quality at this location. You could go 2 days in a row, get a steak burrito with your typical toppings, and one day it be okay, and the next it's like a different restaurant gave it to you, in a I never want a burrito from you again kind of way. Their ingredients don't always look fresh (steak was grey the other day, been to Moe's over 100 times, first time I received steak of a different hue). Hence the salsa. The salsa here just doesn't have the same taste every time, and I know, because el guapo is my staple. Did I mention that 2 times that i've went, salsa's were damn near straight up empty? I wasn't mad, just took note. Bad ju ju, this location.   Rant over.   TL;DR Trust me. Moe's is great. Go to the one on Fishcreek& Graham, 10x better. I've registered my 115th visit at a Moe's, since they started counting, and the Fishcreek & Graham location is the reason i've went over 100 times. Been to the one on Howe 4 times, and i'm not doing it again. Take the trip to the Fishcreek & Graham rd location for a true Moe's experience."}
{"text":"The staff are unfriendly except the young man this morning. Not one smile from the 2 girls... they only serve breakfast in the a.m. although i am unsure why i couldnt get veggie bowl unless the rice wasnt ready??  My kid had the bacon breakfast burrito, said it was ok. You can get a drink and guac added to your meal for 2.99 but no chips so unsure what the point of the guac is... wont be back even though i come to the airport 2-3 times a year... not because of the food, but because of the 2 girls... the airport is miserable enough...."}
{"text":"Moe's has dropped in stars for me due to their inability to be open at the posted time. I clocked out for lunch and wasted my time driving to this facility to pull on the door at 11:07 am, and it be locked with employees inside working."}
{"text":"This place is great. Every time I come I get a friedly welcome to Moes and the store is always clean and I always seem to get great portions! Def a favorite spot here in fort mill! The manager, I think his name was johnny, even came to our table to make sure everything was good! A+"}
{"text":"We returned to this Moe's after about a two-year gap.  Why?  Last time we had been there, we had such an awful experience that I wrote to the manager.  He sent me gift certificates to use at another time at that location.    I think the reason for my complaint before was all about poor customer service and restaurant cleanliness.  From our recent experience last night, I see that in the two years that I haven't visited, nothing has changed.    I'm surprised this Moe's stays in business.  First, it's hidden behind a staircase in the strip mall it's in, creating a dungeon-like atmosphere.  Second, it's very narrow, not allowing for much walk space.  And since last night happened to be Kids Eat Free night (a coincidence), it was super-crowded with families and a balloon clown that blocked the only narrow walkway with the throng of kids around him. Getting through over-active kids crowding the tiny walkway to outdoor seating without spilling my salsa was a mighty challenge.   Ordering toppings for your food is always a treat.   The job seems so routine to the food assemblers that they barely pay attention to you and you have to repeat yourself several times.   They screwed up two of the kids' orders because they weren't listening and just hurrying along adding whatever they wanted that they had to start again from scratch.  And then, upon sitting down, we realized that they STILL ended up screwing up the orders.  How hard is it to put tomatoes on one taco and cheese on another?  My burrito came out pretty good, though, because I was meticulous about focusing on what they weren't focusing on.    The cashier rang us up:  a burrito, a salad, a bowl, and two kids meals.  The kids meals were free, so I guess the total came to $22 or so.  We handed them $20 in gift certificates, intending to pay the rest in cash.  Apparently, the task was too difficult for the cashier.  Too many things going on.  The cashier took the gift certificates and told us that we were all set.  He probably voided the order.  I wonder how the restaurant makes any money at all.    Cleanliness?  The salsa bar and drink stand was a mess, but thankfully the salsa containers were all full.  What few tables were open needed to be cleaned.  And there was a giant water spill/puddle in the ordering line.  Certainly a safety hazard.    Will we go back?  Heck no.  If I want Moe's, there are too many better locations in town.  Better yet, I'll head to Chipotle or Qdoba.  p.s. Regarding the \"Welcome to Moe's!\" thing.  Stop it.  It's annoying, and if the employees are going to do it with little to no enthusiasm because it's so routine to them, don't even bother."}
{"text":"I usually don't eat at many Mexican style fast food places, but Moe's is a good choice! I got the nachos and they filled me up! I appreciated the fact that they put the queso on first so all my nacho chips had some, not to mention it was a heaping amount of queso!! I haven't had anything else, but the group I was with said the bowls were good and the burrito was worth the money.  If you are a college student bring your ID because you get 20% off, which is always great! They have 2 Coke soda machines that are the ones where you can chose all the flavor of drinks. The place was clean and not too terribly crowded at dinner time (we went at 6:45). Overall good place to eat if you are in the University area."}
{"text":"Worst meal and experience ever. They had no beef, pinto beans, forks, knives or salsa cups. No forks and knives just boggles me. Taco shells were burned, queso was cold. The place is filthy. I reported it to Mecklenburg County. That was my first time at Moe's, how do they stay in business? Really appalling."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of different Moe's experiences around the country and this one is pretty good. Second time grabbing a bite before heading out of town and it's consistently good. A little pricy, especially after you toss in the beer, but it's the airport so not really shocking. Bonus points for friendly staff."}
{"text":"Love this place but went and got some chips and queso they forgot the queso and told me I was lying about it and I had chicken in a bowl and the chicken was burnt."}
{"text":"WELCOME TO MOE'S!  We stopped by Moe's after a long day of walking around a cornfield.  Wow.  That sounds \"country,\" doesn't it?  Actually, we were working our way through a corn maze for almost 3 hours and needed some nourishment.  Moe's ranks between Qdoba (#1) and Chipotle (#3) for me when it comes to fast food burritos.  However, the best thing about Moe's is that you get a little more value for your money than with the other burrito places.  Moe's gives you FREE chips with your burrito and offers a FREE salsa bar.  After eating my sandwich AND chips, I feel like the stuffed burrito.    I typically like spicy salsas, but Moe's hot salsas are too liquidy for me.  They're basically just hot sauce, not salsa, so I stick to the green tomatillo salsa from their salsa bar, which is out of this world.  It's not spicy at all, but it's so full of sweet flavor that I forgo the hot sauce and go straight for the tomatillo.  I just wish they had bigger containers to spoon it into.  I go through about 5 of their little salsa containers and it seems like a lot of wasted plastic (or a lot of running back and forth to the salsa bar with my tiny cup!).  This particular Moe's has a nice, big outdoor seating area, which was perfect for us to enjoy the sunny, fall day."}
{"text":"I visit this Moe's in Dilworth occasionally for lunch on Saturdays.  I think the burritos taste a bit better at Qdoba and Chipotle, but Moe's offers something the others don't:  free chips and a salsa bar with a variety of yummy salsas (including my fave, the sweet green tomatillo salsa; I could literally eat buckets of it).    I hate the whole \"Welcome to Moe's!\" thing when I go into a Moe's.  It's very insincere sounding and just sounds so unenthusiastic/routine.  Nobody even looks up to smile and greet you.  They just listen for someone to come in the door and shout.  I'd have nightmares about it if I worked there.    Anyway, the service there always seems a bit off whenever I go.  It takes awhile for someone to greet you because they're busy doing whatever side work they're doing and/or talking amongst themselves.    This last time around, I tried the vegetarian burrito.  It comes with \"free\" guacamole whereas you have to pay to get it on the meat-filled burritos.  It seems kind of silly to ask me what I want on my burrito, but they do.  I want everything that's listed on the menu, that's what I want.  Maybe they're hoping I don't ask for the more-expensive guac even though it says it comes with it?    The male manager who works there and operates the cash register is usually quite rude, abrupt, and doesn't care whether you're there or not.  And, most times, he's watching a sports game on one of the TVs in the dining room instead of doing his job.  He's your stereotypical store/restaurant manager.  This time, he took time out from frying up nacho chips (a daunting task, I'm sure) to briefly ring me up and sliding my food to me across the counter, before returning to his other task.  Well, thank you, and you have a nice day, too.  For that, you want me to fill up your tip jar prominently located at the register?  Methinks not.  The burrito seemed a bit small without the meat.  Qdoba and Chipotle seem to give you more rice and beans.  Maybe this would be a good idea for Moe's, too, especially on vegetarian burritos?  It tasted pretty good, though, but the guac could have been a bit fresher and brighter green.  And, naturally, the chips and unlimited tomatillo salsa were fantastic.  They even have a new salsa: a mixture of a tomato salsa and tomatillo.  It was good, too, but I still preferred the green tomatillo.    I give the burrito a solid B, the chips and salsa bar an A++, and the service a C.  Hence, my four stars."}
{"text":"First off this location is in the airport. I choose a burrito bowl which came with one scoop of rice, beans and an even small scope of chicken. $15 for a bowl and small fountain drink. Way over priced. Bowl wasn't even half full. Taste was bland and not worth it but it was one of the few places that offered seating."}
{"text":"Typical Moe's. Food was fine. My only comment is that the service was sloooooowwww. The staff moved very slowly and deliberately, even though I counted 11 of us waiting to order. Like watching a slo-mo movie on an iPhone."}
{"text":"well, i'd say Moe's was OK. we stopped in for a late lunch - as it's National Taco day.  Full disclosure: i wanted to go somewhere else but we were heading northwest to go to Gibbs and we'd never been to Moe's so that's what we decided to try.  Danielle got a beef taco and a chicken taco. I had a a chicken taco and a steak taco. Danielle also got a side of queso w/ her chips.   Pros:  - the service was good to great. our servers were very nice and very quick. - salsa bar! - Coca-Cola Free-style machine - Cherry Vanilla Diet Dr Pepper!! - great selection of toppings/ingredients - free chips and salsa   Cons: - the meats were lukewarm, except for the ground beef. Danielle said that was hot.  - the tortillas are quite small for the amount of food being stuffed into them - it's very messy. - the steak was over-seasoned. it didn't taste good. i could make out a lot of pepper but wasn't sure what else i was tasting - but it wasn't steak. - the men's bathroom, while clean, smelled awful. i can't speak for the ladies' room, but i refused to go back in to wash my hands after eating.  As Danielle put it, it's set up like Chipotle but offering near Taco Bell quality food. I like TB so that's fine but it's way more expensive than TB. She said she'd be willing to go back and try something different. I suppose I would too. But, i'm peeing before we go and I'm bringing baby wipes to clean my hands. Also staying away from the steak."}
{"text":"Well, this was a disappointment. Food prep line seemed overwhelmed. Portion of chicken on my salad was tiny even though I asked for double meat. Took way too long to get through line. Servers were unfriendly and on the surly side as if they were being bothered. I noticed their apathy when dealing with people in front and behind me. Really unfortunate."}
{"text":"We go to Moe's a lot because my kids love it. Unfortunately, the servings have gotten smaller and smaller. My 4 year old has to get an adult meal because the tortillas have gotten so small. Tonight (11/10/16), my Joey burrito had so little inside I felt like I was eating a rolled up tortilla. My wife's Rupricy nachos were basically chips with a sprinkling of toppings.   I don't know if it's this location, but I feel like it's gotten worse and worse. I don't know if I can come back here again. It may be time to stick a fork in Moe's."}
{"text":"Always enjoy the food at Moe's and this one is no different. The line was what I would expect at a Moe's; fairly long, but it does move quickly.  PLEASE figure out what you want while you are in line.  A sign nearer eye level would help everyone out.  Also, the drink machine is one of the touch screen one's.  Many, many choices.  Which means kids stand there & stare at screen after screen.  They should really think about getting another one.  Lots of food.  If you aren't hungry, you will have plenty to take home."}
{"text":"OOOPS.  Moe's in the University area is now closed all of a sudden.  They've packed their bags and taken down the signs.  Was it something I said?"}
{"text":"This location is consistently bad. We have given this place chance after chance and each time we do, we regret it. It's not the food that's bad, it's the service. Every time we order food online, we arrive home and something is totally missing and/or completely wrong. I've called management and they act indifferent about it. The employees are young and could care less about providing good customer service and making sure they complete orders accurately. After years of consistently bad service, we are done with this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst meal!!! Took 20 minutes to even order with 2 people in restaurant. The two workers couldn't move any slower and could care less. Chicken was hard as a rock and not fresh at all. Very  poor quality food. The location could be so great right next to the movie theater but with this bad food it has no chance. Food was expensive. Family of 4 with one entree each $50. Don't go!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this Moe's a number of times. At least 15 or more. The food is OK. I enjoy the taco's and burritos. The staff is ok too. They are friendly and make your food to your liking. The big standout is the cleanliness. The tables are always dirty, the salsa area, the pop area all very dirty, all the time, every time. I have never ever in my times there seen an employee clean up the dining room or any of the areas mentioned. That is my complaint. If they can just get that handled. I'd give them better review."}
{"text":"Quantity of food was short vs the price. Service was okay nothing outstanding. It must be under new mgmt or the servers were lazy.  Won't be going back..."}
{"text":"I love this place! Yes, even more than Chipotle. I like having more options to choose from and not being charged for them. I wish there was one located closer to Oakland, but this will do. The store is clean and located in Market Square surrounded by lots of food, music (sometimes), and entertainment (sometimes). Depending on when you go, parking can be challenging. Their guacamole is excellent by the way."}
{"text":"I wish I could have gave the restaurant no stars. This establishment manager push me out of the door once I asked for a refund for food they never made. We placed an order online for the Epicenter location. The order was placed at 7:37pm and the order was suppose to be done at 7:57. I arrived at 8:00pm. To my surprise, once I walked in, one the worker there yells out \"We're closed\". I was confused and had to recheck my receipt to make sure the location was right. And to make sure the payment went though. The manager explained to me that he ran out of chicken and never made the order. And that I arrived after they closed. I told the manager that the website said they closed at 9:00pm. The manager told me that the website was wrong (since the incident they have now changed the hours). I then asked to speak to a manager to receive a refund. The manager told me to get my refund from the app. I told him over and over again that I didn't place my order on an app. I placed my order on Moe's website. By this time it's 8:10pm, I'm now in an augment with another employee who had a lot to say. The guy sweeping the floor called me a b@-/& several times. The manager is asking me to leave. I'm okay with leaving with a refund or information on how to get a refund. Which I received neither! The manager calls Epicenter security and the lady arrives and asked me to walk outside. I inform her that I just want either a refund or a corporation phone number or phone franchise number. The manager then pushes me several times of of the door into the Epicenter security. This is a man pushing a woman. A manager pushing a paying customer. I've worked in restaurants all of my life, as hostess, bartender, assistant manager and this could have NEVER happened. The staff showed no remorse, no apology or  sympathy  that I had hungry kids at home. I've never step feet back in Moe's again!"}
{"text":"Blah. This chain can't hold a candle to Chipotle. The food is bland and boring. You could easily make this at home with an Ortega burrito kit, a can of beans, and some basic grocery store items.   Also, the fact that there menu is a list of random pop culture references makes it difficult for someone coming in cold not knowing what to order.   If you are feeling a burrito, there is a chipotle not to far from this location."}
{"text":"DO NOT FALL INTO THE TRAP. the only good things about moes are the guac and the queso. and my boyfriend likes the soda machine. but the quality of ingredients is poor, the steak is gross. my boyfriend said the chicken was okay, not as good as chipotle though. almost everything has no flavor. the rice, the salsas. and our bill for guac and 2 drinks, a bowl and a burrito is $25 dollars... not worth it what so ever. we read mixed reviews and decided to give it a shot, poor choice for $25."}
{"text":"Terrible. Use their online order pickup, food wasn't ready. They then made me wait while they handled two people that walked in after me because I went to the pick up area while they got in line right away. I told them that it was an internet order and they told me they never got it. So then I go to the front of the line after those other two people have gone through, they \"magically\" find the order receipt. So then after they prep the food, they tried to make me pay again. Effing ridiculous. Not so much as an apology."}
{"text":"My food was not good at all, the meat was chewy and undercooked. The customer service was not good either. The restaurant was terribly dirty and had trash all over the floors! It made it hard to eat inside when we were eating in such a filthy food place. We will never be back to this location again."}
{"text":"I think it's important to ask yourself why you won't just drive to chipotle for edible food?"}
{"text":"Use a groupon, kids don't eat free. And they won't warn you about that. Why would I pay money for a 1 year old's kid's meal? Food looks like it's been sitting out all day and no one has touched it.   They advertise some new burritos, there's 3 pictures and they look delicious! And so do the carnitas on the next poster... But \"we don't have that yet\". ?!?  It only gets 3 stars because if u get a steal on a groupon, and use it close to the exact amount and not have to pay too much extra out of pocket, 2-3 people can eat nicely off of a $15 groupon."}
{"text":"Normally, I like Moe's. I am never blown away by the meal, but it's usually at least average. Not today...  Everyone was polite, so that's a positive. But my food was cold and just plain bland. I will probably just stick to Chipotle from now on. It's always fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"The worst service ever!!! Very very veryyy slow the food has been held up in a line for almost 10 minutes!!! Will NEVER come back to Moe's!!! Also the place isn't very clean - just not happy at all! Food is now cold because it was held up in the food line....smh!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time in quite a while this past weekend. My mom was in from out of town and wanted moes. We got there about 7:30, they close at 9, so we were there at least an hour and a half before close.   The group in front of us had specifically ordered tea with their meals, but the restaurant was out of tea and employees didn't want to make more because they were \"about to close\". They finally agreed to make more tea after the group asked for their money back.  My mom ordered a dish with the steak. They were almost out and didn't want to make more of that either. Plus, I had already gotten my burrito, and the girl had already put beans and queso on the chips, so it all would have been mush if we waited. The girl offered my mom to do 1/2 chicken 1/2 steak instead. Not what she had wanted, but whatever.   So we sit down to eat. My burrito was literally half cold tomatoes and the little bit of steak they did put on my mom's nachos was all fatty. Most of the tables were dirty, besides the few that had people at them. The salsa station was a mess and almost all empty. And then an employee came out and started sweeping right next to the tables that had people at them still, as if to hurry everyone along.  The location is ideal, but i was very unimpressed by this visit. Chances are, I will go out of my way to visit a different Moe's in the future."}
{"text":"If you're uptown and after tex-mex, i'd head for Moe's. It's pretty no-nonsense, it's in a good location, and you can sit in and loiter after you finish your meal.  I've tried their tacos and burritos, both of which i've gone the vegetarian option for and then easily veganised by asking for no cheese and sour cream. I tend to always go for a combo, as you generally get a drink, plus a side of guacamole and nachos (if they're stingy, say so and ask for more!) which gives me a reason to gather up a few samples from the salsa bar - a good range of heats and flavours to choose from (go with El Guapo!). Ingredients the meals are created from are fresh, and decent quality. (I cannot speak to the meats on offer, but the beans and the tofu are quite good!)  The seating area is pretty big for a tex-mex place, and like I said - you can loiter. In a slightly food-courtish way there's TV screens with news channels playing, but there's also great piped radio with 70s/80s rock playing softly as background.   I've never had an issue with cleanliness -the dining and salsa/fountain areas are rarely messy, and the bathrooms are kept well.  My three stars would be four if the servers making the meals and taking your money were a little more consistent - some visits my burrito is a bit fatter than others, and some days the cashier's attitude leaves little to be desired (I have one particular person in mind here, otherwise usually when the manager is in and on cash it's smiles and friendliness all-round!). Some days you get a friendly \"Welcome to Moe's!\" when you come in the door, some days you don't."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location and I'm just not a fan.   When I arrived the place was practically empty so I assumed service would be fast. But it was not. I assumed that the food would be tasty and fresh. But it was not.   I ordered a taco salad in the tortilla shell with chicken. The shell tasted stale so I left most of it on the plate. The chicken was not well seasoned and there definitely  wasn't enough chicken on the salad. But I refused to pay $2.19 for one more measly scoop of meat. The other toppings just didn't seem fresh. And I had to ask for the chips which are supposed to come with the meal. I just left disappointed.   Overall, I just was not impressed. And it will be a while before I give them another try."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  The people working there didn't notice me for two minutes when I walked in the door. And then when I was finally acknowledged, they made me feel like an inconvenience.  I ordered a taco bowl with chicken. They ran out of chicken and gave me one tiny scoop of dried out nastiness.  The only reason I am giving it two stars is because it was clean and they have pretty decent salsa and they also give you free chips.  I honestly don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"My first time there and I was NOT at all impressed. I would choose Qdobas or Chipotle any day. I won't be back. If any manager or higher up is reading this your food service people need customer service 911. The guy making my food was rude and to busy talking to his friends behind me and didn't want to be bothered with the fact it was my first time there so I was not sure what to order or what was even good."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them 0 stars!!! This place is the worst dining experience at Downtown Summerlin.  To begin with, the menu is impossible to understand... They give funny names but no description of what exactly you're ordering.   I purchased a Groupon, had to go in 3 times before using it, because every time I went in, they were out of something... How can a Southwest Grill run out of such things as Rice, Beans, or veggies?  I finally went in on a Monday, they run a special that any burrito you buy is $5.99... I advised them that we had a Groupon... I was advised they don't accept those on discounted food, I found that acceptable. My wife ordered a bowl and I ordered a smaller burrito.   Once we got up to pay, I handed the young punk my phone, and he was baffled and told me they can't accept the Groupon I paid for.... He kept insisting that he had to give me the discount price because, \"It's Company Policy!\"   I've eaten there a few times during day hours, and it was fine, but as time has gone by, things have changed.  I will never go back.   Quality of food I rate 2 Stars, Zabas is better, and a cool restaurant called Panchos is within walking distance.   I should've known that Moes is horrible, because every other restaurant at Downtown Summerlin is always packed... This place, not so much!  I wanted to call and speak to the GM, but figured \"What good will that do?\" They'll offer me a free meal I don't want!   I wouldn't recommend this establishment to even my worst enemy!"}
{"text":"Moes opens at 11 not 9. I am driving to Zion and went out of my way to come to moes and it was closed."}
{"text":"I know, I know. Why am I reviewing Moe's of all places? It's like reviewing a McD's or something - they're all bound to be identical. Right? False.  To be totally honest, I generally don't fancy Moe's. If I can help it, I'm more often than not looking for other options. However, I was up in NC for work, and absolutely famished and thoroughly exhausted, and decided to just stop by here for a quick dinner as we drove back home. So, maybe my starvation and exhaustion played major roles in my dinner satisfaction level, but it really was one of the best Moe's experiences of my life. If the Moe's near my house tasted even 80% as good as this location's, I'd probably come more often. I really thought the chips quality to be standardized, but the Moe's here serves substantially better (read: not soggy and sad) chips than at home. Can anyone offer an explanation? Hmm Also to note: the people who work here are extremely friendly and seem to be genuinely happy to be there. I've never met such a happy Moe's crew before and for that, an extra star is wholly deserved.   Yay"}
{"text":"Moe's is my favorite type of the build your own burrito places to go. It's also my husbands. This location in Ballantyne is right on the corner when you want to make a left, but you can't so you have to go to the light, and make a u-turn.   Aside from the difficulty that is getting in, they rest is fantastic. The people working there are generally happy, and I've never had a complaint about the food. The salsa is always fresh, and the soda machine is never out of anything. The place is also really clean, something I know must be difficult, when children and chips are involved."}
{"text":"I thought the burrito ended up being okay but then again I was STARVING!!  They were about to close (at 7pm) and the guy who was making my burrito was making a million and one mistakes with my burrito, he asked if I wanted salsa in the burrito and i said no... and a giant scoop went in... he looked up and he caught himself  then asked if he wanted me to start over but I told him it was okay because I had already noticed there was no more carne asada in his little bucket, and no more guac, and other things.  I got the combo meal which was supposed to come with nachos or guac, I asked for the cheese because I had already seen that there was no more guac and he asked if I wanted salsa and I said no.... all I got was chips and salsa!!  The lady did give my hubby a free drink though (mainly because the two cups were stuck together and she seemed too lazy to take them apart, so she kept saying just take both of them. lol)"}
{"text":"OH MY OH MY OH MY this place is awesome!!!  Some may say it's like Chipotle but I am here to say, no way Moe's is SO much better!!!  Fresh grilled proteins, peppers and onions and they made the taco shell for the taco salad right in front of me.  None of that dusty prefried shells other joints pull out.  I knew it was fresh!  Fresh salsa bar and all the chips you want for free.   The guacamole was prepped right there and the staff was so friendly."}
{"text":"We visited this Moe's yesterday around 3:30PM.  We had a 2 for 1 Burrito coupon and had seen Moe's on Under Cover Boss, so wanted to check it out.  When we walked in no one shouted \"Welcome to Moes\" like we had seen on TV.  As a matter of fact there was no one to be found, except for one customer eating at a table midway towards the rear of the restaurant.  We walked up and down the line a few times and checked out the food.  The meats were covered.  After about 5 minutes we decided to walk out.  Maybe I should have walked to the back to try and find someone to help us or but I didn't.  If business is that slow, put a bell on the door.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went to Moe's tonight for the $5 Moesday promotion. Went with several friends, we got there at 8:50 only to discover that the door was locked. The store hours posted on the door said 9PM closing. What lousy customer relations. We went to Chipolte and had a great experience. Moe's you lost 4 customers tonight."}
{"text":"WELCOME TO MOE'S!!!!  You have to love that warm greeting every time you walk in the door!   I went for lunch and decided to try a taco salad, I told the guy making my salad I really didn't want it the way it was listed on the board, and he replied that it's fine, \"we make it the way you want it so that you love it!\"  How awesome is that!  I started with the taco shell which was crispy and fresh, lettuce, grilled chicken which he warmed up on the grill, cheese, jalapenos, corn salsa (which if you haven tried you must....so delicious!), sour cream, guacamole, onions and BACON...which he also warmed up on the grill...I added the house dressing which was a nice mix of spicy and sweet and really brought the salad together in my opinion.  When he was done creating my salad it looked like a masterpiece and I almost didn't want to eat it! But somehow I managed, lol and it was just as delicious as it looked!  Add the chips and a drink and overall it was an awesome lunch! I would definitely recommend it and we surely be back!"}
{"text":"Moes is an alternative to Chipotle- menu features tacos, burritos, salads, and quesadillas, with your choice of vegetarian/tofu, or various meats. The chicken salad sans the tortilla tends to be my preference. As a major plus, this spot allows you to customize your dish with several free toppings- they do charge for guac and queso,but give generous portions of both.  Service. There was only one lady working to assemble and ring up orders when I came in on a weekend. The line grew to six people before one of the guys watching from the kitchen finally came over to help. She apologized for the delay and let me know the guac was on the house for the inconvenience- which was appreciated.   As for flavors? The salad is the only thing I've found satisfying, and that's with tons of added grilled veggies. The queso has the right consistency but no cheesy flavor, it's really bland. This spot will work in a pinch, but I won't go out of my way to return.  TIP: Check the LVWeekly for coupons. Sometimes it's a BOGO, other times it's a free drink. Free queso day is coming up 9/17!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff! Fresh, hot food. Free chips and salsa bar. Affordable too! Bring a sweater it's always cold. Enjoy"}
{"text":"This Moes is a weekly staple for me. I've always had a great experience with both the food and the staff. The manager is incredibly welcoming, and we both like to chat about Game of Thrones. I feel like a valued customer, and as a chain (and a person who visits other Moe's in Charlotte) this one stands out. 5/5, good game."}
{"text":"Food is decent, but the service is below par. Staff acts like they are doing you a favor. Way more interested in socializing than in customer service."}
{"text":"Amazing as always love it every single time, i love the staff and the food best lunch break in awhile"}
{"text":"Moe's to the rescue!  Seriously.  We recently had plans to host two families for a casual Saturday evening of margaritas and homemade mexican.  On Thursday morning I visited Reyna's in the strip and purchased everything necessary to make a delicious and fresh fiesta.  That same evening in a biking accident, my husband fractured some ribs and punctured his lung.  Because the percocet was talking, he urged me to keep our plans.  I called Moe's Catering and was thrilled that they could not only cater our affair, they could deliver and set up.  I was skeptical that the food was coming from the Wexford location, having read the reviews. I needn't have worried.  The food was fresh, delicious and even more popular than the margaritas.  I urge you to try this location!"}
{"text":"So sad to see the Moe's location closest to my work go downhill.  I agree with other comments- it seems to be lack of proper management.  I've completed the survey in hopes of effecting change and I even got a heartfelt reply from ownership- but there seems to be no action behind it.  The restaurant is dirty, the employees are poorly trained with complete lack of customer service skills and the quality  of food is not up to Moe's standards. I really wish that I could say something positive but sadly. I cannot."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE Moe's fan but I just don't understand why this one in a high traffic, visible location isn't managed better.  The dining room is run down, unkempt and truthfully dirty.  Their employees seem more interested in each other than the customer.  I visited one Monday for their special, which means they are VERY busy and there was a maintenance working hanging a television in the midst of lunch rush. This just signals poor management to me.  Makes me wonder what else is going on...."}
{"text":"The Moe's at the EpiCentre is not as good as other Moe's Southwestern Grill locations in the Charlotte area.  For starters, the prices are higher at this location.  The burritos and tacos are also not as good; with the pinto beans overly flavored and other items somewhat lacking.  Another annoyance is the two Freestyle Coke machines that seem to always be out of some flavors.  Overall, I give this location two stars... it can be better, just that they weren't any of the times I visited."}
{"text":"Prices are terrible- $11 for burrito bowl and drink. Really - I can eat at a Tex-Mex sit down for that price. They push you down the line quickly so you won't ask for to much. Then they ring up your order before you get to the cash register acting like they are really rushed and when you get seated they have run to the back to finish off their cheese dip. You may laugh but look at their shirts"}
{"text":"I went to Moe's in Market Square in Pittsburgh PA on Friday 2-21-2014 as part of a promotional dinner event called The Winter Warm Up. I understand that each place has a set menu for this, but I feel the way I was treated by the manager Robert, was just plain shitty.   We paid $50 for tickets and there were 9 restaurants, so I assumed $5.50 worth of food at each. They had rice, bean, and chicken bowls for us. That were a little small.   I asked if I could have one without chicken, as I am a vegetarian and have been for 15 years. I thought with Moe's \"make it your way\" attitude, that this would be no problem. I was given a flat \"No\" as an answer. So, then I ask if I can take the chicken out myself and then they can put the other toppings on. \"No\" I explain that I paid to come here and I do not eat meat and they ignore me, explaining that the bowls are \"pre-made.\" So, I just take one anyways, and throw away the chicken and proceed out of the line.   At this point, one of the younger staff comes over and asks if I am a vegetarian. When I say yes, he apologizes, and makes me one without chicken, Great!, right????   No, Asshole manager Robert comes over and reams the kid for making mine Veg saying that \"We ain't got time for this shit!\" Well, excuse me?!? First of all, is it really appropriate to 1. talk like this in front of customers, children, and elderly??? 2. talk like this to employees??? 3. be this much of a jerk in general??? Also, there was no one else in line, and everyone in the restaurant had already been served... So what exactly did they not have time for???   NO ONE ELSE WAS DOING ANYTHING!?! What a jerk. Seriously!"}
{"text":"So I just left MOES Northlake and the Male Shift Manager with the long locks was eating and chewing behind the counter while serving customers..his hair was draped over the front of his shoulders which is gross also.... as he is chewing he continues to put his fist to his mouth as if not to lose any food.. god forbid it fall out onto the food he is preparing... i had to say something... his response was I'm not eating, I was chewing... oh okay, so chewing is the process of what?? Exactly....meanwhile the dining room is gross.. workers from Buffalo Wild Wings are getting free food and he is going back and forth to their table eating and then back behind the counter with the same gloves!!!! I WILL NEVER EVER EAT AT NORTHLAKE MOES AGAIN!!! Disgusting filthy horrible experience ... not to mention they had hand written signs on the door saying \"sorry we don't have chips\" ...and if I were you I'd stay far away from this place!!!!"}
{"text":"This was a horrible experience. I placed an order online and got an error message saying my card info was wrong. I realized that since the last time I ordered my billing address had changed. I fixed the billing address and my card was accepted. The money came from my account but I never received order confirmation. My wife went to pick up the order and was told that the order didn't come and had her contact your 3rd party vendor stating it was an issue for my wife the consumer and this 3rd party vendor to work out, and was not Moe's responsibility. Larissa who claimed to be a general manager had a piss poor attitude, had 0 clue on how to handle this problem. My wife was able to obtain a phone number for a gentleman named John who I had the pleasure of speaking with wanted to give credit while at the same time defending the unprofessional methods of this manager. No credit is needed as I wont be returning with the many other good service restaurant's in the area. John proceeded to tell me that the money was never received because the night had not been batched out yet, and could not grasp when I told him that I had to physically call my bank to dispute these charges for any true resolution to take place. This was a painful ordeal and John could not phathom that this RGM could of done anything wrong. I personally prefer Moe's by a slight margin over the tastes and variety of Chipotle but will chose great service vs slight taste preference in this case every time."}
{"text":"Used to give them 4/5 stars, until they wouldn't let me use a coupon on my BIRTHDAY. Just wanted a quick bite to hold me over. My boyfriend was fully prepared to pay for his meal & my drink but they did not honor the coupon for one free entree. There are so many accommodating establishments on your birthday so I just walked on. Ridiculous and I could make it at home for 1/3 the price."}
{"text":"The salsa bar is awesome.  With veggies, mushroom, peppers, onions, olives, cucumbers, guacamole, corn and cilantro the veggie bowl was superb.  They come with free chips - huge serving. I would come here over Chipotle any day."}
{"text":"I was drawn in to Moe's because of the 5.99 Monday sepcial. I have to say I am very impressed. The ingredient choices offer the chance to build a bowl or burrito that has some real flavor and variety. Unlike Chipotle chips are free and the salsa bar is amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent Location. Clean restaurant. Impressive salsa and drink selection what is not to like here"}
{"text":"I was trying to leave no stars but minimum is 1. Your welcome! The staff is horrible and they are very rude. I am talking about the Friday Staff. I have never seen someone so rude in my whole life. The heavier set lady was very rude and disrespectful. The portion of their was very light. Salsa was burgundy color (not fresh). I walked back to get a card and they were pouring the mixed food that I decided not to purchase back to the trays. It was so disgusting. I am glad I walked out, I will be calling their headquarters and health department next. This is unacceptable. What happened to food quality and service?"}
{"text":"We have eaten dinner at Moe's several times the past year--- always great... BUT today we went there for lunch.  REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE!!!!   we always order guacamole on everything we order even though it is extra $$. We have always felt it was well worth the extra $$. But on Friday, March 25 at 12:14 pm we got maybe one small teaspoon on each item.  Even the giant burrito we order had a little tiny teaspoon and that was even after I complained about the amount on the four steak tacos we ordered.   Kim was the one making the tacos and when I said we usually get more guac on the tacos She said \"This is how much we put on\".  The guac container was almost empty BEFORE she started on our order.  So on four steak tacos and one chicken burrito we were given less than two tablespoons of guac for about $5 extra.  When I asked for the owners card she just told me to leave a review on Yelp.  I could not believe that !!!!!   Who wants a BAD REVIEW about their restaurant?????   She knew the review would be bad because I keep telling her she was not putting enough guac on each taco.  I said just because you are running out of guac that is no reason to skimp on the current customer.  She did not care at all.   By the way.... There was No Line at Moe's and when I was leaving I noticed that at Pieology, next door, the line was out the door.  I can see why Moe's was not busy at all and Pieology was packed.  I'll be going to Pieology or even Five Guys next time..... Do yourself a favor and skip Moe's Southwest Grill."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this place out. The staff was friendly and the place was clean-ish. Moe's had a Monday Moe's special where all burritos were one price so we decided to try the burritos.  We both got the Joey Bag (which is the \"homewrecker\" without the guacamole).  The burrito was just \"eh\".  We did meet some people who said this was their new favorite place. the place make fresh nachos and supply four different salsa ranging from hot (made with ghost pepper) to mild."}
{"text":"Moe's is a great choice for fresh, quick, burritos, tacos, quesadillas and salads.  All of the items are made with a selection of different meats and the multitude of fresh and free ingredients which makes your meal a true one of a kind. I like the fresh-grilled steak on my burritos!  All of the salsas, vegetables, toppings are made fresh in-house each day.  The best part is when you buy any item you get unlimited free chips and house-made salsas!  Moe's is a great place for groups, families, and just yourself.  You will not go hungry here!  Give Moe's a try!"}
{"text":"Jeez I don't know why such a low score my joey tufo burrito is always the best. I love moe's! Yea sure some of the kids in there can't roll a burrito to save their lives but my food is always super tasty... Despite the awkward shape my burrito comes in lol!"}
{"text":"SInce the Salsarita's at the Quad closed, this is the closest place to get a quick burrito fix when I am at the office.  I think the burritos are ok here but I preferred the chips & queso at Salsarita's.   I haven't been sickened by the chicken here, but reading that review makes me wonder if I should just drive a little further and head over to Qdoba at Stonecrest when I am in the mood for a quick burrito to take back to the office."}
{"text":"Somewhat displeased by this particular Moe's visit, since the Mooresville location is so good & the Northlake Mall spot is, as well.  Specifics: Monday afternoon, around 2:30 PM.  Yes, I was greeted with the standard, \"Welcome to Moe's\" & the staff was very friendly & quick with my order. AND being it was Monday, I got my entire meal of \"Joey Bag of Donuts\", chips & drink for $5.55 ($6.00 with tax). The chips (my favorite), were great & what I'm accustomed to. They have the \"futuristic\" Coke products machine, which I love having such a variety of beverages to choose from.  However, here are some not so great things I noticed:  - In looking at some of the \"offerings\", the lettuce looked brown, other \"fillings\" didn't look fresh - salsa bar - two of the bowls barely had any salsa in them & the ones that were filled looked like they had been sitting entirely too long - floor was dirty - 93% sanitation grade (wish I had seen earlier) - the ground beef wasn't drained well, so my burrito was extremely greasy & apparently no slotted spoon for the pico de gallo, as the burrito was very watery, too  Parking is plentiful & Moe's is in a busy shopping area. They have patio seating, as well. The inside isn't too big, but they have booths & tables, to accommodate families & groups nicely. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Usually very good staff and food- Fathers Day was a bust. Poor staff morale. I like the nachos, the salsa bar and the custom pop machine."}
{"text":"Moe's to me is the place to go when I can't get to Chipotle. That's actually exactly how I ended up eating here last week - the line for Chipotle was just too long to stand in considering some coworkers and I had a work meeting we had to get to an hour or so later.  When we walked into Moe's we got right in line and were impressed by how quickly it moved. The staff here are definitely really fast and efficient - I actually totally forgave them for asking to repeat myself a couple times just because you could see the whirlwind pace they had to work at during the lunch rush to keep things moving. Kudos to them for clarifying things rather than risking messing up my order just to keep the line moving. We admittedly made fun of the menu set-up while waiting, though, since none of us got why they felt the need for funny order names here. 90% of the names don't tell you anything about what you're ordering, making them totally pointless and even potentially confusing. And I mean, are fancy order names really helping you compete with places like Chipotle?  Anyway, all of our food was tasty enough, although my \"Overachiever\" tacos weren't particularly deserving of their name. They were fine and I enjoyed them, but they weren't exceptional either; if anything I think more meat and black beans would have balanced out the insane amount of guacamole they came with. I wasn't psyched when I sat down and discovered that I'd gotten a semi-flat cup of coke from the drink machine, either. And I know someone will get mad at me for saying this, but I also wasn't particularly in love with the chips. Honestly I need to start remembering to ask them not to give them to me; they just taste so bland and I get so many that I don't want them, and I feel awful throwing them out.  I also need to add something about this particular establishment - do not sit by the middle set of doors if you don't have to, especially in the winter. Unfortunately for us the only open table we could get was right by those doors, so throughout the meal the door constantly opened and slammed shut, resulting in cold winter air drafts and a small headache on my part from the noise.  All in all, this Moe's does offer very quick service and ok food, but you do need to watch out for certain parts of the seating area. They're a fine enough place to eat, just don't expect anything extraordinary either."}
{"text":"Should be Larry, Curley and MOE's Grill... 3 Stooges up in here!!  What part of Extra don't you understand. Had to ask multiple times for more toppings. If I don't take rice then don't be so stingy on peppers/onions.  And wife/kid passed on meat but still had to beg numb skulls for extra salsa n cheese.  Chips are over fried & too greasy.  The seasonal salsa (ahhh-vocado salsa) was empty and never got refilled while we were here. And they weren't busy! Best part was girl came out to clean tables (errr give us all cancer) & was spraying cleaner like a knuckle head. The excessive overspray plume was all around us:  2 tables on 1 side, 3 on other.. no escape!  We started counting sprays after first table.. she did 17, 11, 13, 9.  I could taste the chemicals it was that obtrusive!   Do you have to fumigate right next to patrons eating?!"}
{"text":"The boring version of chipotle. ingredients dry not a lot of flavor about the same price as chipotle would not go here again."}
{"text":"I love Moe's! I like the John Coctostan and chicken nachos. They always give you a lot of food for the price and chips on the side (no extra cost). I can't get enough of the green salsa."}
{"text":"The girl was bubbly but not friendly. I asked for half chicken, half steak, and she said she had to charge extra for extra meat. I explained to her that I did not want extra meat, simply half portions of each meat. She said that \"it's still extra meat.\" She then put two scoops of chicken into my meal. How hard would it have been to do one scoop of each meat without an additional charge? Even though she was very loudly bubbly, she lacked personality and friendliness. She seemed rushed or bothered. The food line counter was very dusty, you could see the difference between the edge on the client side and the inside. It grossed me out but I was already mid order. The iced beverage area by the register only had 1 bottled drink in it and be ice was melting like it had not been refreshed for hours. The salsa counter and beverage area had water all over the floor like there was a leak. There were 2 rugs in place for safety and a wet floor sign but it clearly needed attention. As I looked for a place to sit, there were a couple of dirty tables, that had not been tended to once the patrons departed before I arrived. While I sat and ate, I could hear everyone's conversations, including the girl asking people for their order and I was sitting in the furthest corner from the front, as there was no music playing. Total atmosphere killer. The food lacked flavor, the lettuce was browning like it was old, and the guac tasted like it was straight out of a bag. As a Moe's lover, I was very disappointed when I visited this location. Overall, the lack of care, cleanliness, and quality was extremely disappointing. I will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"I went to Moe's today for lunch with some co-workers, the people working behind the counter were very unfriendly and almost downright snippy, totally not the kind of people you want interacting with your customers. Food was decent, overpriced for what you get, in my opinion. We work nearby but unfortunately we will not be back, there are many other places where you'll be greeted with a smile."}
{"text":"Avoid this place!   Who decided to put this place in an airport!?  Do not eat at moes ever and especially if you are about to board an airplane.  Me and my traveling companion both were sick as dogs after eating here!  We both had the nachos which were less than mediocre and barely warm"}
{"text":"I loved Moe's when I worked in Indiana,  was happy to see that we now have them here in Vegas! While the employees are not as enthusiastic when you walk in the door maybe that'll come with time. The food is great and the queso is awesome!"}
{"text":"Very unclean establishment.  Unfriendly people.  Felt like I was breaking up a negative staff meeting when I went to order.  I was greeted by backs being turned to my family.  One employee spoke up and told the others they had customers.  Not a friendly place.  Floors in the dining area were dirty with trash all over the floor.  Tables were all slimed.  After watching one employee picking up some trash...  they walked into the cooking area and made chips without removing plastic gloves they used to pick up trash and re-slime the tables.  Very unclean place.  Watch the Health Code Score!  Guess the owners are oblivious to conditions!  Would be nice to eat at a clean Moe's Franchise...."}
{"text":"This Moe's seems a bit different then street Moe's maybe due to CCF food policies. But it is a nice option for guest & visitors."}
{"text":"The pros are the free chips and salsa bar. Cons are numerous:  place was dirty, food quality is awful, only one person working the line and the same person running the register, steak was not real meat.  Chipotle is right down the street and is our usually go to place before the movies, but the kids wanted to try MOE'S.  Adults will choose next time..."}
{"text":"Kept it simple and had queso and chips with a side of Corona.  This isn't a huge place but its right at the lip of the end of the wing so you have a good view of all the places to catch flights on this concourse.   I don't understand what people expect, it's an eatery in an airport. Of course it's expensive. Of course it isn't \"your way\" like many sit-down restaurants.   That being said its clean and hit the spot for a fast pick-me-up.   +1 for allowing me to walk out to gamble on the slot machines with my brew-ha-ha in hand."}
{"text":"I'm not going to this moes anymore. Last time I tried to call ahead but they said I wasn't allowed to do that, even though I've done it with that location multiple times. Then when I came in they were out of black beans and chicken. Which okay sometimes that happens but the staff was rude about the whole thing. Today I ordered a joey jr. I got a burrito the size of a moo moo.  I asked for more rice and beans because the guy literally did not put a full scoop on my burrito but I was ignored. Don't waste your time or money at this moes.    I'm only 5'6\" my hands aren't that big y'all."}
{"text":"Well I finally gave Moe's a shot, and I was really disappointed. First off, I loved the menu names and the TV show/movie references they made, but they didn't include any descriptions. Is there something I'm missing here?  Anyways, when I got to the counter I ordered a burrito and built it to my liking and found somewhere to sit.  Once I sat down I immediately noticed that the table smelled foul. The area smelled mildewy and really ruined the meal before it even started. The burrito itself was just not very good. Somehow it wasn't particularly warm, and it was lacking flavor despite the various ingredients and sauces I put on it. I did enjoy that the meal came with chips and there was a salsa bar available. Overall, I was sadly underwhelmed. I may have came on an off day, but Moe's failed to live up to the hype. I'm all for second chances, but it won't come anytime soon for Moe's."}
{"text":"WELCOME TO MOE'S!!!  This is what you hear whenever you walk into any Moe's location.  It's a pretty cool little Mexican joint that leaves you very full.  Moe's is on par with Salsarita's, Chipotle, and Qdoba.  Its not-quite-fast-food-Mexican that tastes fresh.  Of all these chains, I give Moe's the highest rating for freshly seasoned meats. My fav is the quesadilla-they use fresh cheese, yo!  And unlike other chains, they treat you like a big kid and let you serve yourself unlimited salsas.    Note: The Kaiser is a little sweet and not so spicy, the tomatillo es muy picante!    The staff are pretty friendly. I told one of front line staff that they needed some plastic knives and the cook came out with a huge butcher knife and asked if I wanted to borrow his. Mu ha haaa!!!  Service around closing can be haphazard, they pretty much close up shop as you're eating.  Otherwise, this might be a good place to start an evening on the Dilworth bar/restaurant/entertainment circuit."}
{"text":"This is not Tex-Mex.  Being from Texas, I judge this type of cuisine rather harshly.  Regardless, Moe's Southwest Grill would fall short in the mouths of many yelpers.  I ordered the Joey Combo, which included a Joey chicken burrito, queso & chips, and a drink.  The chicken and rice in the bland burrito was so dry even when combined with salsa.  The queso was a big solid lump of white cheese.  The salsa station was a mess.  When I picked up a to-go salsa container, I did not expect it to be all over my fingers.  You are better off going to Chipotle if you want a better burrito."}
{"text":"Great food! Salad was delicious.  Stack was very good and different than anything we've had before. Very clean and employees super friendly. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Moe's straight up ripped me off not only was their employee rude. He made my order entirely wrong. I'm not happy.  I paid 20$ for my food and barley any of it was correct. I ordered at 8:30pm I was there to pick up at like 8:55 and I got home my order wasn't correct he assured us it was correct. He was on his phone and there wasn't anyone in there but me and my girlfriend. We paid extra money for Queso and didn't even get that. The employee didn't even say \"welcome to moe's\" like he's supposed to. He was too busy being on his phone to even close down by himself or even take online orders correctly."}
{"text":"The food was good but the person that took my order appeared to have an attitude.  The restaurant was a mess.  One trash can was overflowing and almost every table was dirty. Before leaving I let an employee know that someone needed to wipe down the tables. Not sure if it was done. I'm not sure if I'll go back."}
{"text":"Cash only for now, but people are friendly and knowledgable about their restaurant. Perfect for lawyers, protestors, and movie makers because the name, MOE, stands for movies, outlaws, and entertainers."}
{"text":"Don't do it!! Stop... the only positive thing I can say about this place is that it was nice & clean, plus the service was super quick - as it should be if you are the only people in the place... was my first indicator that the food wasn't that great; and it most definitely was not! Do yourself a solid and just hit Chipotle, Cafe Rio, or Baja Fresh; or better yet pick up a California burrito from Roberto's to pass off to the staff cause I doubt they eat there either!"}
{"text":"I'm super impressed with moes. Everything to their Moes Monday specials, to the excellent service, to their rewards program is awesome. Not to mention free chips and salsas and an awesome pop machine that lets you customize what flavors you want (last time I got peach vanilla soda-YUM).   My only complaint is that the pork is on the saltier side, but it's delicious regardless."}
{"text":"Had the chicken rice bowl. Only meal I had that evening. About six hours later, I got sick. Definitely will not be returning. Food was just about warm. Not hot at all."}
{"text":"Not even sure how people can compare this establishment to Chipotle. I know it's not the same, but the food is just awful. I guess you can say it's \"fresh\" but who knows it doesn't taste that way. Only thing decent was the queso and chips. I got a spicy chicken bowl and the flavors were just generic tasting. My green tea even tastes like old water. So so so disappointed after wasting my money here. Will definitely make the longer drive to chipotle. Thumbs way down Moe's."}
{"text":"I am half way through my steak burrito and don't think I want to go any further.   It's so salty that I can hardly stomach it.   If the burrito was $1, I wouldn't be interested.   Even if it is free, I'd rather put calories in my body that tasted decent.   Super disappointing.   The employee that helped me was very nice but I'm all about the food.   And this burrito is junk."}
{"text":"Seriously? 10 plus bucks for a dog food burrito. I sure hope their other places aren't this bad. Of course, I won't be eating here ever again. Ended up tossing the last 1/3 of the burrito...."}
{"text":"My kids and I frequent Moe's for the delicious and fresh food, quick and friendly service, and the fact that it's safe for my son who has a nut allergy. Everything has been safe for him except the prepackaged cookies. We all love the chips and queso and everything we've tried so far (tacos, burritos, salads, burrito bowls). You can't go wrong with Moe's!  And they even cater, which we'll consider for the future!"}
{"text":"The worst Moes location I've been to. They give you hardly any chips and the employees tend to have an attitude. The tables are always dirty and the counter where the salsa is kept is clearly never wiped down either. I love Moe's but will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"S/o to the crew for always making a tasty burrito. Moe's is the best bang for your buck in the area when it comes to burritos. The free chips and salsa is a great marketing tool for retention.  S/o to mgmt and staff for a laidback professional culture."}
{"text":"This place has terrible food.  I'm giving them 2 stars only because the people working there were friendly and helpful.  That's the only reason.    The food is totally bland, absolutely tasteless.  It's like lunchlady-style ground \"beef\" with no flavor (other than that weird, undefinable \"lunch lady\" flavor), the rice has no flavor, the corn tortilla has no flavor, the salsa has no flavor, nor the rice, the pico, and even the tortilla chips are without salt.  Ridiculous.  And it's not even particularly cheap.  Just really bad and really not mexican."}
{"text":"I am so glad my co-worker picked lunch today! I walked in not knowing what to do, the guys behind the counter were so helpful and I didn't feel rushed at all. They suggested their favorite choices and I was very pleased with my veggie salad. Vegetarian here! ? The restaurant was very clean and organized. The chips were an awesome bonus and the avocado salsa was very good."}
{"text":"My partner-in-crime's burrito obsession is still going strong (whyyyyyy?!?), so on a recent work related roadtrip I found myself in a fastfood mexiamerican joint once again.   Against better judgement, I added tofu as a protein to my burrito. Silly me, I thought this would be some faux chorizo, sofrito, or somewhat spiced crumb or something (anything! ) to fit with the 'Mexican' theme- but it's plain old cubed, silken tofu. Blegh. What the hey, people? Then again, it would compliment the mushrooms (!?) from the other end of the assembly line I guess. Tofu, mushrooms.... SMH.   Rice, black beans, tofu,  corn pico, cheese,  sour cream and guac with pickled jalapeños has got to be one of the most awful, bland things I've ever consumed. The actual burrito is wrapped in aluminum foil and manages to stick so badly to it that the thing ruptures at more than one occasion.   Free chips are nice if they'd be fresh and not stale. And please don't get me going on the salsa bar. This bar is the reason why I hate 'bars' of any kind; it's a sticky, disheveled,  gross mess.  And WHY can't I have salsa ON my burrito instead of on the side. Ugh. It would have helped the blandness for sure.  I think the employees working the shift I visited are allergic to smiling,  friendliness and cleanliness.   My husband said his burrito was alright,  which is code for eh, not the best.   PS the regular guac was green during my visit but the spicy guac was brown - ish. I was told it's because of the habanero powder they use to spice it up. Sounds like a valid argument but I stuck with the green kind juuuuust to be sure.."}
{"text":"Food is so good at a reasonable price.  Staff is very friendly and extremely helpful.  This will likely become our regular place."}
{"text":"Weak wanna be chipotle don't waste your money.  I got a chicken burrito it was about ten bucks maybe a Lil more and taste was not to good"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place but compared to Chipotle it isn't that great. I got a burrito bowl with chicken, rice, jalapeños, cheese, salsa, and sour cream. It tasted alright but I felt like there was barely anything in it... the queso didn't taste good and I had to get a refund for it. It's a nice place and the workers are friendly but it was disappointing and not for me. I'm loyal to Chipotle. Needless to say I will not be going back to Moe's!"}
{"text":"Every time we visit this restaurant we have had excellent food and service. The manager, Mike does an excellent job supervising this location. He and his staff is always very courteous and very friendly. This restaurant and location is defiantly worth the trip."}
{"text":"I was craving a burrito and i've been to longboards a few times so I decided to visit moe's.   It's a Moe's.  They greet you on entry with the signature \"Welcome to Moe's\" although much to my liking they aren't super loud in a meal disrupting way...or maybe I was lucky.  The food is very consistent from store to store so I wasn't blown away, but enjoyed the familiar...and got what I expected.  I had a burrito prepared the way i wanted in front of my eyes with nice crispy chips on the side.  I didn't try out their Freestyle coke machine but rather drank some so-called \"Northern Tea.\"  I don't really like that designation, but oh well."}
{"text":"Food is of mediocre quality and they got the takeout order wrong. They wanted me to come back after I'd already gotten home and are incapable of providing a refund without returning. The food's typical of a fast food Mexican chain and the personnel lack the basic skills you would expect in a food or customer service role. Would not recommend and will not return."}
{"text":"The food was surprisingly edible. I entered with zero expectations. Plain chicken quesadilla with rice and beans. But the price was unbelievable. For what should have cost around $9 I paid $20. Terminal 1 in McCarran airport has disgusting food alternatives. After roaming the Halls for about 50 minutes I finally decided on Moe's.  The saddest part of eating here is the tremendous amount of waste. Huge plastic containers to carry my food six feet from the counter to my table."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Chipotle. Their food tastes bland to me, from the vegetables to the rice. Enter Moe's to save the day! Not only do they offer vegetarians tofu, which is nice and crispy and seasoned, they have a nice selection of toppings to choose from. Grilled mushrooms, peppers, onions, several picos, plus olives, rice, cheese and so much more! Their sauces are awesome. Very flavorful and they work to enhance your food not cover the taste. Free chips with your order and free salsas. Super value! I only wish I had one closer."}
{"text":"Throwing a party on a budget (on your time and money)?  Moe's caters!  We found out Moe's caters through ezcater.com - For a $75 minimum, they delivered, in every sense of the word!   The food was on time, hot and packaged perfectly. With our catering order, Moe's included (at no extra charge) plates, utensils, napkins AND disposable food warmers!!  (The reason they get 4 stars instead of 5 is the fact that we originally did not get the warmers with the food, and learned you have to request them specifically)  The food was delicious and fresh and no one left hungry.  20 guests served, effortlessly, for under $200 - I dare someone to beat 'em.  Catering customer for life."}
{"text":"I would say this is a decent healthy alternative to fast food and at a pretty decent price point.  I had the Jon Coctostone quesadilla.  I was just ordering a snack because I didn't get much for lunch, but it was a bit more than just a snack.  I can't say that it is anything different than Chipotle Mexican Grille, or Qdoba.  It is pretty much the same thing with different menu items and happier food preps that say, \"Welcome to Moe's\" when you enter.  My quesadilla came with a big stack of tortilla chips on top.  The chips seem a bit odd placed on top of a sandwhich of sorts.  They are pretty bland by themselves and they need some salsa.  The randomly placed chips I don't get, but I guess it was a nice gesture.  Guacamole is ofcourse extra, but if you want to add any vegetables to your queso, burrito, or taco, you can do so with no added costs."}
{"text":"I always get student discount when I go there. Today the man on cashier did give me discount because he said I do not go to UNCC. I know I'm not a student in UNCC, but I'm still a student and many times I go to store I get the discount. The cashier was rode with me, and I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Tell me why when I'm hungover or still relatively drunk and woke up too early, a burrito just seems to be what I need?  AND why is airport food so damn expensive?  ESPECIALLY when it's not good.  I know now why as I was waiting for my flight back to SF, I saw so many people just settle with Burger King.  Smart people.    I should have followed what these people were doing, but nope, went and ordered me a \"homewrecker\" (nice name...not)  but it was just a regular burrito with suprisingly sour cream AND guacamole.  And for about $11 bucks, which I guess isn't bad too.  To be honest, I came here because I thought I'd get full for the amount I spent.  And so I did.     But there was something funky about this burrito.  The meat, which I got was steak, but it tasted sour.  I'm hoping it was lime juice or something that they cooked it with because it didn't seem very appetizing.   Secondly, they got a new batch of guacamole, and believe me, I absolutely LOVE guacamole, but I wouldn't be over doing it for a burrito.  It needs just the right amount.  BUT instead, when I got my burrito I could feel the center being cold because there was so much in there.  And worst of all, the guacamole I got was turning brown.  ANd yes I know that's what happens when guacamole is left out for a long time, and it means its fresh, but pleasE, don't let me see that.     Overall, its nothing great, just a good price for expensive food in the airports now."}
{"text":"While my food tasted good, the portion size of my salad was definitely smaller than the Washington, PA location. Only 5 pieces of meat in my salad, very little lettuce and no one asked me about salad dressing. Also staff not as friendly or competent as Washington. Don't know if I'll ever go back to this location even though it's closer to my home."}
{"text":"First time here!  Very friendly and helpful staff.  The menu is unique and has several exclusive choices that are reasonably priced across the board.  Salsa is great.  3 bites into it and had to write this review because it is extremely flavorful!  I wish there was a location near me in Akron..."}
{"text":"Welcome to Moe's, is the first thing you hear when you enter Moe's. The staff here are very friendly. You will get free chips and salsa with you're order. You can customize you're order."}
{"text":"So I ordered chips and queso. Menu shows a cup of queso with chips for 3.99 I got to the front to pay, they then charged me 4.99 for the cup of queso and then 3.49 for the chips! Very misleading and the girl working the register decided to clean the tables Instead of ringing in my order, that was annoying. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Visited Moe's for the first time in about a year for their birthday promo (Free Burrito w/ purchase of a large drink), and I have to say I was let down relative to my relatively mild expectations.  On a positive side, Moe's definitely has their lunch process nailed down to an efficient machine.  They pump people quick enough through the line that there's often a bottleneck and a battlefield at the open salsa station and drink stand.  Relative to the food, as many others have referenced, Moe's offers your typical Qdoba, Chipotle, etc. style build-your-own Mexican bar.  Being similarly priced to those options, the quality of Moe's ingredients simply doesn't compare and can best be described as bland at best.  The \"free\" chips with every meal (I hate these type of sales gimmicks) are honestly outgunned by your standard grocery store Tostidos fare.  I haven't tried the queso, so that may act as a saving grace.  With an abundance of great establishments downtown to grab lunch, Moe's just doesn't make a meaningful price/benefit argument."}
{"text":"Much improved over my last review. Also management has added a kids night on Wednesday. Kids eat free with paying adult meal. One free with each adult. Great deal for families!  Our grandkids loved their meals. Adults too. Good portion size and quality ingredients. So glad we have Moes in Vegas."}
{"text":"While the staff is helpful and nice, the food is so so. At the same price cafe rio gives more food and better taste. I will say however, some of the different salsas here are worth trying."}
{"text":"One of the workers always charge me for queso and does NOT charge the people in front or behind me for queso when I CLEARLY heard them ask for it in their burrito. He gives me minimal chips (less than a handful) and gives me a look when I order. Seems like he loves working there to satisfy customers. I hope he continues to work there and only charge me extra while everyone else gets free queso."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at this location, and I love that they have vegan-friendly options for my gentleman friend ;)   I just wish they were better at the \"welcome to moes\" statement. I've never heard it said enthusiastically or in unison like I've heard it at other locations."}
{"text":"My first time ever at a Moe's. It really was nothing special, it's like the Subway of burrito burrito places. I got The Homewrecker with STEAK. haha Hey April D!! Damn I wished I knew about their Facebook promotion.  I wanna say this wasn't my first time to a Moe's but I don't remember where or when. I literally saw a new business open while driving and went in. It was their 2nd or 3rd day open and they were ready for business. There was about 5 employees behind the counter, no line, everyone had smiles on their face, and said welcome and thank you all at once. They were friendly and answered whatever questions I had.  The burrito I got was more like something I would get from Qdobas. Everything on Moe's menu seems like you could get at Qdobas, burritos, bowl, salads, quesadilla, etc, and there happens to be one right across the street. I like Moe's selection of sauces more but the rest seems the same to me. Honestly for what it is, a fast food place, it's not bad I'd eat here again if I needed a bite plus if it's Monday you can't go wrong with any burrito or bowl for $5.99."}
{"text":"First time trying any Moe's. I wanted to do take out for the fam, so I tried to call ahead to place my order. We called (off & on) from 6:01 to 6:33, and no one answered. It wasn't constantly, the call will hang up after a certain amount of rings. We went from........ \"maybe they are busy\" (first 2 calls), to \"maybe they are closed\" on the 3rd call (we then checked), to (the last 6 - 10) minutes, me thinking, I am going to see if they answer before I can get there (they didn't).   When I got there, there were no customers and also no employees in site. I stood there for 2-4 minutes alone. A guy then came out from the back, looked up and was kinda shocked a customer had been waiting.  He quietly said, \"Welcome to Moe's\". I said, did you guy change your phone number or something? He said, no, it hasnt changed. I told him I had been calling for 30 minutes off and on and he said, \"Hmm I havent heard the phone ring. What can I get for you? Ok, so maybe they were having phone issues, I dont know. What I do know is we were not off to a good start.   About a minute into placing my order, another employee came from the back. He looked bored and tired too. He returned to the back a minute later. A minute or 2 after that, a 3rd employee (female) came from the back. It made me wonder........ at least 3 people working, and NO ONE was visible, manning the front when I came in? Did they ALL have to be in the back together for some reason? I dont know.   I guess this is standard in places like this, but I didnt like that I basically had to order 1 item at a time....... meaning, I'd order one thing, and walk them through it as they made it until that item was done, before I could order item #2 and so on....... That's good for accuracy, but the now 3 customers behind me didn't look happy about it. It took a while.  The food...... well it was actually decent. Not bad at all. No one complained about the taste, just the whole process of actually getting the food. :) Personally, my quesadilla was packed with cheese, but it kinda looked like they skimped on the meat in the steak bowl. i wasn't sure what the norm is because this was the 1st visit there. They have something like a mini salsa bar that will appear to some. I think its cool, but I dont eat salsa.   I didn't enjoy the experience, but the food was good. So they get a respectable 3 from me. I may try them again some time in the future if it is suggested, but the suggestion probably wont come from me. The whole \"fast serve casual\" Mexican food niche just isnt my thing."}
{"text":"Charged 8$ for my burrito on Monday (moe's Monday) and received 12 chips in my bag, yes 12 chips. I asked for more chips and was charged for a second bag (see picture for quantity of first bag). Definitely my first and last trip to this location."}
{"text":"One of the better Moe's. Relatively new it looks like and fairly clean   Beer selection is lacking key players (bud/bud light) but otherwise the food was good and experience was pretty good."}
{"text":"Went in for the Moe Monday special and was quite surprised at the lack of customer service... just a couple high schoolers and a manger who didn't care what was going on.  Waiting in an empty line for about 5 minutes and still wasn't greeted.  I requested 2 Moe Monday deals and was never asked what style tortilla I wanted... it was automatically the standard flour (which I can't have for medical reasons)...  When I was asked what I wanted on the homewreckers, I politely asked for the standard ingredients...  the young girl had to ask the manager what that was...  In turn, I was basically told \"This is like Chipotle, you can choose what you want. Even better, it's like Burger King - you can have it your way!\"  If I recall, the standard homewrecker is seasoned rice, black/pinto beans, shredded cheese, pico de Gallo, homemade guacamole, and your choice of protein...  Not hard, right?  Apparently it was...  I'll never go back and I'll be sure to tell everyone I know about my first, and last experience."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the Moe's in Toronto has permanently closed down.  The corporate office wouldn't say more than that.  The place was constantly packed at lunch and had awesome food so I can't imagine it was hurting for money.  Such a shame.  PS--The store in the photo is not the Moe's that this page is referring to."}
{"text":"Oh lord what a mistake. I should have known when the manager behind the food line greeted us with a tone of I hate my life and I hate his place so order and sit down.   My family of 5 adults and 1 infant happened upon moe's at lunchtime today. Upon looking at the menu we thought okay this is chipotle or quoba like which we all like very much. $59 later we sit down to eat and first impression was first of cold food, not just like warm but actually cold. The queso was so cold it had almost solidified. The nacho chips and taco salad bowl were severely stale and instead of going on and on I'll just tell you that this is simply awful food. I and the rest of my family will not return. Even if chipotle or quoba are 10 miles out of your way if this is the type of food you are looking for then it would be worth the drive vs eating here. Also, may I recommend la unica for great Mexican food!"}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood Moe's in Ballantyne Village. I come here about once a month and get the junior Art Vandalay (good option for a vegetarian). The service is always prompt and friendly. The place is usually pretty clean. No complaints. Good place to run in and grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"Tried Moes for the first time a couple weeks ago, after bugging my roommate to take me here for almost two years (he's taken everyone and their brother, long story).  Anyhow when I finally got there, it was a Monday afternoon, and while busy, there wasn't a long wait to get food or service.  I also found the food to have good flavor, and more options (that I liked) than Chipolte.  I also liked that they had at least 5 salsa flavors to choose from (I only liked two, but spicy and me are not friends), si tiy might like something else.  I found the workers to be very friendly and helpful, and I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Really has gone downhill. Chips had nasty taste from rancid oil. Chicken was very dry. Both types of rice looked as though they were cooked last week and was still sitting there. Last visit there."}
{"text":"Food was ass!!!!!! No flavor at all. Meat was dry and overcooked. Best part was  the mango habanero salsa....aside from that  taco bell would have been better."}
{"text":"Tired this place for the first time today, and today will be my last. Their food has absolutely no flavor! They should be embarrassed serving food like this! I contacted their corporate office and their level of customer service goes along with the poor quality of their food. Save yourself the money and eat somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"Well they got 2 out of 6 ingredients right on the tacos.   I ordered 2 tacos: Veggie, Soft Shell - Corn, Shredded Cheese, Shredded Cabbage, Cilantro, Lime, Avocado Lime Crema  I got 2 tacos, flour shell instead of corn, with shredded cheese, rice and cilantro. They were barely half an inch thick and just seemed pointless.   I also got a small side of rice, beans and queso & they were fine, no real way to mess that up. I'm not sure why I paid $18 tipping 20% to people who acted appalled (yelling \"she's here???\") that I would show up at the pickup time I was given upon placing the order. So loud, so incompetent. If I hadn't already paid I would have simply went elsewhere."}
{"text":"Huge portions, salsa bar, cheap and the staff is friendly.  I didn't particularly care for the taste... I like Chipotle's spice style and this one tasted bland to me.  I had the Overachiever taco combo with steak and all the fixin's... the steak totally ruined it for me.  I was wishing I got a vegetarian one, but I tried my partner's chicken on her club nachos and the chicken was good.  For someone who doesn't eat a lot, don't get the overachiever combo unless you plan on saving some for later."}
{"text":"Decent food but small portions. Not very generous for the price. They seemed to want to rush me through and up-charge me for additional menu items rather than give me a good value for the nine dollars I was already paying for a burrito bowl. One bonus of eating here...the salsas are outstanding!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness there is finally a Moes here!! Maybe wait a few weeks until they get their system together. The wait was substantial for only a few people.  I hope it gets faster because I do like this place!"}
{"text":"This Moe's is like all other Moe's I have eaten at, which is to say it's standard at best.  I prefer Chipotle and Salsarita's to Moe's and Qdoba. Positives: This location is large plus they do have the salsa bar.  But honestly their salsas pale in comparison to Chipotle's.  Also, my kids love Moe's for some reason, so maybe its just me  Negatives: the burrito (naked in my case) was just so bland.  And that's a huge negative. In fact that's all I need to know. Two stars."}
{"text":"Located in an outdoor mall this Moe's is pretty decent.  The food is made fast and right every time.  Never over done or sloppy the food is pretty good.  I always enjoy a good JC.    Beer is avaiable.  The bathrooms are clean and the overall appearance and cleanliness is above average.  I dont eat fast food much but this is a decent alternative."}
{"text":"Went to Moe's in DT Summerlin at 6:30 pm, prime dinner time, on a weeknight. We were the ONLY customers in the place. The set up is similar to other fast food Mexican places except the food is not fresh! Probably because they have no customers. So, the food just sits and sits. They had everything wrapped in saran wrap and it had clearly been sitting around for hours. My burrito was gross. I couldn't eat it. Pass."}
{"text":"Moes! Why did you leave?  I wanted a tasty burrito and you were gone! I can't believe you left me without saying goodbye, or at least leaving me a note (and a burrito.)"}
{"text":"The employees at this location are incredibly rude. The rice is always hard and the veggies are always mushy. Not a pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Save ur money .. go to chipotle .. wasnt verry appealing at all so i gave it a try.. not the best burrito but hey the people that work inside is friendly.."}
{"text":"The food never tastes fresh and the works never seem to want to be there. The one is Ballantyne is much better. This one is just more convenient bc it's so close to home."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say that this was my final time trying this location in hopes that it had some how turned around.  I frequently notice dirty tables and floors, poor customer service, and a lack of keeping up with stocking things like cutlery, lids, salsa, exc.   Today was the worst yet. Horrible customer service,  my food is not edible( rice is literally crunchy and beans taste like cardboard), and the whole place needs a good cleaning, but the icing on the cake was the employee at the register trying to avoid bugs.... why are there bugs where food is served? Totally grossed out and finding a new burrito place. I think there is a new Chipotle across the street. Adios Moe's."}
{"text":"Just average food... In between a chipotle and zabas.. The staff is welcoming, but it's pretty pricey for an average bowl. Only white rice and cabbage style lettuce."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try out Moe's for some time now so when I saw they were offering a groupon I knew it was my chance to give them a try. My husband and I went in on Friday night for dinner and like some of the other reviews we were confused by the menu. Almost immediately I was concerned about my decision of choosing Moe's. There was only 1 person working; she had 3 customers ahead of us and not only was she making the food but also working the register. I looked down the line of food and the place was a mess. When it finally came our turn to order we were advised that they were out of rice. We were disappointed but not completely turned off and decided to come back at a later date. The following Monday my husband and I returned to redeem our groupon. Up front I told the employee that I was there to use my groupon.  I was a bit nervous as my bowl was being assembled; clumpy rice, strange film on the beans, barely enough chicken, white not green lettuce and to top it off a scoop of sour cream which was scrapped from the bottom of the container.  When I got to the register and presented my groupon I was then told by the second employee that I can't use my groupon on Monday because of their $5.99 Monday burrito special. I then said I would pay full price just so I could use the groupon. After some back and forth discussion, where I filled him in on the rice issue from Friday night it was clear to me that they weren't going to accept the groupon. I told the employee that I would not be purchasing the food, that I would be canceling my groupon order and that I would never step foot in that restaurant again. He looked at me and said OK. How's that for customer service?"}
{"text":"This is a decent Moe's - \"A-OK,\" just as Yelp describes a 3-star rating.  If you've been to Moe's, you know the menu.  I'm a fan.  The food here is fresh, everything is made-to-order, and I like it.  Beyond that, this location is a bit tight inside, tighter than your typical Moe's.  They do have some out-door seating here, which is a nice option.  Beyond that, it's not that special, so again, nothing wrong here at all, a solid 3-star location."}
{"text":"I love Moes as a business, but they have GOT to do a clean slate of the employees that work here. Specifically, 2 of the \"women\" (because they are definitely not ladies) that work there are by far the rudest employees I've ever encountered. It's amazing they still have jobs. They are lazy, clearly hate their jobs, and their sarcasm is so inappropriate (joking that they weren't going to serve me one day). I wish I knew their names but they never have name tags on. I've witnessed them lie to other customers, talk shit about customers and I've never in my life witnessed SLOWER service, it's like they are doing it on purpose. Miserable atmosphere. Everything everyone else is saying is correct. I'm a regular customer but I'll never go back."}
{"text":"My new rice bowl spot!  Their rice is moist and flavorful. And not the traditional small grain. Very filling with a variety of toppings. Chips and salsa complimentary with purchase."}
{"text":"Moe's would get five stars, but they don't because I think we should be able to have queso body shots.  This is epicenter of course full of drunken adults and young adults so going in on a Friday or Saturday night is always entertaining.  Whats good is the staff knows everyone is tore up and they just ride with it.  They are always super talkative and it makes the time fly when you are waiting for that delicious queso. $7 dollars gets you out the door with a drink, chips + queso, and quesadilla.  You will the wake up in the morning and wonder why you feel like garbage, but it will all make sense when you find the Moe's receipt in your pocket.  PS Queso"}
{"text":"I found the menu confusing and when I settled on an option it didn't seem like there was a rhyme or reason to the flow the employee took me down afterwards. Big empty restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre employees friendly enough Huge dining room just no one to fill it. The thing that had my stomach turning was a terrible stinch coming from around the drink machine.  I don't know what it was but really turned me off!  I definitely won't be itching to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Sadly, this Moe's is on a slight downward trajectory.  I've been here many times over the last four years or so.  To be clear, to food is still pretty good.  But it's messy.  Not just in the dining area, but if you LOOK at the counter where they make your food, it's a bit gross.  It just needs to be cleaned.  Just wipe down those cutting boards and get the yellow cheese drips out of the black beans vat, please.  Next, my burritos aren't made very well.  Want guacamole?  Okay, you'll get a small scoop right in the center of your rito.  So when you eat it, most has zero guac., but one bite is 100% guac.  If I knew how to re-wrap it, I'd unwrap it and spread the stuff around, but that doesn't really work."}
{"text":"Meh. That's all I need to say. Basically upon entering I was greeted by an uneventful \"Welcome to Moe's \" which seemed more like a warning than a welcome. The staff seemed unable to speak coherent English so they seemed to put their best representative at the \"Order Here\" starter point. Mind you, none of the staff were remotely Mexican. After putting my order through I suddenly came over with the feeling of regret as I swear I recognized the staff who had worked down the road at Sonics (read my write up). As I went through the order process picking toppings, the workers seemed to change with each topping! I swear for each topping! It's like they were only able to train each staff to do one topping. And as I neared the cash registered, the English got worse. So that's the workers. Now on to the food.   When I got home I opened a bag and noticed they just threw in chips on the bottom of my bag and laid the burrito, wrapped in foil, on the chips. One of the Salsa has opened and wicked through the bag. It reminded me of a prison made brown bag lunch!! Thrown together. The rice had no flavor and over cooked with too much liquid. Sticky. The ingredients were not fresh and lacked flavor. The carnitas was not carnitas but pork with salt and pepper. I was amazed at how this placed is showing 4 stars. The food was utterly garbage. I will never go back and give this place maybe 2 years before it's made into a Check And A Go. Shameful."}
{"text":"Average food for high prices. I would have given it a 2 star but the queso saved it. The staff aren't the most friendly, not necessarily rude but lazy and don't even try to hide the fact that they don't want to be there.  The tables were filthy and two trashcans were literally overflowing to the point that you couldn't fit anything else in and trash was falling to the floor. The staff just stood around talking to eachother."}
{"text":"Love coming here, especially for moe's Monday. Burrito and drink for $5.99 plus unlimited chips and salsa. The staff is always super friendly, there are a lot more options to choose from to add into your burrito compared to chipotle and Qdoba. I would definitely recommend getting queso added to your meal, definitely makes it much better!"}
{"text":"The food is not bad. However, the service I received here was terrible. When I walked up to the counter to order, the first thing the employee (which I later found out was the general manager) said was, \"isn't it time for a haircut, buddy?\" Now, this is nothing new to me-amongst friends. As he was making my burrito, I told him that I was growing my hair out for Locks of Love, but he continued to make remarks on how I should get it cut and how it looks bad. This was unacceptable, especially from a general manager. I will never be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I really want to like Moe's but I don't think I can. I've eaten here about four times. All in the late afternoon/evenings. There are never enough staff to make the food and they are always 'out' of something. Today was the final straw. They were out of the flour salad bowls, so I got a regular bowl. The rice was hard and crunchy, I skipped on the beans after the customer in front of me ordered them and they had a thick line of crust around the container from sitting so long, they were also out of grilled onions. They did offer to make new grilled onions, which they did and they placed them right back in the same dirty container.  The chicken that they had was the last of it, and she scooped it in and said \"That's almost a full order of chicken\". Then we got to the cold section, where they were basically out of sour cream. Now I'm sure they had more, the girl asked someone to get more, but it never came. So I accepted the fact that I got a half order of sour cream. When I got over to the salsa bar, the poor salsa suffered from the same issue as the beans. Just a large thick ring of dried up salsa on the sides.   As we were eating, a small child, no more than 3 years old emerges from the double doors that are the kitchen and starts running around by where the sad food is peeped into whatever you order. His mother apparently worked there and he was with her at work. I watched him climb across a table and then go sit on the dirty floor under the same table to proudly get up and walk back to the food prep area.   The rice was hard and crunchy, the chicken was DRY (and I like dry chicken, but I couldn't even stomach it), and everything was cold.   Hopefully the health district comes and visits them so they serve some hot non crusted food."}
{"text":"Worst Burritos ever.  I come from Mission in SF so my bar is high.  Still I think it's not a edible burrito what they serve here.  AT your own risk."}
{"text":"Very basic burrito, the quality of everything was low. The chips are not even good. It wasn't terrible just there are other places to get a burrito that is much better"}
{"text":"I never go to moes. Always chipotle but wanted to give it a try and wanted a chicken quesadilla. 830 was told that they already cleaned the grills and can't make me one !!!??  But you close at 9!??  Are you kidding me.  Oh and by the way you looked irritated that I came in at all.  The staff just wanted to go home. Wednesday night 04/18.   That's why I will continue to give chipotle my business."}
{"text":"This was the only place open when I arrived in Charlotte late that night.  I was thankful just to find something after walking around the area for a while since I wasn't given a car...   The experience is similar to a Chipolte, if you're not from the area. They did have tofu and other options you don't normally see in chain of this nature. The food was ok. I was amused by the fact they had Southern (sweet) tea and Northern (non-sweetened) tea. I guess the war between north and south continues!   They gave me a huge bag of chips with my meal.  It may have been because they were closing but I never did finish it all off. In fact, I think most of them ended up being thrown out.   Overall, if you're looking for something that can be relatively healthy and vegetarian and nothing else is open, check this place out."}
{"text":"I like that Moe's gives you a free meal on your Birthday, if you sign up on their website.  I have taken advantage of this twice now, but the last time I went to Moe's was for lunch with a co-worker so I had to fork over some cash.   I opted for three chicken tacos.  I changed up the typical pico de gallo they usually put on with the corn salsa, and added jalapenos, onion, and cilantro.  It was lunch and they were busy, which left some of the workers appearing overwhelmed and not too pleasant.  The lady that rang me up didn't say thank you or welcome to when I said thank you.  That pisses me off.  You're in a customer service role, so be pleasant especially since I was being pleasant and said \"thank you\" to her for my meal.    So my three tacos were a bit on the small side for the price.  I watched the creation of my tacos, only one little scoop of chicken landed in each taco.  The tacos were tasty, all the ingredients were fresh and satisfying, but I was a bit bummed that they weren't hot.  I want a hot taco, not room temp tacos.    Anyhow you get free chips and salsa, with a nice variety of choices at the salsa bar, and you can get free refills on the chips.  And their queso is simply wonderful.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Food was good, don't go here unless you want the employees and manager to treat you like shit. Doesn't matter if you are nice to them."}
{"text":"The food was ok. We ate at the airport one before departing. The price like everything else in the airport really expensive."}
{"text":"Like they say \"you only get one chance to make a first impression\". Not impressed with my first visit to Moe's. I felt the menu was a little confusing with names and references of popular culture to identify food offerings with no ingredient description.  I think they missed the mark. One example was the \"Art Vandalay\".  I love the show Seinfeld but how does that tell me what is in the burrito? Could it be latex? Definitely not, so I'm not sure where they were going with that one.    The staff were definitely new and could have used the more guidance from the MOD who had better things to do on his cellphone while at the register not to mention the personality of a brick wall.    I chose the burrito this visit and an Art Vandalay which seemed to end up as half a burrito because of the small size.  All items are sitting in hot and cold well pans and you go down the line and choose your toppings.   I had the steak which was a little chewy for sitting in the well to long maybe?   Moe's offers a combo of $2.89 add on which includes a drink and a choice of side.  I went with Moe's famous Queso dip which for 2 Oz goes for $1+ by itself.  That's crazy I thought.  They do offer a salsa bar with 5 or 6 types varying in spice level. I tried several and none of which tantalized my taste buds.  Warm tortilla chips do come with your burrito which is a nice touch.  This location had some opportunities to improve guest service and enhance the experience.  2/3 of the staff kept dissappearing to the back and leaving the newest guy out front to handle several guests for lunch rush. I saw 3 people leave after waiting several minutes and no one acknowledged them.  The one guy who looked like he was supposed to be in charge obviously had no interest in being at work today by his lack of engaging with the people who pay his salary.   I had high expectations of Moe's from an episode of Undercover Boss. The food looked awesome and the concept seemed great. However I think the BOSS needs to make a few more visits or this concept will sink in Downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"Good food but unbelievably slow   Waited in a line of five people for 20 minutes   Seems like their internet orders are more important than their in store customers"}
{"text":"I've seen monkey s**t fights at the zoo that were more organized than this place.   The food was average at best, although I frequent the other Moe's locations in the Charlotte-metro area and they are all very good. I think the General Manager, Aimee, either forgot her meds or just hates life in general... she was rude and acted like I was a burden on her day. The staff didn't know half of the menu items and they sure didn't know how to make my nachos. Did I forget to mention that they are slow? From the time I walked in until I paid took right under 10 minutes, and this was 4pm in the afternoon with a total of 6 people in line. But if I ever have the desire to score some primo weed, all I need to do is just talk to the guy who cleans the tables there since he wasn't shy nor quiet about talking to his fellow employees about his supply.  So if you are considering eating at Moes in Gastonia, Id either: (A) walk next door to Flip Flops and eat or (B) drive down the street to Qdoba."}
{"text":"I was expecting someone to say welcome to Moe's cause I saw it on TV on undercover boss. Guess, every store is different though I did get a welcome to Moe's when I was in New York City.  The guy who took order said hi and hello as we placed our orders. The other guy just asked what topping we wanted and third guy rang us up. The home wrecker steak was warm. The chips were fresh and all the salsa you can yourself to."}
{"text":"It's typical airport food. I would skip next. I had chipsand guacamole. Husband had burrito. He said he would pass next time, or get Burger King."}
{"text":"In a city without a chipotle or a decent local burrito joint, Moes would reign supreme. Unfortunately this Moes just isn't up to par.  I've been here 3 times and each time it's just been underwhelming. My burritos are always devoid of a decent amount of meat or even beans (I've seen them remove pieces of meat that they've added since it was evidently \"too much\")  The chips here just seem off compared to other Moes in the area. Some are soft and chewy as if they fished them out before they were ready.  Maybe it's because I come after a lunch crowd, but the salsa bar is always empty in some containers.  In a city full of amazing local joints, you'd think the chain places would try to keep up, but this place just seems content in going through the motions."}
{"text":"First let me start out by saying that the only reason I went here was that I got a free entree coupon and this particular Moe's was the closest to my office.   Unfortunately this Moe's has the worst customer service and it's not the first time I've experienced it here.   On this particular visit I came in with a free entree coupon for my birthday and walked up to the counter where the first employee just stared at me and said nothing. That's not that unusual, but maybe a 'Hi' or 'What will you have' would be a good ice breaker, I don't want to micromanage or anything. So I told her what I wanted and moved down the line. Then I get to the cash register to present my coupon. The lady working the register was about as welcoming as the guards at Gitmo. No smile no nothing. She's waited on me before and she has zero customer service skills. So I presented the coupon that clearly states at the top 'Happy Birthday' and of course a normal response from this lady would have been 'Happy birthday' or something similar, again I don't want to micromanage. She acted as if I walked into her house at 3am and asked her to make me lunch.   Now let me say that I don't expect these people serving me to kiss my butt or anything but how about a little smile or something to let me know you have a pulse? It's not like the food is that great either or there aren't a million other Tex Mex places with the same business model. But lack luster food and rude employees is a recipe for disaster. And this is the same industry demanding $15 an hour?!! Are you kidding me? I remember working these jobs when I was younger and I at least made an effort especially when the customer is nice and says please and thank you. Maybe mirror the customer's attitude or if you're so miserable, find a job where the dead-eyed, no customer service, crappy attitude, zero personality is considered an asset...like the TSA."}
{"text":"It's Moe's.  It's a \"chain\" restaurant.  It's what you'd expect.   Starting with the friendly, welcoming greeting when you enter, you get to meander to the line and order your food, pick your toppings, etc. and then, shortly thereafter, enjoy your food - whether it be a burrito, taco, or the like.    This is a quick-fix Mexican-ish food stop that's great for those times when you're running errands, coming to and from somewhere or something, or just want a fast meal.    Welcome to Moe's!!"}
{"text":"Not too impressed with Moe's it was all sour cream and rice!!  Was here on a Sunday afternoon and wasn't even busy!!! Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Best fast casual mexican place in the game. Love their queso and chips - chicken and hot sauce are also very tasty. I go to Moe's whenever I am in an area that has one. Went to this location a few times on a recent trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"I love Moe's, but this location was a huge letdown. I requested the hot sauce on my tacos and was told it was no longer offered by Moe's. I later confirmed its availability at multiple east coast locations. I actually still think I got ripped off. Everyone expects to pay more for airport food, but I was told that EACH TACO was $8.59. So, my meal ended up costing over $20 for two soft tacos, chips, queso and a drink. Like I said, I love this place, so I paid for it.   I would suggest staying away from this venue on your next trip to LAS. You won't have to wait long for your next opportunity to get ripped off, namely by a Taxi company. There's also a strong likelihood that this place will be closed when you read my review because, well, all Moe's are closing and it's only a matter of time before the company is the Mexican equivalent of Quiznos (loved that place too RIP)."}
{"text":"Probably some of the worst tex mex I've ever had. Being a chipotle and looking for a change, I was seriously disappointed. I was immediately reminded of subway when I saw the setup. I ordered 3 tacos, 2 steak and 1 chicken. I actually paid paid extra for brown guacamole. The steak was anything but steak and the chicken was just lousy. My toppings immediately sogged up my tacos and made them almost impossible to eat without a fork. shouldn't have happened since all I had was lettuce, sour cream, pico de gallo and a small amount of guacamole ( in a hard shell) I tried everyone of their 5 salsas and I can honestly say I hated every one. The whole time I wishing I had gone to chipotle. The prices are outrageous for the quality. I guess the horrible food was the reason we were the only ones in there at lunch time. If your hungry and want quick Mexican or tex mex chipotle or even taco bell would be better."}
{"text":"Welcome to Moe's ! Friendly staff, fresh food everything is soooo tasty.. Free chips and salsa with any order. What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Why does just about everything in Ayrsley suck when compared to other locations?  Is this development built on some cursed grave site?  The Portofino's is easily the worst of any in the area, the Wild Wing has been shut down twice for serving alcohol to minors and also received some pretty bad inspections scores, and now Moe's is probably the worst of any in the area.    Every Monday is Moe Monday at all Charlotte area locations.  $5 gets you any burrito, chips, and a drink.  Last Monday, we went to Moe's in Ballantyne and were served very healthy burritos, a huge portion of chips, and made our drinks at the Coca Cola freestyle machine.  That Moe's was very busy.  Today I go to Moe's at Ayrsley and received two burritos that were skimpy on the meat and barely a handful of chips, plus no freestyle Coke machine.  I guess that explains why there was only one other customer in the place.  This isn't the first time we have have been less than satisfied at this location, and we have been to several others from north Charlotte to Rock Hilll.  If you're craving Moe's, go to a different one than Ayrsley."}
{"text":"I have ordered Moe's a few times on their regular priced nights now.  They definitely skimp on the ingredients on the special days, including Moe Monday and more recently National Earmuff Day.  They even skimped on black olives for that but also really skimped on the guac and sour cream.  Your product should be consistent (especially in a franchise), whether or not it's a day where a discount is offered."}
{"text":"Skimpy on the ingredients lately."}
{"text":"EW.  I had their tacos and it was by far the nastiest tacos I've ever had to this date. The chicken was so dry and bland. The steak had a bit more flavor but she took spoonfuls of guacamole and sour cream and everything else just made this taco more like a throw up inside a tortilla. Im just glad I got the drink, I really did like my raspberry tea."}
{"text":"Went today, shoutout to the girl who was wrapping my burrito and decided to announce how sick she was and thought it was funny. DISGUSTING. Thoroughly upset with quality of food and service ... Poor job moes"}
{"text":"Took my Co worker to Moe's for lunch and was very disappointed. When we walked into the restaurant we were not greeted with the traditional \"Welcome to Moe's\". My Co worker ordered a salad and I ordered the earmuffs with chicken. When we sat down to eat my Co worker noticed that her lettuce was brown on the edges and had some brown slime on the leaves. She returned her salad and received a burrito instead. The food was bland and the rice was cold. The salsa and chips were not very tasty. The queso cheese was watery and the pickled jalapeños were not spicy at all. Needless to say we will not be returning to this location any time soon."}
{"text":"I was  very pleasantly surprised by this place!  It was so good we went twice in one week!  Great food & atmosphere and friendly employees!"}
{"text":"I love moes over chipotle. First of they welcome and greet everyone as you walk in the door. It really does make you feel welcome.  They have way more options then chipotle and you get chips and salsa with your meal for free ! Once you sit down they also have different types of salsa's to taste with your chips. Great added touch !!!  The next best thing about this place is the awesome drink machine. You can make so many different types of soft drinks with the beverage machine !  Total family friendly place !"}
{"text":"Welcome to Moe's!  Since I moved from south Charlotte some years ago, my random Moe's cravings would only be satisfied while on one of my few and far between jaunts through Dilworth.  And even those were sometimes handicapped with the shootings that closed it from time to time.  So when I saw last week that they were opening one at the Epicentre (GO SIT IN THE CORNER!), I knew I was going to venture over for lunchtime goodness.  The place is still new and there was a line around almost the entire interior of the restaurant.  This lead to about a 15 minute wait for me to place my order for a Joey Bag of Donuts (I usually go with a Homewrecker).  I think my order was transformed to a Homewrecker since the only real difference is the cost of sour cream and guacamole.  It was just as tasty as I remembered.  Fresh-ish ingredients, good amount of steak, slightest tinge of spice to their guac.  It was a semi-register friendly meal, too.  With a side of queso and a drink only ran me a touch over eight pesos, making it one of my cheaper lunchtime, uptown meals.   There IS a bottleneck after check out though.  This revolutionary soda machine is baffling to some.  Boasting 100 flavor combinations, its an all in one Coke machine.  With only one spout.  So if someone is perplexed by the five different flavored Coke combos, you can get a logjam, quick.  I went with a regular Coke, raspberry Coke, cherry Coke combo that wasn't too shabby, and the future diabetics of Charlotte would look back on such a drink fondly.  Seating is an okay mix of two tops, four tops, booths and bar along the windows.  Once the excitement of being new wears off, this will be easier to deal with..."}
{"text":"Excellent food - heathy and a nice clean place with smart young attentive staff. If you want a fast clean place to eat this is it."}
{"text":"Okay I gave this Moe's (2) stars because the burrito was truly delicious. That's the good part. To begin the rest of this short story, my friend I was with had never been to Moe's. We walk in. The burrito-stas looked at us, no words. No \"Welcome to Moe's\". I've never seen anything like it!! Then they asked us if we wanted chips!? Yes is that a question? I feel like I normally get more than I want. Anyway, we told my friend to forget that experience and we will go to another Moe's."}
{"text":"I havent been to a moes in a couple years and was out south park and seen one had opened up. Went in and was greeted kindly..kid making the food was super helpful in answering questions. ..the food was.made quick and was tasty. They were out of the salsa i wanted on the salsa bar but were very quick to refil when i asked and were even.polite about it.   My favorite part of this experience was that the workers were using good hygiene practices and not scratching their face, head, skin etc. Which happens in most faster food places. When i see that, i immediately leave. I liked whst i saw here and will be back"}
{"text":"First and last visit!   No one spoke when I walked in. The bathroom had no soap or towels. When I ordered food and paid no thanks or have a good day.  I sat and watched other people come and go the employees never smiled.  Very depressing experience and sanitary code was low.  I would never go back to this location.  Sad because this is a very busy and growing area.  They could make a fortune here!!!"}
{"text":"If it was possible to give this location zero stars, I absolutely would. I chose to dine here twice within the past month, and I sincerely regret going there both times (the second time due to the food poisoning).   The first visit the store was completely empty (no customers and only a single employee barely visible in the back room); what was left of the food had been covered up and had clearly been sitting for some time even though they were supposed to be open for a few more hours. The food tasted borderline acceptable, but was room temperature and ended up making me and my coworkers feel less than great for the rest of the night (we chalked it up to the quantity as opposed to the quality; a mistake on our part).   The second time I ate there... the horror! It was the WORST case of food poisoning I have ever had in my life. For 48 full hours, Moe's Southwest had its way with my intestines after laying claim to and evicting the entire contents of my stomach several hours after eating it. The second visit was made in the middle of the day in the middle of the week for lunch, and the location was still completely empty with all the food covered up and sitting and no visible employees upon entrance, much like the original visit some weeks earlier.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS."}
{"text":"Food is bland. Place is dirty.  Unclean counters.  It wasn't busy, less than 12 customers, and they had 8 employees behind the counter.  Floor was unswept, all tables were dirty and both customer trash cans were overflowing.  We watches several employees walk past the trash cans to refill their drink cups, ignoring the filth all around"}
{"text":"Excellent staff and customer service. Great food. ***Beware** All locations are now serving dark meat chicken in place of the white meat chicken. Totally changes the taste. I feel this is not a good idea and it may decrease business."}
{"text":"This place is usually pretty reliable for a quick bite when everything else is packed but it's never my first choice. Stopped by today at request of our teenage girls.   Normally service is okay and place is clean as was the case today, Sunday, after the lunch rush. I like their pulled chicken burrito and chips. Like all such places,  it can be hit or miss though..."}
{"text":"First time going to Moe's. I went solely based off of seeing it on Undercover Boss. Their menu is very diverse. I ended up ordering the chicken quesadilla. It was very good. A little pricey, but good.   They were consistent with saying \"welcome to Moe's\" every time someone walk through the door. At times it did lack energy. But personally, if I work there I would get tired of saying it myself.  Overall good experience."}
{"text":"I've ended up at Moe's a few times now and I think it is a half decent choice in the Westgate City Center.  It has the Chipotle/Baja Fresh feel to it..  The chicken is of better quality than Chipotle's which is a nice change.  This is a quicker option than the sea of sit-down restaurants in Westgate (Which Wich is also a nearby option).  The service was great on my first visit and not so fabulous on the second.  So, I guess that means it is hit or miss as far as I am concerned.  They have silly names for their menu items like Joey Bag of Donuts, etc.  The chips are free and they have a pretty good salsa bar-lots of mild and hotter options.  If I happen to find myself at Westgate, I'd say this is one of the better options for something quick and acceptable."}
{"text":"Welcome to Moe's.  They are very nice here.  I wanted to get a bottled water with fizz in it and I had already bought a simple flat bottled water.  The guy at the register said don't worry about it and swapped it out.  I offered to pay the difference but he said it was alright.  That is service.  He wanted me to feel comfortable and was willing to let $.30 or so slide.  I always get the home-wrecker because it is two meals for me.  I get it all the way.  I get so much stuff in it they can hardly wrap it up.  If you really want to go nuts you get a burrito bowl version of the home-wrecker and that way they can give you more toppings than you could ever fit in a tortilla.  Moe's seems to have employees that are cooler than at fast food restaurants.  They also don't try to hurry you to the next station like at Chipotle.  When you ask for extra of something they will double it, not just give you a tad more.  I like that about Moe's.  This location can be tricky when it comes to parking since I usually park behind it and walk up.  The parking is fine but if you want that lazy 10ft from the door experience you won't get it."}
{"text":"Their burritos are so good, I haven't gone one school break in two years without eating them.  Oh, and when I lived in Arlington, VA last summer, I drove 10 miles just to go to the closest Moe's!"}
{"text":"Always clean. Fast service I order online to avoid any lines. Good amount of food for the price . Coke freestyle machine if you get a drink. Funny to hear them shout Welcome to Moe's with such enthusiasm."}
{"text":"Yes, it's just a Moe's but it's a great  location and the service is great the food is fresh and its kept squeaky clean! So yes, I'm a huge fan."}
{"text":"Apparently  this is  the original version of Chipotle and Zabas type eateries.   This was my first and unless every other place like this ( Cafe Rio, Zabas, Chipotle etc) in town closes down; this will be my last visit. Ok. Let me take that back... Even if they all close down I feel comfortable saying I'm never willingly coming back.   The place was empty so maybe the food that they prepped dried and withered while waiting on customers?  All I know is that the portions were small and flavorless.  The staff was less than enthusiastic and the place was dirty.     Maybe the weekend staff is not up to par and  hopefully this wasn't their best day.   Hopefully your experience is better."}
{"text":"Not the best visit at this location. Staff was rude and unprofessional. The lady manger was sitt in the lobby area loud as ever speaking to employees about up coming scheduled. The guy who fixed my food was very unpleasant. I asked if I could taste the beef before I got it. He said if I buy it. What the What.... got my food and told him to have a great week he said nothing back. My food was ok... done with this location. I will get my Moe's from Northlake Location"}
{"text":"Love the queso here! The Stack is awesome but it's huge. They take two round crunchy shells fill it with what you want and than put a soft burrito shell around it! The burritos are great as well but be careful they can get large. I also like that they have white or wheat shells for everything! They have great ingredients to choose from that are fresh! They also have some bottles if beer as well."}
{"text":"Of all the fast-burrito chains, Moe's is definitely my favorite.  Sorry, Chipotle and QDoba.  Their ingredients always taste the freshest to me, plus they offer a few items their competitors don't (pickled OR diced fresh jalapeños?  yes please!).  I like that you can get a junior-sized burrito if you don't want a gigantic portion.  On the other hand, if you do want a gigantic portion, the Wrong Doug Stack adds corn tortilla structural integrity to the cheesy goodness of a quesadilla, and if you're not counting calories, it's delicious.  Other perks of Moe's include a self-serve salsa bar, delicious guac and queso, and the fact that everything comes with chips.  Prices are reasonable-- they're cheaper than their rivals when you remember chips and salsa are included for free.  You get enthusiastically welcomed to Moe's at every location, but this one has some of the friendliest employees I've ever encountered.  I'm sure I'll be a regular.  Welcome to the neighborhood, Moe's!"}
{"text":"Ever wonder if the employees get tired of saying \"Welcome to Moe's\"?  If you don't know what I mean and you're not familiar with Moe's, it's a burrito chain a la Chipotle and QDoba, but it might actually be my favorite of the three.  This location lived up to my expectations based on others.  The ingredients always taste fresh.  I love that you can get a smaller size \"junior burrito,\" which is still pretty big, to be honest.  My husband is a fan of the stacks, which are like a quesadilla meets a burrito but with structural integrity provided by a crispy tortilla in the middle.  They offer some toppings that their competitors don't, like fresh jalapeños and cilantro.  Guacamole is included in the price of whatever you order, which is always a perk.  So are chips!  And access to a salsa bar (I kind of wish I could get the salsa put into my burrito, but this negative is canceled out by the free chips).  Their queso isn't the most flavorful I've ever had, but it's addictive regardless.  Employees are friendly, parking is free, and burritos are predictably affordable and tasty.  Go get welcomed to Moe's if you find yourself hungry in Mentor."}
{"text":"I got welcomed to Moe's for my first time yesterday, and while it wasn't my favorite burrito I've ever had, it's a solid choice for a quick meal.  Their menu is kind of confusing, and I have no idea what type of burrito I actually ended up with, but I like that they had small and large options.  I liked the chicken better than QDoba's but not as much as Chipotle's.  QDoba wins the battle in terms of queso,  but Moe's might win in terms of toppings, by virtue of having more of them-- fresh jalapeños are definitely a nice touch if you want to add a little bit of a kick.  The salsa bar is nice, especially the green mango salsa, but I do wish they had an option that was hotter than medium but milder than habanero.  And of course, I'll never complain about a meal that comes with free chips and salsa.  The line moved fast, service was friendly, the restaurant was clean, and there's outdoor seating.  Combine that with a decent burrito and you have a good place  for a $10 lunch."}
{"text":"I have to say I love food, especially American-Mexican burritos, just not here.   I got the Joey with organic tofu and the make your own subway style burrito build. I have to say I was highly unimpressed with the quality of the ingredients and the freshness of the veggies. I thought the entire burrito felt fake.  The one plus though that allowed me to give this place 3 stars was the salsa bar! OMG... the pineapple salsa was so good, I suggest you do try that if you do end up here.   Also the coke machine is one of those freestyle machines so you can mix and match and make your own fun new concoctions.   Overall I will not go back, but if I am forced I'll stick to the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Moe's - used to be a good alternative to fast food, now the food seems a little on the bland side with the flavors kind of washed out and they seem to be heavy on rice and short on the protein with less beans and less meat.  Overall though, still a good place to go for that quick lunch option every now and then."}
{"text":"First visit ever. One star not given because we said we have never been here and they didn't offer us any assistance. Got the earmuffs bowl. Yum and the joey bag of donuts burrito   Enjoyed the chips tried the queso side, will go bigger next time. Clean, pleasant folks. Loved the \"welcome to Moe's\" every time someone came thru the door. You'll be saying that again to us soon"}
{"text":"This place looks nice but that's about it. The staff is inattentive and you don't hear welcome to Moes. The food looks like it's been sitting for several days. The chips tasted stale. And to top it off there was HAIR in my food! Vegas Moes sucks ass!! I need to go back to the real Moes in Atlanta."}
{"text":"I feel like moes is chipotles red headed step sister. The taste of the food just isn't as good as its other alternatives. Too much spices added and overall everything tastes kind of burnt. One good thing about this location in particular is how nice the employees and management are. And FREE CHIPS AND SALSA is the best! Overall just kinda eh though."}
{"text":"moe's is the only mexican food i will eat.  they assemble your food right in front of you and make it however you like.  i love how they have several vegetarian choices that taste so nice and fresh.  sometimes it is hit or miss with the staff, but most of the time they are very friendly and quick. the food is so yummy, if i do encounter a sour face, it is totally forgotten by the time i start eating!! :)  the portions are mucho generous and they give you lots of free chips i would pay for anyway!  yummy!  my serious weakness at moe's is the queso.  i love it.  it hates me, but i love it.  mmmm! cheeeeeessseee!  if you are looking for a quick fresh mexican meal, give them a try.  and don't forget the queso!"}
{"text":"Good food. And good quality. The service was fairly fast for mine but took a little longer for my friend because of what she ordered. Food was ."}
{"text":"I went to Moe's for the first time last week - in the middle of the lunch rush.  The service was quick and we scored a table outside.    I got the taco combo with chips and queso.  The tacos were so stuffed, I could hardly eat them!  Great food but a bit messy.   There are tons of food options and rumor has it they have a decent happy hour."}
{"text":"i had a craving for mexican, this was the closest one that was not closed. well, basically,  long story short, this place sucks. extremely similar to Qdoba, except Qdoba is actually decent tasting. the only thing thats kinda tasty here is the free chips and salsa. drink machine was interesting...also interesting to watch other people try to figure out how to use it. from now on i'll just stick to taco bell for late night mexican cravings."}
{"text":"The people there are so friendly and nice. It is good for any weeknight not to crowded and just the right price. Also if you get these wired bins (from when that cater) you get a free meal. The place is always in a laughing good mood, welcome to moes !!!"}
{"text":"Moe's is like the Subway of fast food burrito joints. The food is alright and the value is good but there are so many better options available there is really no reason to eat there. If you need a quick burrito, try Chipotle instead. Their ingredients are much fresher, and the seasonings they use are way better too."}
{"text":"The burritos are just okay. You can get better at Rubios or Chipotle! The nachos are HUGE - the hubby and I split an order and still didn't finish them. A little disappointing though. I found the toppings kind of bland. But hey, where else can you get $2 Heinekens and $1 Bud Lights on a Friday night? Moe's that's where!"}
{"text":"This location has great customer service. Brian was the one helping me and truly represented what a good associate looks like.  Thank you Brian. I will be coming here the next time I'm looking for a burrito!"}
{"text":"This was the first visit to any Charlotte Moe's Southwest Grill. We were promptly greeted with, \"Welcome to Moe's\" and seemed like any other visit to Moe's. How do I know this? Because there's a Moe's across the street from work and I am a weekly patron, sadly to report, but the peeps there know me and take care of me very well. So I'm a fan of (that) Moe's, but now I'm a fan of this Charlotte location because they make your carnitas fresh!! It took some time, but I appreciated the hot off the grill carnitas for my meal."}
{"text":"I came in just after the lunch break. Service was fast and friendly.   I ordered the homewrecker burrito with chicken. The chicken itself was quite tasty. However, the rest of the burrito left something to be desired. It just didn't taste properly fresh... as if the veg and beans and condiments had been sitting out and had gone limp.  Overall, it wasn't bad for fast-food Mexican however I could probably do better going to Chipotle instead."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time while on vacation in the Charlotte area.  The food was fresh and there were a lot of options, even for a vegetarian like myself.  We also enjoyed the queso but, the chips were not the best.  The employees were fantastic.  We had a great experience and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Where to start...not impressed whatsoever.  We originally went in because it was kids eat free on tuesday.  Great marketing for anyone with kids.  The lady that was making our order wasn't friendly at all, seemed like a robot.  When we got to the cashier, she said our total was $31, \"with the free kids meals?\" Yeah she said.  Oh no, I did it again...she charged us for the kids meals. But what she said, she did it again, meaning this is the only day kids eat free, dont keep charging the guests that come I  with kids, order kids meals and charge them.  They refunded it back to our card eventually.  Then my wife's burrito wasn't wrapped up right and was falling all over the place, so I asked for them to re wrap it, they made a whole new one which was nice but forgot to out the cucumbers back in it.  Place was overall dirty and not kept up, the janitor/storage closet was open the whole time we were there, which you walk right by to get your salsa and drinks.  Won't be back unless it's a Tuesday again, so I can get free food for my kids."}
{"text":"Decent food. Sometimes it is really good and other times it lacks any flavor but if you are in a hurry to get food it's an option."}
{"text":"Pricey, even for breakfast. McCarran needs to drop the rents so that food prices can become somewhat sane again. $10 breakfasts are a travesty."}
{"text":"Same Moe's you would expect with a friendlier wait staff. Food is decent, portions are big, moes Monday, and counter staff there to help. This is one of many build your own burrito places. I would argue this is the most American tasting between Qdoba, Chipotle, and salsaritas. $5.55 for a burrito and chips every Monday."}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would. It is always empty no matter what day or time you are there and it's no wonder - the service is by far the worst. The food is not good either. I have been to Moes in other locations throughout the country and this one is terrible. We have been there a total of four times and this is what has happened - 1. Walked in with my husband, there were 11 workers and not one person said anything to us. I finally had to ask, \"is someone going to take our order?\" 2. We were charged for things we did not buy. 3. We were again charged for things we did not buy. My order was wrong. The kids menu says they have apple juice and they don't leaving my three-year-old, who gets juice only as a treat, extremely upset. I asked to speak to a manager and was told there was not one on duty. I asked to be reimbursed for the overcharge and was told they were not able to do it and I had to return when a manager was there. Unbelievable. They stole from me!  After visit 3, I called the store and spoke with The manager, Brianna. I told her what happened, she said to return to the store with my receipt and they would comp the value of the receipt.   Visit 4 - had to wait for the workers to call Brianna. She denied the comp. I even spoke with her on the phone. I gave her the date and the time that we spoke. She said she remembered our conversation but did not remember saying she would comp our meal.   We left. Absolutely disgusted with this place and will never return."}
{"text":"The food was good I had a joey jr , it could of been a little warmer .but it tasted good , the staff was friendly . They might of been short staff because I had to wait a few minutes for someone to fill my joey  . But they apologize for the wait which was nice and the cashier was nice as well. I also thought it was a good deal for a joey , chips and a drink for 6 .50 .Also the free Salas is good . When I go back I will ask them to warm my joey up .lol"}
{"text":"I've visited Moe's many years ago and finally came back. The menu is very simple and just enough choices. I got the homewrecker with tofu, pinto beans, corn salsa, lettuce and the southwest vinaigrette. Pretty disappointed in how little of the filling was placed inside, the burritos aren't as big as they used to be way back when. They used to be really filled like chipotle. The lady asked if I wanted any guacamole or queso. I asked for guacamole and she asked a side or bowl, I'm thinking geez a bowl that's gotta be a big amount (I love guacamole) but I decided to just go with a \"side\". I got home, the chips weren't the greatest some were actually barely cooked and bland. The side of guacamole was ridiculous it was a tiny cup like when you get a dressing on the side of a salad. I paid 10.00 which wouldn't be bad if they stuffed their burritos like they used to and if the side of guacamole was double the amount. I love that they have lots of vegan options which I need because I am lactose intolerant and eating out is easier if there's vegan foods. Their tofu is extremely delicious. I'll be back because their burrito and guacamole are really good, just wish they'd stuff them up better like they used to many years ago."}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday at 2:30p.  They were out of rice, but charged full price for orders that are to include rice. Without rice the volume, texture and flavor of a dish is deflated. They were also out of lime vinaigrette for salads.   The trash cans were so overflowing we put our trays back on the table. This was our first time trying Moe's. We probably won't be back.   Our receipt had a slightly different street number: 8548, but I verified the location by looking at the map pin."}
{"text":"I love the warm welcome \"Welcome to MOESSS\"  I never had bad experience here.. Moes Monday price options are good..  But parking is a bit pain at this location.."}
{"text":"I reallly want to like you Moe's.  I do.  I live so close and you are sooo convenient.  BUT.... I ventured out for a taco salad last week, excited for some mexican delicousness with a side of my favorite condiment, guac.  What I got was a flavorless chicken salad with so so guac on the side.  Even my bf agreed my guac is better and not only am I not a \"cook\", I am also not of Mexican heritage.  I expected much much better.  Dang.  I am still looking for that authentic Mexican taste in a quick take out, and I know it's out there..."}
{"text":"Okay so I am a huge fan of Moe's.  I have been to a few Moe's and this one lives up to the others reputation.  Maybe the only reason I like this one more than the others is due to the fact that this one is newer and not as crowded most of the time.  Most Moe's I go to have tons of kids and families and this one didn't have much of that.  It was quiet, clean, and personal.  I went on a Sunday at dinner time around 1pm and it was perfect pick me up toward the end of the weekend.  I recommend any Moe's but your in the area, and love Moe's you might want to check this one out."}
{"text":"The back of the restaurant stinks like a wet dog. I enjoy the free style coke machine but they were out of my choice, vitamin water.   The Price compared to other similar Mexican places is higher for a equal quality. They do have the best salsa but it stinks, it stinks, it stinks!!!"}
{"text":"Having eaten at Moe's several times before across the east coast, my wife and I were very excited to see a new location opening up in Summerlin. We had very high expectations and sadly those expectations were not met. The portion sizes were smaller than they used to be and the prices were not worth the meal that we received.  Besides the food, the staff for the most part seemed very miserable. Some had very bad attitudes while others had no idea what was going on around them. The restaurant was not very busy at the time, so there is no excuse for being miserable.   The cleanliness of the restaurant left something to be desired. While there was one employee sweeping the floor, there were tables that we dirty and the garbage was overflowing.  Overall the experience was very disappointed. We may attempt dining there again in a few months once they figure out their way."}
{"text":"The food is ok, and overall this place is better than the one on Rainbow, but what the hell has happened to this location now?!? The girls that originally opened this location are gone, along with the great customer service. I feel bad for people who haven't gone to Moe's anywhere else because Vegas isn't representing Moe's well, at all."}
{"text":"Wow they've gone downhill the short amount of time they've been open. The staff are sassy and borderline rude and the last time I was here they didn't have bacon and the manager said it would be 8 hour wait for it. The fcuk. Now this time they're out of their corn salsa for the night. The girl handled my food twice without washing her hands. I had to ask her to!!!! The manager is just sitting in a booth not even helping doing what looks like schoolwork. Seriously so done and I'm writing to corporate because I know this isn't how Moe's should be. They just lost a customer."}
{"text":"Due to a management change, the service is no longer as good as I mentioned in the previous review."}
{"text":"I hit Moe's regularly for their breakfast burritos when catching a flight out of the A gates. As airport fare goes Moe's is decent for sure and isn't priced too outrageously. There burritos are made to order as opposed to sitting under a heat lamp, service is quick and the serve beer and wine if you're there later in the day. Moe's certainly isn't on the level of a Roberto's or Pepe's when it comes to Mexican food, but for airport food they do just fine."}
{"text":"I've been to Moe's at Market Square several times.  I like the place and the food. They include chips and salsa with your order if you are dining in.  I like Moe's much more than Chipotle's, maybe because they have not been in the news for making people sick. Service has always been friendly. I will return."}
{"text":"So I came here when they very first opened. And it was a train wreck. The employees sucked, the manager wasn't managing, and the food came out like a retarded cousin of a burrito. I was truly upset because I used to love going to the Moe's in BloNo. But I figured it was literally their second day open I will come back in a few weeks and give them a second chance.  2nd time around, service was a lot better, and the food quality has improved.   If you don't know what Moe's is, it's basically chipotle. As an admit hater of chipotle i actually prefer the Americanized Moe's. Because let's be real chipotle is not real Mexican food it just pretends to be.   If you like burritos and don't want to shit yourself for a week come here over chipotle. But don't expect beautiful scenery or super cheap prices. Yeah it's probably going to cost you 10-12 dollars for your meal, do you think you can swing that? I like Moe's maybe with time the employees and the service will get better. My advice is come here at an off time or else you might get stuck waiting for a very long time"}
{"text":"Bought $10 chicken burrito bowl and it was tasteless.  Tasted like a terrible salad.  The rice and chicken literally have no taste. Nothing at all like Chipotle.  Nice try making it look like it and even the names are similar, its just terrible food.  Definitely do not eat here."}
{"text":"Had a hard time enjoying my burrito today. The entire restaurant smelled like a dirty bathroom -- as if a toilet had overflowed. Horrible. There were several customers sitting happily outside the bathroom who didn't seem to notice. But it was overwhelming to us. Unfortunately, I won't be back there any time soon."}
{"text":"First time to this location. It was a good experience, staff friendly and curtious, fast with the service. The food was amazing and the portions are huge, but enough to go back home for lunch the next day. Very tasty the second time as well, that's a plus in my book, when you can take the food home and it taste just as good. The chips seem pretty fresh. The salsas are very good, we got tomatillo and one of the mediums. All very good, like the size of the establishment compared to the other one in Great Northern Mall. Will repeat visit."}
{"text":"The food is good and most of the employees are nice but last time I went here I asked for a burrito bowl. I wanted sour cream on the side (and the salsa but I'll explain that in a moment) because I usually don't finish it in one sitting and warming it up with sour cream and salsa is gross.  Anyway, the woman making it got mad, rolled her eyes and reminded me of my teenager when I ask her to do the dishes. So basically I just let her put the salsa on the bowl.   To sum up. Overall they are fine, just hope you don't end up with this employee if you need anything special."}
{"text":"Food was yummy but service was pretty sh**** specifically jaarod. When my wife asked for extra meat he got an attitude and his response was \" you should have told me before\" he made a big deal about a sticker and there wasn't any food in the bowl yet. Portions sucked and the pinto beans weren't cooked. Other then that I enjoyed my bowl!"}
{"text":"the rude manager just lost a steady customer....ive had dozens of homewreckers with guac...and 2 tiny teaspoons is not acceptable. ill just spend my money at chipolte where im respected! wish id have looked at your name mr one of the managers, guac police...insulting a customers intelligence is very bad business!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! I recommend if you go there get the stack with either chicken or steak. It's really good and the queso they have is to die for. Free refills on drinks too."}
{"text":"Alright, I like Moe's. I've been to a number of Moe's in many different locations, they are great for vegetarians and I know what to expect which is nice (the whole point of chain fast food places). This one on the other hand is something else completely.   First Impression: Why are there so many teenagers in here? (Of course right next to NASH so yes, high schoolers everywhere. Looks like a Moe's, feels like a high school cafeteria.   Service:  \"Welcome to Moe's!\", as expected. Now, for the main event, choosing the ingredients on your chosen type of food. The people on the other side of the counter must think that I work there, he asks, \"Rice?\". Now I have been to Moe's before but between all of the other Southwest/Mexican-style fast food places, I don't remember the types of rice. At least give me some options! \"Anything else?\" Why yes young squire, I would also like some pinto beans and throw some queso on there. Next on to the cold stuff. Again, I just start telling mademoiselle what I would like. (At this point 5 people are in the line behind me) She keeps rushing me, as if the people behind me cannot wait. Same deal with my father, who is definitely a little slower than I am, she puts his quesadilla on the grill before he gets to ask for cilantro. Really, what is the rush?! Now to the girl at the cash register, \"Is it just the stack?\" she says with the most neutral face in the whole world. No, also that other thing whatever it is, burrito? (I'm not sure what my father has ordered). \"It's a quesadilla\", in the most condescending tone. Wow okay, can't wait to come back here with your attitude.   Atmosphere: Teenagers, everywhere. Friends of the employees too, shouting across the room, mock complaining, just not a great place. I'm not sure if there was anyone who is actually a manager working there.    Food: Haphazardly put together, same taste as any Moe's but really I would just avoid. No care taken to put it all together, almost like a preschooler's piece of art, you want to like it, but deep down you know it's just a blob on a piece of paper.   Drinks: Just had water. Ask for a water glass, they give you a clear plastic cup. Free.   Price: Normal Moe's prices, which can be found on their website. I'd say you're looking at sub $10 each if you're getting soft drinks. If not, even better, under $7 for the Julia Gulia (Veggie Stack).   Restrooms:  Was just in a rush to leave. Didn't bother.   Overall: Food is, okay. This place, I probably wouldn't even get it to go, just go to a different Moe's, or a whole different establishment all together. Or make some food at home, that always works."}
{"text":"I like these places where you go up to a counter and choose your own ingredients. So at Moe's, I ordered the \"Earmuff\" Burrito Bowl with Rice, Chicken, Cheese, Black Olives, Mushrooms, Sour Cream, Guacamole, and Bacon. But even though I'm a Baconaholic, I confess I'd leave off the Bacon on my next visit--you know, \"less is more.\" Otherwise, this was a great composition for me and I would definitely order it again. Their chips are light and crispy; and their guacamole is fresh and tasty. I'm not into \"spicy\" so I like that the food was mild, but there is a salsa bar for those who want more heat. And they have one of those wonderful beverage machines with the infinite choices of sodas.The servers were friendly and there was plenty of seating, even some outdoors. I will certainly be coming back!"}
{"text":"This location will give you everything that you would expect from a Moe's experience: friendly service, decent TexMex food made in front of you, and some ok chips.   The food is good and cheap, but if you're looking for some pizazz, this won't be it.   However, if you're looking for a cheap chain restaurant meal prepared quickly this will foot the bill.   This location is close to I-77 and located near a stop light. I have never seen it super busy, so it would be an alright place to stop if you're traveling with picky eaters who don't want to experiment with a new place."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome experience! Excellent service from EACH employee and manager...Fresh food! As someone who lived in ATL in the past, I was thrilled to see Moe's in Cleveland!! My deceased friend introduced me to Moe's down South..I went in with celebrating her August birthday in mind. Thanks for a memorable experience with amazing service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"I have never had a truly hot meal from this location of moe's. Tonight was the absolute worst. My meal is ICE COLD. the beans, the meat, the tortilla. I stopped on my way home, which is literally down the street. If I had time I would take it back. I do not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time.  Small portions and a rude staff.  My children only get meat cheese and lettuce on their burrito.  Heaven forbid you ask for extra ground beef, since you aren't getting rice beans salsa etc.  they won't give it to you.   Save your time and go to chipotle!"}
{"text":"This was my first and last visit here.  The food was absolutely disgusting!  It was bland and greasy.  I paid almost 15 bucks for 1 taco, 1 nacho with 1 drink and caso sauce. The soda machine was out of over half of its flavors.  The salsa bar was a mess, it took over a dozen of napkins to clean myself up from all the grease.  Taco bell would have been a better choice!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Moes where I live in northern VA so was happy to see this newer location.  I like the new menu setup, I ordered a burrito bowl which came out tasting great and which I dressed up at the salsa bar.  I love Moes' free chip and the salsa bar is a big favorite of mine.  The price for the meal is very reasonable, considering they are using fresh ingredients and of course the free chips... The space and atmosphere is very nice and accommodating for families.  Service was very friendly, with the signature \"Welcome to Moes\" when I walked in and the place was very clean and orderly so I could tell they are attentive.  I'll be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I like it.  If you like chipolte you will like this.  You also get chips with your meal without having to pay extra.  The queso dip is great! More vegetables, including fresh jalapeño peppers.    Go on Monday for meal deals.  Yippy skippy"}
{"text":"I ordered catering for 15 on Cinco de Mayo, for right before a Pens playoff game no less.  Everyone at the party was blown away about the amount of food, toppings, chips, etc.. we received.  We were also given serving utensils, plastic ware, serving burners... we did expect to get any of that!  Totally worth every penny.  The Manager was super cool and helped me bring the order out to my car.  Sorry I didn't get his name!! Young guy, dark hair haha.  If I cater like that again, I won't hesitate for a second to get Moes.  Just a tremendous experience all around.  Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and the service is always excellent, the cashier even told me about their mobile app and I got free queso out of it. Food quality is great but not excellent, also this place has a great dining room. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"$10 Dollars for a Breakfast Burrito ? Can we say Highway Robbery!!!  I had arrived at the Airport for a flight and I was famished . So I thought I would give Moe's a try .  Where I'm from $!0 gets you a Huge Burrito .   At this Moe's in the Airport you get a Midget Burrito with Sparse fillings that you would pay $2 for at a Taco Bell.  It was Ok but I wont be Back .   Far better options around.     Staff seemed distracted ."}
{"text":"Overall, my disappointment with the place is in walking in there not realizing that what I really wanted that evening was to be waited on in an establishment that also had good food and good value. With that in mind, I tried to account for the subjectivity and pad my rating a half-star but in retrospect I feel that perhaps I'm still being generous. I give Moe's props for their general efficiency--the line did not slow down. Their prices are also reasonable and the staff are generally helpful (the shift manager seemed courteous and when I asked for containers they did so without hesitation). The negatives are: 1) flavors of the items I ordered are okay but nothing special--I could have gone to several other places within a 3-mile radius with more memorable entrees;  2) ratio of chips to item ordered is too high; 3) low salsa to chips ratio--it is not served in group-sized portions but in single serving plastic containers of the kind you normally would use for take-out and leftovers; 4) interior decor is designed to move people out of there and not enjoy their time there (even McDonald's feels more relaxing). To sum up, if you want a cheap, fast lunchtime option with filling food, Moe's is one of many acceptable choices around town. If you want to have a relaxed time eating good food on a weekend evening, skip this place.  Full disclosure: I was there with my wife and son. She was more focused on our experience and did not mind the place too much (at least she did not say anything to me about it). My son was not happy about the fact that the kid's menu did not contain enough items that he liked."}
{"text":"We moved to AZ about a year ago.  Prior to that we lived about 20 minutes from a Moe's.  Now we live about 45 minutes away.  Even with the drive, this Moe's is way better than our old one.  1.  They have daily specials.  Kids eat free on the weekends.  Other meal deals during the week.  Awesome.  2.  We eat tofu.  So, when we get there we have to wait 6 minutes while they cook it.  That kinda sucks...except we just get our chips and queso and eat that while we wait.  Then they always make us a TON of tofu and it's nice and fresh and hot.  3.  They are not stingy with the food.  They give you what you want and they don't skimp.  4.  They are friendly there.  That says a lot.  5.  The store is not dirty.  I mean, it is still 'fast food-ish' so don't expect pristine but we do see them out cleaning it up.  It's in way better shape than the last Moe's where we used to go.  Bottom line:  despite many, many food choices within 10 minutes, we still spend the time and gas money to hoof it on over to Moe's as often as possible."}
{"text":"Not a pleasant experience.  They had only be open for 25 minutes and it seemed the staff was already fed up.  I ordered the stack and it fell apart-had to eat it with a fork and knife/that would have been OK if it tasted good.  The chips were very greasy.  I think we'll have to wait a while before going back."}
{"text":"I only go to Moe's for the $5 Mondays lol. The employees aren't very friendly but the food is good. and try the coke machine! You will stand there for like 10 minutes lol"}
{"text":"I love Moe's, personally I like it better than Chipotle because of the salsa bar at most locations. Since this is an airport location, no salsa bar :( but just ask and they will give you to-go cup size salsa/queso.   Burritos are my personal fav at Moe's it's hard to go wrong. This location has breakfast burritos, which for me is a great option instead of taking the long walk back down the A gate hallway to less healthier BK for a quick lunch while waiting to board my flight."}
{"text":"I've been to Moe's a couple of times and just don't get it. The burritos and salads are \"meh\".  Priced around the same as Chipotle, if not marginally more by a buck or two, I wouldn't really come here again.  Their salads need A LOT of work."}
{"text":"Not welcome to Moe's!  Was upcharged for queso on my birthday burrito, meanwhile the Chipotle across the street is giving out free queso to everyone today."}
{"text":"Great addition to our neighborhood. Our first time to any Moe's.  Tasty offerings.  Loved the self-serve salsa bar.  Saw the nice selection of iced teas too late, but plan to sample them next trip. Not too busy at 2 pm, but a steady stream of customers."}
{"text":"I was at the Cleveland Clinic.  It's never a good thing to be at the Cleveland Clinic, unless you work there....    I had some time to kill before my son's next appointment, and he knew there was a Mexican place that has new ownership.  That will be replacement for Chipotle, right?  Why not?  When we got there, I was laughing that the menu featured the Art Vandalay!  As a big Seinfeld fan, I was loving that inside joke!  George Costanza wishes he was immortalized that way!  I was already thinking \"screw it - we're at the Clinic\" mixed with \"I really like the chicken nachos at the Lizard...\", so I got the nachos.  SO GOOD.  I got to pick extra veggies that I wanted on there, the chicken was plentiful, and they were really good!  Not the usual bland, overpriced fare that you put up with and get because you're at the hospital.  My son really liked his burrito and it looked huge.  That is good.  The salsas were good, clean and labeled.  We're not always that lucky!  I wasn't hungry again until later that night, and just had some cereal and fruit because I really felt like I went out for lunch.  It was that good.  I would definitely go there again...if I have to."}
{"text":"Trying to find a cheap place for dinner in downtown Pittsburgh is near impossible.  So many places are closed by 4:00.  I know Moe's is a national chain, but we don't seem to have too many in Pittsburgh?  This might be the only one?  Who knows.  I ordered the Julia Guilia stack ($7.22 w tax), which was essentially a vegetarian burrito panini with a hard taco inside.  The vegetarian version comes with free queso and free guacamole which is cool by me.  The wrap isn't overly flavorful, but being as it comes with chips and salsa, it is super cheap.  Speaking of salsa, the salsa bar has some nice options, and you can actually see tomatoes in the red salsa.  Move aside Chipotle and Qdoba, I think Moe's is way better.  The food is cheaper, there are more options, and it tastes better.  One issue: Why do they feel the need to do the \"Welcome to Moe's!\" thing?  The last thing I need is to be screamed at by strangers when I enter an establishment."}
{"text":"After eating breakfast at Flatbreadz, my husband told me that it was our breakfast and lunch.  Since I get nauseous when I'm hungry, I had to buy something else to eat.  My husband and I walked to Moe's and I ordered the vegetarian nachos (without beans).  The ingredients were fresh and the chips were light and delicate.  I'll definitely come back here to eat if I'm at this airport again.  Next time, I may want to order a burrito."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to this location but they are unbelievably stingy on meat and toppings and slow to fill orders. So disappointing."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to a Moe's Southwest Grill.  My first visit was the location outside of the Jobing.com arena in Glendale a few weeks back before a concert.  When you walk in, the employees behind the counter all yell \"Welcome to Moe's!\".    I only had a short amount of time for lunch today (about 20 minutes) so I was hoping for a quick turnaround on my order.    I ordered the \"Joey Bag of Donuts\" , Moe's name for their burrito with rice, beans, chicken, shredded cheese, and salsa.  My burrito was made to order fairly quickly.  The \"Joey\" was good - it reminded me a lot of Chipotle's large burritos.  Between the two I'd still probably choose Chipotle.  Fortunately guacamole was included as a side with the combo because the tortilla chips were kinda bland.  I'd recommend Moe's If you're looking for a quick, fresh meal.  Just make sure you have enough time to eat yours.  I ended up being about 8 minutes late!"}
{"text":"Happened to eat at Moes because it was walking distance from my hotel. Food was bad. Had the Burrito Bowl with beef.   Beef- chewy and bland.  Rice - taste like instant rice but worse  Salsa- Yuk. I tried 3 different salsas and didn't care for any of them.    I live in Houston and am comparing this food to good Mexican food which is readily available where I live."}
{"text":"We enjoyed there new soda machine, it's neat!  The made to order food is fresh and we thought it was great!!  But the music was way too loud for us."}
{"text":"The food might of been okay other than I was given my friends food and vice versa!!!  We did not order the same food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The girl made our sandwich with Eric interrupting and being rude the whole time!  Who could work in that situation?  Eric ran his mouth from the time we walked in the restaurant until we left!  He flirted with the girl working and carried on an inappropriate conversation with the lady after us!  I think someone working should talk but within business like conversation!!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't believe their claim that they'll serve breakfast until 10. 15 minutes before they'll shut down and start serving lunch so if you like breakfast make sure you get here early. I'll never eat here. Zero customer service. And now a bad review to boot."}
{"text":"If I could leave no stars I would. For starters they close their doors 30 minutes early every single night and look at you while they're sweeping the floors and putting food away. They're always low on their salsa and the food prep is always a mess. This location is garbage I wouldn't recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  They have a nice kids eat free on Thursdays.  I don't love all the TVs around though.  All said, solid Mexican place."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday around 5:30...good thing, as by the time we left, the line was out of the restaurant (approx. 30 people).  Very similar to a Chipotle, although there are some differences on the menu (that I prefer, actually).  Ingredients were pretty fresh, although I would've liked a little bit more meat (pork) in my burrito.  I had the home wrecker, and it was pretty good.  Appreciated the choice of five salsas to enjoy with my chips, and their hot sauce for the burrito was killer.  Wife and kids seemed pleased with their choices, too.  I imagine we'll be back."}
{"text":"Good fast Mexican food. The lunch portions are the right size. It is not too much food.  Didn't care for the yelling out Welcome to Moe's every time the door opened. They have a nice patio area over looking Market Square."}
{"text":"I love Moe's! This location does get VERY busy durning lunch time. The employees are super nice and do try to get you through the line as quickly as possible."}
{"text":"Well moes, what can i say. My friend and i start to go there during my freshman year and keep going. Why? Because they have really good nachos and burritos. The portions are big and sometimes i just get a moes mood and just head there for some good nachos."}
{"text":"It's like a salty version of chipotle if that is even possible.   I'm not sure what was so salty in it but it was basically unedible.  My husband got something that was just like taco bells crunch wrap.   I'll never go back.  The soda machine was the best part"}
{"text":"Chili Queso was very good. Free chip and dip when you order. Salsa is good.  I would not recommend the steak bowl, the steak was so full of fat it was literally inedible. My steak bowl ended up being a bowl of beans and rice. It was a tasty bowl of beans and rice but an expensive one. Fountain drinks are a little pricey here."}
{"text":"I love that they have tofu tacos and a salsa bar on the side. What I don't like is that its pretty expensive for fast food. I know I spend way more here in comparison to Chipotle next door. I mean, if you're looking for a tasty burrito, this isn't the place. But, for some tofu tacos, I'll come here."}
{"text":"It's probably not Moe's fault that the parking at this location is terrible. But, it does detract from the overall experience when you can't find a parking spot in the super narrow, one-way circular lot that surrounds it and Brixx (next door). The side spaces that used to be available were eaten up by the chicken place on the other side of the establishment. If you don't luck out in finding a spot, you'd have to park at the chicken place or farther to walk over for quasi decent southwestern fare.  The first few times I ate at Moe's, things were very fresh, clean, and mostly efficient. As it's been around for a little while now, the service has gone downhill, along with some of the cleanliness and freshness.   My most recent experience: I lucked out and found a spot during a busy lunch hour on a sunny day and was served right away. The most cheerful person in the serving line was the woman who got out the bowl and served the rice and beans before I got to the other two folks in the line. The middle person was harried and uninterested, and the cashier was rushed and came off with an attitude of, \"I would rather be anywhere but here.\" I get that jobs aren't always fun but it sucks to take it out on the patrons. There wasn't anyone right behind me so I'm not sure what all the rushing was about.   The bowl I got had some lackluster ingredients. The guacamole was turning and looked at least a day old, if not older. If I have to pay extra for something, I expect it to be good.  The biggest pros about Moe's are the big bag of chips they give you, the warm queso is very tasty, and the soda fountain. But it's little comfort when you've spent $10-12 on a meal and you  aren't eating the freshest food you've ever seen, after dealing with rude or indifferent staff. I don't need forty, \"Welcome to Moe's!\" but unhurried service with a smile would be nice -- oh and fresh guacamole."}
{"text":"The service was good but the food is terrible!! Nothing that they serve even resembles Tex-Mex. Their queso is watery and gross. Throwing beans and chips together does not make Mexican food."}
{"text":"Sub-par, poor imitation of Chipotle. The food lacks flavor and the rice is TERRIBLE. Taco Bell has better rice. Half of my peppers were cooked and the other half were raw...not sure if this is a Moe's thing or not. The free chips and salsa was nice, but the salsa looked like it had been sitting out for a few days.  As a bonus, the employees will stare at you while you eat."}
{"text":"In the battle of the BIG BURRITO, Moe's wins out!  In my opinion Moe's burritos have way more flavor than Chipotle. There are way more toppings to choose from and the kicker is FREE chips and salsa!  The only draw backs are they are a bit slow behind the counter. Where Chipotle has 10+ people working any given shift, Moe's only has 3 or 4. Sometimes it gets backed up. Also the consistency of the size of the burrito is not there. Depending on who makes your burrito you can get a skinny one or an over stuffed one. All things considered I find Moe's to be a better experience than Chipotle."}
{"text":"So my last review got deleted because the location is closed. My Yelp app will not allow me to choose a new city. Maybe it needs an update Im not sure. So I head to Pittsburgh alot. Anyway I finally brought my laptop home from work and was able to get some places done I had been. Sorry Yelp does not specify a date, project a date, or even require one. Yes I was at a Tom Petty concert if that gives you an idea. That does not change the details. I have my Moes App to prove my dates for rude judgmental owners who apparently go out of their way to only garnish the positive. Clearing showing the interest to get better. I was going to the state college Moes for much better service and quality. Obviously that owner has no worries. So do what you have to do. I personally give my real life experience and you solidify why it is now closed. Touche!"}
{"text":"Moe's is mine and my Daughter's favorite place to eat.  The food is safe, the queso dip is awesome, the chips usually fresh.  They have one of the touchscreen Coke machines that makes raspberry Coke Zero.  For fast food, it doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"For someone who has NEVER written a bad review on any restaurant ever, I felt this was needed because I am someone who loves Moe's, but has an awful experience.   First: there weren't enough large sized burrito wraps, so on $5 Moe's Monday, I could only get a junior.   Second: there were 5 people in line, and one girl was running the food line, while the 2 employees were standing with wash rags behind the register making jokes, and not helping the girl trying to make all the meals by herself.   Third: when I got to the register, I had to request for a drink, and when given my cup, the girl at the register literally laid the cup on my tray; yes, on its side.  Fourth: the ice machine is down with no sign.   Fifth: As I'm looking around, I see 3 of the 4 tables around me vacant and uncleaned.   Sixth: I got way short changed on my portion amounts.  Like I said, I'm not a complainer by any means but holy cow, Unless if a spider came out of the ceiling and landed on my head while eating here, it couldn't had been worse."}
{"text":"First of all, service has become painfully slow. Previously, employees worked fast, but this has not been the case, over the last several visits. It will take about a half hour to get through the line, even if there is only four or five people in front of you.  Worse, however, is the overall filthiness of the cooking line. If you decide to go in, take a peek behind the line. Look at the filthiness of the kitchen equipment. Look at the amount of garbage on the floor. Look how nothing appears wiped. Everything has a greasy film over it. Also, look in the dining area. Lots of garbage under the tables. None of the tables are wiped.  I almost did not finish my meal, because I was sickened by the smell. It smelled like dirty mop water, or spoiling produce, or something.  I think this has been going on for at least a few months. Probably new management, but I conjecture.  To be honest with you, I would really stay away from this restaurant until they get their act together. Slowness is forgivable, in a restaurant. But, dirtiness in unacceptable."}
{"text":"Wanna be Chipotle with rude servers behind the counter. Food sucks, staff sucks. Coulda had our business but the rude attitudes pushed us away. Never again. If I was the airport I'd fire em and replace em with a McDonald's. How dare a service oriented business treat customers so poorly. It's a wonder they ever lasted this long with only 2 stars.  It's a black stain on the airports reputation.  So sad!!! 12/18 @ 4:41. If ur the owner I'd fire everyone on duty. Every employee started arguing with the customer. Just sad!!!"}
{"text":"I found Moe's to be average. I ordered a chicken burrito bowl and it was pretty bland.. nothing too special.   The free chips and salsa bar are a plus as well as the outdoor seating. They also are very efficient, especially with a crazy lunch rush.  The main reason for my average review is because of the queso. It basically had no vegetable in it.. it was just white. I'm used to (& addicted) to Q'doba's. They are not even similar.   I may head back to try a regular burrito or something different."}
{"text":"Got seduced by the Monday deal of a burrito, chips, salsa and drink.  First off the pluses, they did a nice job of keeping the line moving and getting orders done.  The place is attractive and clean, plus a couple of TVs in the dining area are a good idea.  Portion size was good.  I had the Burrito with Tofu and Guacamole; pretty much had all of the vegies, the pico and the corn salsa.  My issue was that while all of the ingredients seemed to be of good quality and decently prepared, they really lacked much in the way of flavor.  I have had the build your own burrito at a number of places and I would say that this was the least flavorful I have experienced.  Even the chips and salsa bar was lacking in any thing that would tingle my taste buds.  Overall a disappointment, I would really have been upset if I had paid full price."}
{"text":"Bought the Groupon, so it gets one star for being cheap. Wish the food resembled what was on their pictures. Nothing worth eating again in my opinion. There are so many other places like this in town, I don't know why I would ever go back to a place that didn't taste very good and didn't stock anything with Whole grains even though it's on their menu."}
{"text":"This was our last visit to this Moes. A switch to Chipotle is in order.   The pork was completely dried out so as to be inedible. The chips were brought up from the back and were served cold. The rest of the hot ingredients were cold and sub-par quality. This is not the first time we've had poor service and bad food. Have some pride or lose some customers."}
{"text":"It's basic scoop and serve Fast casual Mexican food. Taco, burrito, quesadilla, and bowls. The same type of stuff you have seen from other chains. Their food is alright, not as bad as some write on here. I do like their hot sauce a lot, had some good kick to it.  Not a lot of choices in gate A, if you want a basic meal then this is fine."}
{"text":"I have always liked Moes but the pricing is ridiculous.  They charge extra for everything.  I ordered a side of queso and it was the smallest container I have ever seen.  Shouting \"Welcome to Moes\" seems like a routine job to the employees as something they have to do- not genuine at all.  One lady that assembles the food always looks miserable and acts as if you are bothering her when picking your toppings.  Manager always has a smile and is quite nice but staff. portions and pricing will reconsider another visit for me."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I LOVE moe's. This is just a horrible location. They are so ridiculously slow and make you feel like you are inconveniencing them. For example, I asked for chicken and the girl lazily says \"we would have to make some...\" with this tone that said \"no, you can't have chicken\"... there are zero customers in here and you are telling me that you haven't made a chance to make some chicken. I just left without getting anything because of the girls attitude"}
{"text":"More mediocre food at McCarran airport. Moe's is located at the end of terminal A. I didn't think it was as bad as other reviewers. I got the junior sized burrito, which was plenty of food for me. The chicken was seasoned well, but was dry. It was filled with mediocre rice and beans and all the typical add-ons that you would find at a fast food place similar to Chipotle. The burrito also came with a pile of stale chips.  Service was slow because there was only one person working. So, she had to assemble the food and ring it up. It was pricey, of course, because you're trapped in the airport and don't have many options."}
{"text":"This Moe's is ok, but not great.  It used to be great.. talking 3-4 years ago.  They've had a lot of staff turnover and most of the employees that have been present my last several trips don't seem to care much about quality service.  I do enjoy the food here a lot and the presence of the computerized Coke dispenser is cool.  They do an okay job of keeping the tables and trash cans clean, but there have been some occasions where there is little foot traffic and the trash cans are still overflowing.    I prefer this to the new Chipotle that recently opened across the road."}
{"text":"When i travel to Caltexico, I go by way of Moe's.  Because although Chipotle and Qdoba do a fine fast food burrito, they don't do it as well as Moe's.    And it is fast food, but it pains me to categorize it in that fashion, because when I say fast food, you're thinking Taco Bell. . . and it's not THAT.  It's a step up.  The comparison is perhaps equivalent to a Red Robin to Wendy's sort of thing.  Red Robin is to Wendy's what Moe's is to Taco Bell.    It's fast (though if you go at noon for a lunch hour meal, you'll question ANY categorization of their food involving the adjective \"fast\"), but good.  I go with the Joey Bag o' Donuts burrito combo with steak and black beans.  Yum.  I'm full now."}
{"text":"This Moe's is about as good as they get and I've seen some tore up Moe's here n there. They are pretty much fast food so I never go in with a high standard set. Just wish they would let the welcome to Moe's chant die!"}
{"text":"If you appreciate really good tacos & burritos you'll fall in love with this place. The food is quite good, the service is good to very good. The value to price ratio is great. The food is fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"This place has a great location next to the movie theater and thats about the only good thing to write.  Staff tonight was rude and throwing food.  Loud and obnoxious, laughing and fooling around.  Smashed the salad bowl on the chips.  Nearly threw food in the floor.  Banging equipment loudly.  Ok, I'm not uptight and I realize they're kids but this was ridiculous.  Really poor training.  Not coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Great Moe's location. Usually go with a burrito bowl. Like the free chips and salsa. I am more of a fan of Chipotle and Qdoba, but this is one of the better Moe's."}
{"text":"Very nice staff.  Place is pretty clean.  I know they have to say \"Welcome to Moes\" but during busy time this can be a headache since several people scream it over and over and over. But that is the corporation rule."}
{"text":"\"WELCOME TO MOE'S!!!!\" This is what you'll hear when you walk in the door at this or any other Moe's Southwest Grill location.  It is the perfect place to go for a chill fast casual meal... It's by far the best fast casual mexican concept around - extremely fresh, clean, friendly, and cheap!  Their chips and salsa are tasty and you don't get so many that you feel sick afterwards.  Also, their salsa selection (3 different kinds) is great whether you are lookiing for spicy or mild... Moe's started in Atlanta so I was familiar with it from when I lived there... I am so excited that they are expanding in AZ!  Moe's is great for families, athletes, health-conscious, or not so health-conscious.  There is something for everyone at Moe's!"}
{"text":"I've been in the area since April and i didn't try this place because the reviews. One of my workers had it the other day and it smelled extremely good so i gave in and went and tried it for myself. And I'm stuck trying to figure out why this place has such a low rating. Because it is extremely good. I like it over chipotle and hot heads. The flavored rice changes the entire experience when it comes to this type of meal. People skip the ratings on this one and try this place. It most definitely gets the #CPerryApproval"}
{"text":"it's moe's food - so not warranting a 5 star just because of that.... however I find it important to note the friendly and convenient atmosphere of this particular moe's location.  the online ordering function in particular is REALLY convenient... avoid lines and have your food waiting on you and already prepaid.... literally takes less than a minute to walk up past people waiting and have them hand you your lunch with a smile."}
{"text":"Went in to eat there for the first time.  The guy working there kept calling me boss, which was annoying.  The meat didn't look fresh at all and was cold.  I wanted ground beef, but there was only a little bit left and it looked very old.    The food line area looked very messy.  When I picked up the tacos, they both fell apart instantly and I had to eat them with a fork.   The food simply wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Pros: Free refills on pop Salsa bar with a variety of options Fresh made chips Friendly staff (welcome to Moe's!)  Cons: Guac was too tomatoey Dining room was cold because of the location of doors Constantly hearing \"welcome to Moe's\" Odd names for all of their items  In general, I'm a fan of Moe's, but usually only when I have a coupon as the cost can really add up when you add on the drink, chips, etc.  I like that everything is made fresh and too your liking.  I was disappointed with the flavor of the chicken and found my rice to be fairly dry.  On a second visit, I had tofu as my protein and I thought it was a much better option than the chicken was.  My major complaint is that they try to be cute with the names of their food items so half the time, I forget whay my burrito bowl is actually called by the time I get up to order it."}
{"text":"Food has no taste. Save your money and go to Chipotle. I wouldn't waste my money on another burrito. They always welcome me but get mad if I only get queso. Especially a certain women. Queso is great! Thanks Moes keep up the mediocre food!"}
{"text":"I came in today at noon (Monday, 8/7/17) at the mad lunch rush hour: twelve bells.  The associates I dealt with were friendly and efficient. I walked in at 12:08 and walked out, with food, at 12:20 which I thought was good since the line was out the door.  The food was standard Moe's fare; I had a bowl with ground beef, seasoned rice, and pinto beans. I could have easily made two meals out of it.  Four stars instead of five due to being very stingy on the chips.  I'd like to pop in at \"not rush hour\" but I was impressed by the performance at Moe's on Forbes today."}
{"text":"The line is always long without reason. There are employees standing around who can start orders of those in line who know what they want while another employee can take time to explain the menu to the new customers. The chips are inconsistent (and free) - sometimes they are soggy and greasy, sometimes they are great, and sometimes they're entirely too salty.  They have changed their menu to only include dark meat Adobo chicken. They should tell their customers that it has recently changed before ordering because I got home and thought that it was spoiled. It was burnt and slimy. I returned to the store only to be told that it had changed. They suggested I try some of their other many proteins but I only liked the chicken.  I ended up just getting a veggie bowl and grilling some chicken breast at home, but I will not do that every time, thus, I will not be returning. What a shame because I was a once per week customer. You had something good and destroyed it. Looks like I'll be going back to Chipotle.  The salsa bar is pretty nice when they keep it clean and the employees are usually very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"I hate to recognize Moe's chief competition in a review but I feel like people are confused about why Moe's is different.  Think of Chipotle as McDonald's and Moe's is more Five Guys.  They both make hamburgers that are good but for different reasons.  If you're a huge fan of Chipotle you'll have to open your mind to a place that truly does use fresh ingredients.  Their choice of toppings is much greater than Chipotle and that is a critical difference.  Moe's gives you control over what your food will taste like.  If you skip over the toppings and spices when you order you can expect a plain tasting meal.  On the other hand, if you load up on hot sauces, pickled and fresh jalapenos you can expect something more lively.  Plus the chips and salsa are free with your meal.  If you enjoy extra spicy food, be sure to ask for the Hard Rock Sauce because it's kept behind the counter."}
{"text":"First time to visit and I loved it! It's nice that the menu doesn't cost an arm and a leg and you even get chips and salsa with your meal. It probably helped that I went on taco Tuesday! I also noticed there is a $2 off coupon on the receipt after completing a brief survey. I will be back and you should try it too! :)"}
{"text":"I'm a Moe's fan, I'll admit. I don't think the flavor is that good(I think all of these types of restaurants taste like a Mexican Subway, and by that I mean any form of imagery you can imagine). But Moe's wins out among the Big 3(Moe's, Qdoba, and Chipotle) in a pinch for a single reason: Moe's offers free chips, which means for less than $3 I can get chips, salsa, and a Unanimous Decision(veggie taco with guac and sour cream). Seriously, how can you beat that?  Honestly, it's just a chain fast food burrito place. You know what you're getting when you walk through the door."}
{"text":"I've ate at this location 1 time before and the service isn't the issue. The people are nice and surprisingly how new this location is, I was shocked to walk in on a 90% sanitation grade. I chose to swing by Moe's for a healthier alternative for a quick and healthy meal but, a 90% is unexceptionable."}
{"text":"Do not, I repeat DO NOT come to this location on a Tuesday!  Apparently, kids eat free and every parent in a 20 miles radius has no intention of cooking!!  Therefore, the line is ridiculously loooong and the restaurant is filled with unruly adolescents accompanied by parents pretending to be oblivious to their poor behavior!!  As for the service, it was decent and not quite as slow as I expected, considering the line was wrapped back through the dining room tables, and there was only 2 girls diligently working the prep line!  The line moved slowly  due to parents who allowed their small kids to order their own food while they climbed up on the counter to point and fill their items with every free ingredient available on the line!  The cashier appeared somewhat frustrated as I observed her handle money and then leave the register to handle a customer's food... a huge no-no for me!!  On a better note, my burrito was prepared as I requested with extra rice and extra queso.  The ingredients were fresh and the chicken was well seasoned.  My burrito is always so huge that I can never eat it all in one sitting!  All in all, a fairly decent and typical Moe's carry-out experience... minus the 50 million children, of course!!"}
{"text":"This is a great Moes, and it's not too far from my house. Their burritos are gigantic, and I usually wrap my burrito butt back up and bring it home with me. It's nice to have leftovers for lunch the next day.  The salsa bar is awesome, and it's one of the big bonuses for me when I'm choosing between Qdoba or Moe's, which are both near my house. Their selection isn't as fabulous as Phat Burrito, but it's cheap, close, and delicious, so I can forgive them for some kind of funky hot sause."}
{"text":"I love this particular location because the staff is always nice, even during the mad lunch rush. The quality of the food is consistent and the simple layout makes it easy for me to place my order, customize my meal, and be on my way. Since the Moe's app has come along, I'm in and out even quicker. I just order and dash in at the time I specified I want to pick up my food. How cool! As long as I get the customary \"Welcome to Moe's\" greeting, I'm good!"}
{"text":"I got the Joey bag of donuts burrito with chicken.  It was OK.  Smaller in size compared to Chipotle, and the favor just did not do it for me.  The free chips that come with the meal were GOOD!!!  Chipotle still captures my heart."}
{"text":"The employees are nice and it's not too expensive this was my first time trying it and I got a burrito bowl with steak. It was ok it's not as good as Chipotle."}
{"text":"First time ever today.... very friendly staff...food was good and lots of it for the price... didn't care much for the salsas... I actually like this place better than chipotle."}
{"text":"GREAT Service ,! Everything is fresh and you get nice size meals. Prices are not bad either. My friends & I were full when it was time to go. But I'll be BACK ."}
{"text":"I could eat here every single day. The queso here is amazing. The workers are so nice there and I love how I get free chips with every single meal. The wrong Doug is by far the best thing on the menu. I high suggest you go to moes and order some food. Definitely way better than chipotle."}
{"text":"I love burritos, hence I love Moe's. I love their veggie burrito. I love that they come with chips. I love the salsa bar. And I love that they're close to the office.  I love Moe Mondays. $5 for a burrito, chips, and drink. Yes, please."}
{"text":"The food was ok -  The manager/owner was in for a few minutes and his interactions with his staff were excellent!   The pop machine was down and zero refund on drinks -"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to having a Moe's close to us. The Cranberry location is great, this one not so much. First time tonight and it was a disappointment, food was prepared in a hurry and it looked that way. It wasn't busy when we entered. Told a staff member it wasn't very good she said sorry and that was it. Not even a why not? Can I get you the manager? So I think we'll pass on Moe's."}
{"text":"Like any other Mexican fast-food restaurant such as Qdoba's or Chipotle. Self-serve salsa for your chips is different. You walk in and hear very enthusiastic welcoming voices shout \"Welcome to Moe's!\" A good-sized menu and outdoor seating with bouncy chairs. A good fun and casual place if you're craving Mexican food alone or with friends!"}
{"text":"I am not sure if it was an off night or what.    Staff just didn't care.  The soda machine was dry, I overheard countless customers inform the cashier.  Without a line in sight, he went to the back and then came right back to register after a few moments.  The were also out of sweet and non sweet tea. So unless you wanted regular coke, you were drinking water.  Food was gross and overpriced.  And it also gave my son food poisoning.  Before we could even walk out to the car (he's only 5) he was projectile vomiting.  I attempted to leave feedback on website but found it impossible to do so."}
{"text":"I asked a couple of dimple questions  about  the food an Asian girl was very short with me \"alienated me\" the rest of the staff was pleasant.....if I owned Moes I would terminate her"}
{"text":"Go to chilis instead. I feel this restaurant is below average for fast food, at best."}
{"text":"YUM I LUV PLASTIC IN MY FOOD.  Yep - had lunch here last friday.  Got take-out while working from home.  Only to get my pretty quesadilla home and get a mouthful of plastic.  Seriously guys.  What on earth.  Other than my dietary restriction on plastic, this would be your typical Moe's.  Friendly quick staff and hopping dining room.  Hope you guys get it together."}
{"text":"First time going & love it!!!! Great staff exposing the menu. Fun atmosphere. Checked on us. We will be back!  Food was superb!  Thank you for a great experience Moes"}
{"text":"Upon walking in we were greeted promptly with welcome to moes the food was prompt it was good price was fine place was clean wonderful service"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Moe's. They aren't the easiest Tex-Mex fast food joints to find, so I'm always excited when I spot one.   We spent $20 on two burritos & a cup of queso. We also brought home two big bags of chips, enough chips to easily feed 4 people.   I'd return again. Good location, but the parking and driving are hairy in this shopping plaza and downright dangerous sometimes."}
{"text":"Very delicious!! I too was asked if I wanted a side of Queso, and was not given any.  The salsa bar is pretty great too!!"}
{"text":"If you need a change from Chipotle, then here's your place. Good tacos plus they always have coupons out or around town. There's never a really long line, plus the staff has always been friendly whenever I go in."}
{"text":"Food always tastes great! No complaints there. However, I do have some complaints about the staff, which is why I gave three stars.   First of all, there have been times I've had my burrito wrapped half-assed. One time it was completely open. Now, I don't know if their heavy turnover is because they hire complete dumb-asses who cant even manage to wrap a friggin burrito, or because they have bad management.   Either way, two things come to mind that have pissed me off in the past.   One; PORTIONS!! I mean seriously, don't be stingy! Give me a decent amount of chips and portions on my food! Especially with rice on the food and chips on the side. Don't give me half a scoop of chips and assume it's enough because that is like 5 chips! I can't stand people who are stingy at these takeout places! I'm paying good money, give me some real portions!   Two; TRAIN YOUR PEOPLE TO DO THE JOB CORRECTLY! There was nothing that pissed me off more than coming home to an open burrito that spilled all over the bag and my seat! My grandmother can make a burrito better than that and she's 87! Take some pride in your job and do it right!   Other than that, no complaints. Good food and well priced."}
{"text":"Today is a sad day for Moe's on East Blvd. If you frequent this location, then I'm sure you've noticed the steady decline in service here. It's gone from mediocre, to downright disrespectful. I won't go on too much of a rant. I'll simply state a few suggestions for their \"training dept/HR department\"(if there is one). 1-don't answer your cell phone in front of any customer 2-don't have piles of dirty dishes beside my burrito bowl, that you're currently preparing 3-don't scream \"not my job\", multiple times. I'm sure everyone heard the 3 workers, across the street at Babalu. 4-do promote or commend the guy who came from the back of the restaurant, to assist me. 5-don't say \"you're done\", in a very obvious dismissive tone, after the completion of my transaction. Maybe a phrase like \"have a nice day\", \"can I get you anything else\". PS: the entire staff were surely over 35. Which isn't old. But, old enough to conduct yourself as someone with common courtesy."}
{"text":"Not improving unfortunately.    Their corn chips are previously frozen, and not so good.  No matter how short the line is, its going to be a long wait.   Food is average at best."}
{"text":"WELCOME TO MOE'S!! Love this place! Super close to where I work, and the $5 specials on Mondays on ALL burritos (yes, even the Homewrecker) are enough to keep me going back each week. I still need to figure out how they fold those darned things when they're THAT BIG so I can do this at home without a mess! :) They fill the burritos up with as much \"stuff\" as you want, enough for two full meals for me. And they have chips and a salsa bar. Their fresh guac is FANTASTIC and you really can't beat their service there! Always welcoming, always helpful, and superfast-this is the perfect place to grab a quick bite for a heck of a deal!"}
{"text":"I love Moe's. Been to this location numerous times as well as a few other locations in the area. They have so many options, and the free chips and salsa is such a great addition to the meal. I always get a little side of queso with my chips and a glass of vanilla at peach tree soda.  I would caution against ordering the carnitas on anything, mine were so fatty I had to pick it out of the burrito. I had ordered it to go so by the time I started eating it I wasn't even in a position to take it back and ask for something else. Other than that I've never had a bad experience here, the staff is friendly and I will return."}
{"text":"I mean...Qdoba, Chipotle...Moe's. Same idea, so it comes down to the little stuff.  Moe's gives free chips with 'entree' sized menu item.  Definite plus.  However, there's no real soup options.  As a proponent of both tortilla soup and the Mexican gumbo, I was a bit disappointed.  Tacos were good enough.  I'd go again."}
{"text":"First off I love Moe's eat at them as often as I can. But this one missed the mark big time. The customer service was good quick in and out making my order.   I got the Joey with steak normal I get chicken. After I ate it I wish I wouldn't have got the steak. It had lots of fat and gristle in it so i had to spit out some pieces I couldn't even chew. The chips for some reason half tasted stale and then I had some that were wet no idea how that even works. But as I was eating it I noticed something taste off and I looked down and I had lots of lettuce and other veggies that were brown and I mean dark rotten brown. I didn't even finish my burrito it was horrid. I would of drove back and showed them but I live nowhere near that location and when I called I didn't get an answer. On a positive the Tomatillo sauce is still good but the burrito had me spewing my guts out for the next few days.   I won't be eating at this Moe's anymore."}
{"text":"Staff is always so friendly!! The food is always fresh and delicious. I love how they don't short you on the chips that you get. The queso is great! We love coming here for a quick lunch or dinner. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I hate to be harsh with Moes because I honestly like eating here, but it's just a quick fix when I want Mexican.  Absolutely nothing jumps out at you when you eat at this place.  The food is a bit too expensive for what you get and what you get is nothing special.  It's not necessarily bland but is certainly cheap.  They have a decent variety and good amount of options but none of what I eat here ranks as the best I can get anywhere.  Also, I'm very annoyed by how they organize and name their menu items.  They try to be cute, but it's really just obnoxious and not helpful.  I mean, you tell me, what do you think of when you hear the term \"Joey bag of donuts\"?  Do you think Burrito?  If it was a Burrito would you have any idea what was on it?  Dumb, right?  The people are nice enough, no real complaints.  But they aren't customer service oriented.  When I was at this particular location, one man worked hard to do a lot of things for me while two other people basically puttered around.  I was kind of annoyed by this.  They're fastidious to yell \"WELCOME TO MOES\" and other random unintelligible things at the right times, but getting me through the line and to my seat without annoying me. . . not so much.  This is kind of a theme for them, they sacrifice being a restaurant for being an experience.  The place is clean, but is often a bit cluttered and disorganized.    One other complaint. . . they have TV's but they are always tuned to ESPN no matter what ridiculous thing is on.  There could be a local game on another channel and they'll leave a screen saver on if that was what ESPN was showing.  Dumb.  One compliment. . . they have decent homemade tortilla chips and a salsa bar.  Both are bottomless.  Really cool.  Also, they have one of those new Coke Machines that gives you over 100 options in pop.  All in all, it's like going to Subway.  Sometimes you crave it, sometimes it's just convenient, and sometimes you avoid it like the plague.  If you know what to expect, it delivers exactly that and you won't be disappointed, but if you expect to be blown away. . . find another restaurant."}

{"text":"Awesome service and food!  Clean restaurant, stocked well and clean tables.  This Moe's puts the Sun Valley location to shame."}
{"text":"We have visited this location in Indian Trail on several occasions hoping the experience would be better, but tonight was no different.  At 6:30pm, only 2 other families in the restaurant and every table was dirty, trash cans were overflowing, food was lukewarm, and only 3 employees working.  Sweet tea had unsweetened tea in the container.  We notified an employee, however when we returned for a refill, nothing had been corrected.  This restaurant is in a prime location to do exceedingly well, but not with how it is managed.  It's unfortunate because Moe's has some great locations around Charlotte. This one has much to improve upon."}
{"text":"I am being generous with a three star review for this location.   I came here to grab a quick bite to go. I enter the vicinity and there were couple of folks in line. I was greeted after three mins of me being in line. I got their Monday's special, the guy who took my order was very friendly. I made-sure that guac was free with veg burrito and he said YES!   I come to check out counter and the guy was acting like he didn't wanted to be there. No smile, pretty down guy, infact he didn't even made eye contact. He just took the card out of my hand and ran it through. Another employee got the order on the counter with a glass. I didn't even get a thank you or a smile.   Anyways, I went to get the soda and got me a lemonade :) I was happy because that was the first soda I was having after a month. I took food/drink and came back to my office since it was time for meeting. I only had about ten minutes left before the meeting so I took my first bite after washing my hand. There was something about the taste which felt weird so I took another bite and it's that same weird taste again. Come to find out, the onions were bitter (maybe bad ones). So I decided to take a sip from my drink, even the drink was weird. The drink was so weird, I couldn't even drink any more. At least I was about to take the onion out of my burrito and eat the rest of it.   So my friends, ok service, bad food and bad drink.... don't you think 3 star is being generous?  Oh.. btw their chips are always half cooked.. what's with that?"}
{"text":"Not much taste in their food. Steak tasted like in was soaking in water, queso dip tasted like paper. Had the steak quesadilla, tortilla had the most flavor of anything."}
{"text":"Stopped by Moe's one evening in a rush to do some work at the hotel while on a business trip in Charlotte. The food was decent. None of the ingredients were warm like you'd expect it to be for a burrito bowl and honestly it obviously wasn't fresh but it didn't taste bad and hey, it's fast food and service was quick like I needed it to be. The staff is very friendly and greet you in unison when you walk in. The food handlers were pleasant and attentive. The cashier is where the experience got interesting. After signing the receipt to pay for the food I waited, as one usually does, for the receipt. The cashier was tending to something when he realized I was still there...apparently to his surprise. When he then asked if I wanted the receipt I replied nicely in the affirmative and he says, \"well, you could've grabbed it\" then handed me the receipt. Hilarious, for TV. A good line for a sitcom for sure. Real life, where customer service matters in a customer facing role, not good."}
{"text":"They really do have healthy, fresh ingredients, but your taco isn't going to have a lot of flavor unless you dump salsa on it. Also my hard taco fell apart in a minute cause their steak made it too soggy. They do have 5-6 free salsas, and the touch screen soda fountain. Their queso doesn't taste like real cheese to me, but it's alright! I like Chipotle better, but Ill be back here if convenient!"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre, and not worth the price for me. $21 for two people at lunch. Guacamole was terribly bland and the \"salsa bar\" was interesting. It was my hubby's birthday lunch and he wanted Moe's so... \"Welcome to Moe's!\" Wow that gets annoying."}
{"text":"From 5 stars down to 2! We normally make this a Friday night dinner every week as a family. The last few weeks have been dreadful. Having to deal with the eye rolls from employees for simply walking in the door!! When Patricia was here in the evenings it was so pleasant. Greeted with smiles and great customer service. Lately the food has been awful as well. Goes hand in hand with the attitudes of employees. Maybe, just maybe, you should have your pleasant workers down for your busiest times. I also bet if you did a surprise drug test a few employees would duck out as fast as they could. Eyes glazed over and cannot comprehend simple tasks.   We would drive from Charlotte to come to this location because it used to be that good! Not anymore!!!     Best Moe's around with wonderful employees. Clean dining room with nice seating. Definitely recommend and we will continue driving from Northlake area to come to this location!  Great customer service! Patricia and her team are amazing!"}
{"text":"96.5 sanitation score should've driven me away. Steak was old and a little crunchy? Employees need to smile more and actually act like they want/need their jobs. A girl without a name tag was rolling burritos, cleaning the dining room, and stocking supplies with what appeared to be the same gloves she was wearing to roll burritos. Gross! We will not be back. Save yourself the frustration and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"With the lack of a Chipotle downtown, Moe's is my go-to for a tasty burrito or taco.  They treat vegetarians right, having a tofu option and the meatless options cost almost a dollar less than their meatfull contemporaries.  Lots of different options (all with silly names) spanning Burritos, Tacos, Quesadillas, Salads and Nachos.  Ingredients seem pretty fresh, everything comes with chips and salsa (5-6 different options).  Can be VERY busy on a weekday lunch but they move people through very quickly.  Outdoor seating on the square is also nice."}
{"text":"First visit at this location.  Got my favorite chicken homewrecker and had it packed with goodness as always.  Friendly and helpful staff.  In and out of there!"}
{"text":"The store is dirty the store manager is not the greatest. Went to complain about the level of cleanliness in the store gave me a ehh to bad kind of attitude."}
{"text":"My first time here. The food is so good! I got the Joey jr and I couldn't finish it. Definitely recommend to get queso cheese on your burrito. They give you a side of chips too! One thing is that the staff is so unfriendly. The guy asked \"what do you want?\" I told him the topping and he said \"anything else?\" And I was asking my best friend if the chipotle ranch wasn't too spicy for me (I have a low tolerance for super spicy but I like spicy!) and not even two minutes, the server said in an irritated voice \"ANYTHING ELSE!!!\" They all did not smile or ask how our day was going. There was a long line so I'm guessing the people come for the food, but I'm pretty certain they don't come for the staff."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff, Love the Monday special (5.99! Drink Chips Burrito) and I like the pork choice. Moe's Peach soda's pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and it is showing signs of complete manager neglect:  Half the tables were dirty and no employee entered the dining area the whole time I was there.  The drink machine looked like it hadn't been wiped down all day and almost all of the counters were dirty.  The meat was dry the queso was barely warm.  When I was paying for my food, the cashier was on his cell phone, counted out my change one coin at the time one handed (because he was paying more attention to his phone call), and shorted me a dime (which I honestly didn't call out because I just wanted away from such terrible service).  I'm frankly a bit horrified."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  Really hesitant to go here after the bad reviews. But Chipotle is too far for my lunch break and I HATE pancheros.  Really pleasant staff except for the cashier who was just fine. Assembly line style like all the other fast \"mexican\" places.  Huge portions! I got a salad and was completely full. Unlike pancheros (and to a lesser extent, Chipotle) there are so many freebies and add-ons here. At pancheros they charge for \"grilled veggies. \"  At Moes, they offer you three different types. Nice selection of garnishes.   Free chips with every meal. I don't agree with the previous reviewer that suggested they were store bought. But i do agree they're too salty. Salsa bar was so-so but they had a lot of choices and unlike chipotle it's free!   Coke freestyle machine and 4 types of fresh brewed ice tea!   Cheaper than the competitors. Allegedly their beef is grassfed, but for some reason I believe Chipotle more when they claim that.  Not quite as tasty as Chipotle, but blows Qdoba and Pancheros out of the water.   Also a little context for why my review is so enthusiastic. I had Panchero's yesterday and ended up throwing out my meal. Moe's restored my faith in \"southwestern fast causal\"  Only reason for 4 stars is because Chipotle is the gold standard and Moe's just isn't there yet. Solid second place though!"}
{"text":"First off, food was great.   But.. walking in to this place was like getting hit with a wall of sadness. Zero motivation or friendliness from the staff. They looked like they hated their lives. One of the staff members said outloud that she wanted a transfer because \"i would rather work anywhere else than here\"- this is a very highly unprofessional comment to make while your GM is present in the lobby.. obviously there is a staffing issue. I hope this place finds help."}
{"text":"My wife went to the Waxhaw location late one night (at 10:30, they close at 11:00) and the moron in charge (Joaquin) had already shut down the grill for the night. She informed me when she returned home that she asked for Steak per my request, but was told that they were out of Steak and the grill was already shut down for the night. I looked up at the clock and was only 10:50!!! They were open for another 10 minutes and had NO business shutting down a grill!!! In my business, you're open while your open and not just \"Part\" of your business. I spoke to Joaquin who did apologize, but it didn't turn my Chicken into Steak. I informed him that I would be in for lunch the next day and it would be on HIM, to which he agreed.   I when I arrived for my lunch the next day Joaquin was not there, but the Store Manager was. I didn't get his name (Curly blond hair). He was SUPER Cordial! Handled lunch with no issues and provided $15 worth of Moe gift cash for my next visit. I have been back and used the gift cash. Have had two great meals now since the botched one. Both one thier dime. I'm not ready to go 5 Stars yet, but if they keep it up, I'll be updating my review to 5."}
{"text":"Moes is a burrito place with pretty much all custom orders.  Although I have experienced better, I did enjoy my veggie burrito and Negro Modelo.  They play the Grateful Dead and all sorts of Allman Brothers here, and some of the locations have crafty little quotes by these musicians.  The service wasn't shabby, but the people could have been a little bit more enthused, they must be getting minimum wage."}
{"text":"First time I visited a Moe's and had some expectations due to others raving about their food (better than their other tex mex counterparts, etc)   I went for the grilled chicken salad, which was not too bad, not anything spectacular.  But the staff working when I went were hating their jobs there and not hiding it at all, not showcasing customer service, getting frustrated at everything."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and fresh .prepared exactly the way we want it. Huge portions. Great  deal on Mondays."}
{"text":"I was very surprised by how flavorful the food here was. I got the stack and was blown away by how good both the ingredients and salsa were. The salsas and hot sauces available truly complete the food and range well from mild to hot-- all delicious as well. The customer service and restaurant ambience were also perfect! Can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here after a movie and before the Cardinals first pre season game. They had a sign on the door, any burrito and a beer for $6.67. The burrito was as good as any I've gotten from Baja Fresh or Chipotle but obviously much more affordable. Beers are $2 each if you want more, and I think this place is the best kept secret at Westgate. I will be going there again! Give it a try."}
{"text":"The food was okay. Nothing spectacular. I'll stick to local Zabas. The staff wasn't too inviting. Didn't even welcome me in.   Plus how do you understand the menu?! Can't we just have a normal menu that says what it is not these crazy names?!"}
{"text":"Perfectly ample and fine Moes located at the Epicentre area.  For those that know the chain, know that the food is sub par and nothing really to write home about so what makes the difference is the people behind the counter of course.  This place has some friendly individuals working behind the counter the day I popped in but something a little unsettling was the lack of a manager I think.  I can tell it's a fun and lively workplace but there was a lot of horseplay going on in lieu of paying attention to me as the customer.  No biggie really, but for you that have ever walked into GameStop, it's that same feeling.  Like it's being run by 5, 17 year olds.  Hmmm....anyway, it's a good solid choice for food.  I particulary like the Joey Bag O Donuts."}
{"text":"Moe's is a pretty quick and easy Hispanic-inspired grill with quite a few different options. This place operates much like chipotle or Yafo in that you walk through the line and tell the servers what you want to add to your dish.   Moe's has burritos, quesadillas, and taco salads, as well as bowls which can be created to your preference. I typically go with the bowl as it tends to be the healthiest and most filling.  Unfortunately, Moe's transitioned from free guac to now charging for guac.  I have noticed that the last few times I have been to Moe's they have started skimping on the chips. Chips are free so that's understandable. Overall, Moe's is a solid option for lunch but there is nothing unique about it. I have no real complaints: the food is always fresh and has good flavor.   But in the contest of Moe's v. Chipotle, my heart belongs to the latter!"}
{"text":"This place has a similar layout as to Chipotle, but I like it much better.  More meat choices, including group beef and vegetarian options.  They also have a cheese sauce that they give with their chips that's delicious!  I hope they open up more locations over here.  The current one I go to is by the freeway and highly congested.  No ideal, but I still go."}
{"text":"Horrible. Very rude service. I had an Unappetizing bowl, the seasoning was strange-served with very greasy chips. Much prefer chipotle-even with their issues."}
{"text":"Very good quick, counter-service Mexican food.  Tuesday's kids eat free.  Billy Barou nachos is my favorite. What you get depends largely on who crafts it for you.  We've been dining here weekly for several years."}
{"text":"Credit must be given to the caliber of food. This is not a high quality burrito joint- nor is it a low quality Taco Bell type. It is somewhere between a chipotle/qdoba and a Taco Bell.   What you gotta give Moe's credit for is the amount of options... Chicken, ground beef, tofu, steak, and pork. The only thing they are missing is fish/shrimp and that's a little harder to keep fresh.   The burrito you get here is jam packed and the taste is pretty good. Ingredients taste fresh. Every burrito comes with chips, and my favorite is that the salsa options are numerous is free (like most southern burrito joints).  Some may question a 4 star rating but credit should be given where it is deserved. Moe's is a decent Tex-mex option that gives consumers a lot of options on what they want in a burrito- also inexpensive- and lastly in a region where Mexican chains are not as prevalent as they would be in the southwest. So there aren't a lot of tacquerias and Mexican options. If you want something fast- it's either chipotle, qdoba, or Moe's.   And Moe's is pretty good- I haven't explored all the options and meats but food there was a 3.5. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Im just gonna review on what i and my lunch companion ordered. I got 3 hard tacos with ground beef and cheese. The shells and chips were bland, the meat was seasoned well, but it tastes like its from a kit. What i did not know was that just a plain old taco is $3 each!!! I just spent $9 on tacos with not much of anything in it!!! My friend got the chicken stack. She every thing was bland and she could not finish it.  Id give it a better review if I didn't feel like ive been ripped off, but i do feel ripped off. Im never coming back unless they lower prices"}
{"text":"Welcome to Moe's!!! LOL!!!  This place was busy when I was here earlier in the week - busy as in a line all the way to the door!! That's good, right!?! I had to wait for about 5 minutes before I made it to the counter for my order. The first guy that started my order was surprised that I didn't want any beans - he gave me a look like I was crazy or something. (Dude, I know what I'm doing, I've eaten at Moe's before!!)  I went down the line for the rest of my food. You cant go wrong at Moe's!!"}
{"text":"I would just like to say that I actually feel this place should get 3 1/2 stars.    Love the burritos.  Not crazy about the salsa.  staff is super friendly and I love them.  Burritos are HUGE.  I love how they make them according to your likes in front of you.  A little bit over priced i think but not bad at all.  I could probably go quite often and if I am in the area I do."}
{"text":"Really really good for those days where you don't want your meal to have any taste literally at all. Two stars instead of just one because I'm not a burrito nazi. Go to Chipotle."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed when entering this location was how dirty it is. The second was that nobody said, \"Welcome to Moe's!\" The third and last was the health inspection score was only 94%. I ended up leaving without ordering. (Waited for dinner to have Moe's Monday at the Northlake location which is much cleaner with friendly service.)"}
{"text":"So yet again here we are with another Subway/Chipotle clone opening up. Went on opening day with a coworker. Long lines. Lots of people. This was several weeks ago now, all I remember ordering was a quesadilla of some sort and my coworker getting one of the bowls. We both remarked that our items were a little...bland. I had to go to the salsa bar to get some flavor on this thing. I'll go again, but not often. Hopefully next time it'll taste better."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Moe's, and it is slowly replacing Libretto's as my after-work quick stop. However, I think this location is laid out awkwardly. It's long and skinny (heh) and if you come in the wrong door, you have a maze to get through to work your way around to the line entrance. I think switching the end of the line and the cash register would help a lot. I actually have never tried out the magical Coke machine because I have not heard good reviews of the concept- everyone keeps saying that no matter what flavors you pick, the flavors the person in front of you picked linger in the spout.   Noms At Night Grade: B+. Open til 3 am on Friday and Saturday, but only 9:00 during the week. That balances out to acceptable nighttime hours, especially once you consider what they must go through during the post-club hours on the weekend. Poor things. It was quite entertaining to park myself by a window seat and watch the drunks during Mardi Gras though. I think I'm going to plan to do the same whenever the EpiCentre has another party."}
{"text":"I'm typically a fan of Moe's but this location is sub-par. First, parking is a major issue. You have to park in the parking garage and it cost me $7 for the 45 mins I was inside eating dinner. Second, they closed at 8:00, which is much earlier than any Moe's I've been to. Third, a majority of the containers with toppings were empty. The salsa bar and many of the tables were dirty. If you want Moe's just got to a different location."}
{"text":"I love this Moe's. I do online ordering about once a week from this location, they are always on time and always make my order exactly how I want it! One problem though was when we went into the store to get salsa, they were all out of the green salsa for the day (it was 11:30!!)"}
{"text":"Eat here at your own risk. I just spent the last 24 hours with food poisoning from a vegan burrito bowl. We're talking violently-spewing-everything-out-of-all-orifices-at-least-once-an-hour, wish-you-were-dead bad. Avoid this place like the plague it gave me."}
{"text":"Very good burrito and the fresh guacamole was so good. I will go back. It is in downtown Summerlin next to 5 guys. The staff was very nice and the restaurant was clean. They have a salsa bar to get your salsa to go very tasty not to hot. And you get free chips with your order. The chips were warm and they had the perfect amount of salt on them."}
{"text":"Here I am at McCarren with no time to stop for breakfast on the way. I hate TSA, but I love  TSA. Wake up earlier or end up at Moe's.  All reviews seem to say the food is edible at best. I rather liked it. Unfortunately, At 6:30am it's breakfast only. This means a burrito or a bowl. Egg & cheese, egg & steak or egg & bacon . Oh well. At least you can choose a bottle drink, fountain or a coffee.  Now the bad news. You are at the airport so for two breakfast meals and three drinks....$30.  Dems da breaks. In the future, wake up early and find the buffet at NY NY."}
{"text":"I don't want to compare it to Chipotle, but I sorta have too. It is direct competition. They both are fighting over similar markets, so what makes Moe's different from Chipotle. I am not going to say which one is better because they both offer different experiences.   Moe's has more have a selection of menu items (especially in the Vegetarian area). I love that. I tried the personal trainer salad, which is like a vegetarian taco salad. It was really good, minus the fact that I had to pay extra for guacamole :(  The environment was awesome. I love the fact that they don't play top 40 hits."}
{"text":"Their new reward program stinks! When the old one was ending I registered for the new one, it does not say download an ap it says thanks for joining...it had me enter my phone number which if linked to their old system of how many times I had been here should have set off an alarm for them. Nope thanks for joining... So today in line no ap no loyaly points. Already misses the loyalty points of the switch of. I'm not going to look for the ap if I had to find out about it this way. See ya Moes. It's been a nice 6 yrs knowin ya!"}
{"text":"Probably the rudest staff I've ever encountered in a dining establishment. From beginning to end, all 4 people we interacted with had zero customer service skills, well the first one may have but he was way too high to even fully function. I was clearly just a huge inconvenience to the other three who must have had better things to be doing. Don't get me wrong, I don't expect 5 star service ... However both my husband and I walked out (we got our dinner to go) feeling like we had done something wrong by ordering burritos & inconvenienced everyone we spoke to. We like both Salsarita's and Chipotle more anyway, but this is closer so we gave it a try...... Never again."}
{"text":"Service was great and portions were great for the price. I tried the restaurant because the online menu said fish tacos but none were advertised in house which I suspect must be based on location."}
{"text":"Very slow service but not employees fault, very understaffed They were also kind of rude and impatient  Hire more people!"}
{"text":"Food quality is terrible. Veggies lacked the freshness and I was charged extra for the veggie bowl I ordered last couple of times."}
{"text":"I've always eaten at Moe's whenever I visit the East coast so I was excited when I found out one had opened here in Vegas. Moe's earns a good solid 2.5*s but I've bumped it up to a 3 because of two things: one, they have burrito bowls that you can easily customize to be low carb (leave out the rice and beans) and two, they have a good, small salsa bar to spice things up!   This Moe's location is big inside with lots of easy parking (you don't have to park in the mall's garage which is nice). The interior is new, clean and spacious. The employees were friendly and welcoming and seemed happy to help newbies decipher the menu.   Bonus points for having one of those amazing customize-your-own Coke machines (with like 500 drink options). They also have Southern style sweet brewed iced tea.  Moe's is a lot like Chipotle where you go down an assembly line and tell the employees behind the counter what you want to add to your burrito. I love being able to customize my meal. Moe's doesn't have any seafood options but they do have grilled tofu (a big plus for my vegan friends).   I visited on a Tuesday night around 7 pm and the place was mostly empty. No lines and no crowds at all. I ordered a burrito bowl, low carb with no rice or beans. I opted for grilled chicken breast and I added extra meat (the steak). I was VERY disappointed with the portion sizes of the meat. The amount was SO puny that at first I thought they forgot my \"extra meat.\" I've eaten at Moe's many times and this was even less than the \"normal\" amount of meat at other locations. Be aware that they screw you on the amount of meat here.   Yes, Moe's is expensive for what you get. I left hungry and I added on the side of chips and queso (the cup of queso you get is so small they should be embarrassed to charge what they charge; it's about 5 bites of cheese) and paid extra for \"extra meat.\" The chips are bad, don't waste your money.   I think the expense in relation to the portion size would make me not eat here too regularly. I know this location just opened so maybe the employees need training on the amount of meat to serve -- they just seemed to be SO stingy with the meat portions. At least the guy loaded me up with pico and cheese! Overall I'm happy to have another quick service Mexican style option in town."}
{"text":"This location is so bad I had to take to Twitter last week to complain to corporate -- something I never do. I've been here so many times (just look at my number of Yelp check ins here) but my visit last week was the last straw.   I love Moe's so much but this location is terrible. It's slowly gone further and further downhill to the point where I can no longer eat here. It's a shame because since this location opened I have been a regular, weekly (sometimes twice weekly) customer. But after my last visit on February 24, I walked out for the third time in as many visits. Moe's is 3 for 3 with strikeouts!   My most recent visit was at 12 noon on a weekday, a prime lunch time for all of the nearby office workers. As usual, I walked in the door and the place was completely empty. No customers, no employees. Sadly this is a common sight at this location no matter the time of day. Nobody there to give me that friendly \"welcome to Moe's\" greeting. After waiting a couple of minutes, an employee came out of the back, eating. Obviously she was having lunch or a snack and there was nobody manning the front of the house.   Related to the employee issue is the manager here -- she is almost always sitting in the back booth with a stack of papers, in plain view of everyone in the dining room. Often times she will be eating takeout food from a nearby quick service competitor like Panda Express or Subway. I'm not trying to get her in trouble because she is really nice and kind but seeing empty Chinese food bags on the table in a Mexican restaurant is just weird and isn't a good message to send to what few customers this location has.  This location has no customers so they never have hot food ready -- but they never have hot food ready so they don't have customers. It's an endless cycle that Moe's is trapped in, and that's what prompted me to walk out several times.   I ordered my usual burrito bowl so the employee scooped rice, beans and steak. I asked for peppers and onions (which are listed on the menu as ingredients in the bowl) and she said sorry, they didn't have any. I asked for mushrooms instead. Nope, no mushrooms. THIS HAPPENS EVERY TIME I GO TO THIS LOCATION and it's so upsetting. She didn't even offer to cook the ingredients for me, she just said they were out. Even when they do \"cook to order,\" I have to sit there for 10 minutes watching the other ingredients in my bowl sit on the counter and get cold. Forget having a quick lunch here, it's at least a 30 minute production just to get your food. I've had to wait for rice, meat and vegetables on nearly every single visit I have ever made.  The salsa bar is always missing something too. There are never any fresh limes or lemons and there will be a salsa or two simply missing. Not empty, just never there in the first place. No Splenda for the iced tea either, but I don't know if that's a franchise requirement to provide it (but worth mentioning since they used to provide it).   Their Moe's rewards system worked for a couple of months and then they just took it out. You'd enter your phone number on a keypad to record every visit and you could earn rewards like a free meal. I've missed over 30 rewards visits on top of it all. I get the feeling that the franchisee at this location is lazy which is sad because they are running their business into the ground.   I absolutely adore Moe's and I would love to go back to being a regular customer but I've just had enough. I'm not a complainer or whiner but I just wrote corporate and begged them to send help to this location.I hope it's not too late to turn things around here. My friends, family and coworkers all have similar experiences (I mean, look at these Yelp reviews that all mention the same problems) and nobody ever wants to eat at Moe's anymore because of these serious problems. This location has a terrible reputation in the community and I've never heard anything but complaints about it. I feel so awful for people trying Moe's for the first time at this location. When they do, I can almost guarantee they will never go back.    The sad thing about all of this is that the food is actually really tasty!"}
{"text":"Good food and relatively cheap. I tried this food drying an event so it came as a catering. But the food was still really nice! The green peppers and onion were tasty, and the meat were excellent! However the sauce were just okay, for the Guatemala or the salsa. But anyways, it is a good place for a quick bite or a group order!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick Sunday night dinner. It's a great place to order a quick meal and a nice family atmosphere. It has one of those coca cola machines that allow you to choose from different combinations of soda. They also feature a salsa bar for your never ending chips. The staff was nice and it's safe to say we will come back again."}
{"text":"If you could give a zero or a minus 1 I would. This review is on service not food, since I didn't order any. I walk in at 830 mind you they don't close till 9. Everything was clean and you can tell none of the workers wanted to be bothered with making anything dirty and weren't happy I was there. No greeting nothing. So I walked out after standing there a moment and seeing there irritated looks on their faces. I get this if it's 5 mins till close but with a half hour to go unacceptable. Shame because I came here often since I live across the street. No longer.  And it's 841 when I'm leaving this review so my time line is more than correct. Corporate will be called as well as a nice google review."}
{"text":"I love me some Moe's, but the service at this location isn't my favorite. I went around 12:45PM, peak lunch hour, to find a line about 5 people deep and only one person behind the counter taking orders, and he was moving very slowly (without purpose). One person was on the register, another was cutting up toppings, and there was another just standing around. After everyone in front of me was served, the employee standing around finally jumped in. I could tell he was new because he was timid, but the problem was that there also was no nearby supervisor guiding him, so it took awhile to take and finalize my order. I got my food in the end, but the whole process took much longer than it should have.  As for the food, this time I ordered the Super Kingpin with black beans and green peppers. It was actually very good and strong enough to hold it's innards. Another great order for vegetarians is the Art Vandalay burrito (comes with Guac on it!). Moe's is especially great when the chips are hot and fresh :)"}
{"text":"Really?  You go here or chipotle and think it will be authentic Mexican?  It is fast food with attitude."}
{"text":"Good food but its a bit pricey for the size of the burrito you get. Really enjoyed my burrito though and would probly come back when flying through Las Vegas."}
{"text":"it has pretty overpriced guacamole and it's pretty overpriced in general but i don't even care because it's bomb as hell. still a 10/10"}
{"text":"The chips were stale and when replacing the empty cilantro lime chicken with a new bag our server lifted the silver container from the counter and moved it over the prepped tacos, dripping dirty water all over the aluminum foil."}
{"text":"Moe's is meh. Bland Americanized Mexican food. Nothing special. Go to las velas or chipolte instead, both are in market square."}
{"text":"wow, so many bad reviews. Well, I like it. I mean the quality is not the greatest, but you certainly get more food than chipotle. I know there is a hype for chipotle out there, but moes is not all that bad if you keep it open minded and bring your expectations down a bit."}
{"text":"Decent customized American style Mexican food. Taking Chipotle to a whole new level as they have additions like grilled mushrooms and nachos. Had a carne asada burrito that I customized, and it was pretty good. Not amazing, but good for fast food mexican food. The queso was good with the tortilla chips they provide."}
{"text":"Thought I had already wrote a review for this place.   Don't show up here 30 min before close and expect a full menu. They were ready to go home. So sad people are so ready to go home that someone eating here the 2 st time might not come back. They were out of the signature queso which I don't find out till set down and took a bite of my food. This is the reason I come here. If they're were no queso I would just find another place to eat. So I kind of feel dooped into this meal. The rest of the food was okay. It would be like going to Michael Jackson Cirque and them not doing thriller... lol  been there done that.  Without the queso I wouldn't bother with Moes. Sad to have to write a bad review for a place I usally like.   Minuses  Out of queso Employees ready to go home and we're shutting down  Limited menu do to the above"}
{"text":"Friendly and courteous! The quesadillas are amazing and made exactly how you want them! In my opinion, the best quesadillas in town!!!!"}
{"text":"Since the line at Chipotle was almost 30 people long yesterday, I decided to check out this Moe's instead. I was surprised to be the only person in line after seeing the insanity at their Mexican food competitor across the street.   I ordered a Chicken Taco and Queso with Chips. The Chicken Taco was dismal. The quality of ingredients was much lower than what you would get at Chipotle. I was also barely able to eat the taco since it was so overfilled. However, the queso was delicious! I have been dieting, but I couldn't stop eating the wonderfully rich and smooth while mildly spicy cheesiness. Mmmm!   This restaurant really deserves only 2 stars, so they are lucky that their queso is so fantastico!"}
{"text":"Rude and poorly trained employees. They try to rush you through ordering, and when you ask for multiple add-on veggies etc., they look at you as if they were doing you a favor."}
{"text":"\"Welcome to Moe's \"  I love Moe's! I go every Saturday and they are amazing every time. I get the band camp bowl with black and pinto beans , which are amazing and perfectly seasoned. I am personally not a fan of topping (not Moe's but in general )so I stick to onions and green peppers and Guac. On occasion I will get their tofu on top! You also get complimentary chips... Yum!   I have always taken it to go but I love the interior of the building. It has a great vibe to it. Every time I go , I find my self enjoying it more.   The employees nail customer service! I get welcomed every time I come in.. So does everyone else. I always see the same people and we always strike up conversation!   They have an outdoor seating option for those who love eating outside.   Parking is a hassle, but that is not Moe's fault!   You can also sign up for their emails and get lots of cool information."}
{"text":"We've eaten at Moe's before but not this location. I remember being moderately pleased before. But this visit may have ruined me for ever eating at Moe's again. The staff were inattentive and not friendly. Hubby ordered a stack (Crunchwrap) and I ordered a bowl. Whatever seasoning they put in the pico was AWFUL. It just had a chemical taste. I understand seasoning can be a matter of preference so I can't dock stars for that reason.   But I can give a bad review for everything else. As we went to sit down I spotted SEVERAL tables that were dirty. But the restaurant was nowhere near busy. The drink station area was a MESS. Lids were running out and the pop machine and counter were sticky all over. The trash cans even looked gross.   Just an all over bad experience. Not going back.   Please, train your employees to focus on their work (instead of being on their phone like I saw one employee doing) and to realize that people are going out to eat for a nice, enjoyable experience. Instead we had to eat our sub par food in a dirty dining room."}
{"text":"I would rather have chipotle. The quality of the food was Taco Bell quality with prices which seemed like more than chipotle. Not a fan."}
{"text":"Sweet employees, friendly and helpful. I almost feel bad about leaving this negative review - almost. I swear the employees know that they work for a cheap A business. Like another reviewer stated, they are really stingy with the meat. I ordered the chicken homewrecker and I swear there were only about four small cube size pieces of chicken on there. When I gave the girl the stink eye she looked at me almost with shame. Then she tried to hurry up and cover it up with the burrito but I asked her to open it up again so I could see if my eyes were deceiving me. I told her this is ridiculous I'm not paying for that so she looked around very quickly and then she added more meat. I told her I know it's not you but I bet you hear that a lot from your customers and she agreed. As we went down the line and I asked for guacamole the guy gave me half of a tablespoon of guacamole - I gave him the eye too and he quickly added more guacamole. This is ridiculous. How are you going to charge almost $8 for a burrito that's basically vegetables? Again, the employees were all very nice and friendly. The one guy even offered to help me carry my three drinks out to my car. I think they are embarrassed to work there because I'm sure they hear this type of complaint from customers all the time. And I was nice to them about it and I told each one of them that I know it's not their fault and the guy said yeah it's not my fault."}
{"text":"Every Moe's I've ever been to is delicious, and this one is no exception. The restaurant was clean; staff was friendly and worked efficiently to get your food made quickly. Unless you have a very large appetite, you can probably get away with ordering a junior burrito, which is very, very good. Their queso is out of this world! And the sweet tea is usually good, too. This is a quick and easy way to eat good and not feel bad about what you've just put in your body."}
{"text":"I can't believe Moe's only had three stars? What's up with that? I've been to this location twice and never had an issue.  Moe's, by far, is my favorite chain Mexican restaurant. The value is great and you get so much food for the money. I get the \"Homewrecker,\" which is a delicious and huge burrito, filled with everything you want and your choice of meat and beans. With that includes chips and your choice of salsa at the salsa bar (I like being able to get the salsas myself!). The big burrito, chips, salsa and a drink all for under $9! I also love the fact that you can fit all the crap you want in the burrito and somehow it all stays together and doesn't fall apart. As much as I love Chipotle, the free chips gives this place an edge when it comes to deciding where to go for quick Mexican. The staff is also very friendly as well."}
{"text":"We visited Pittsburgh for the first time last weekend and found Market Square, which is the obvious downtown destination spot.  We looked around for an authentic mexican joint but couldn't find what was online (closed, perhaps?) so we ended up going to Moe's.  Moe's is like Chipotle is like Baja Fresh is like QDoba...you get the idea.  These are all counter service establishments that serve cafeteria style - pick your type of food, your meats, your fillings and customize your order.  I'm not generally a fan of this type of food and some of the things they get wrong like the rest of the chains do.  For example, they skimp on the meat - you get one spoon ladle full and the rest is fillings (I did not ask for double meat - you might try to!).  The meat itself is decent, but not what you're going to get with the places that do 'real mexican' - for example, I had carnitas but it wasn't anything like normal carnitas.  It felt like cafeteria food.  What they do get right is the same as the chains too - the ingredients are all fresh, the quality is decent and you can get a variety.  We ate in so it came with chips and I dug a number of the salsas they had.  My Carnita taco was passable and my girflriend had what amounted to a crunchwrap that was pretty tasty.  So, if you know what to expect and aren't too demanding, you can get some good food here.  And I don't know about the other reviews, but we found the service to be fine -friendly, warm and attentive."}
{"text":"This location is one of the better ones. The staff is competent, and food stations are well kept. The earlier you go, the better it usually is. But Moes itself lacks quality and flavor compared to its competitors. Aside from that, this location serves the Moes brand with the utmost respect.  Moe's Tip: the bowl provides the most for your dollar regarding food quantity. (tacos being the worst)"}
{"text":"Moes has been our go to for me and my girlfriend. We go on multiple occasions throughout the month. The options and choices you can choose from gives you many different possibilities to construct your burrito, bowl, tacos, etc. Staff is always very friendly and are very quick to get you through the line. If you get a bowl, I recommend their vinaigrette,  it is amazing! The salsa bar to go along with the free chips is also a fantastic idea. Love this place I will continue to eat here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I over look this place way too much. But the other day I happen to be driving by around lunch time and stopped in.  It wasn't very busy although it was almost 2pm so I think I just missed the lunch crowd.  Parking was easy in their lot. Service was great. Friendly and quick. The restaurant is clean and quiet. I got the steak burrito bowl. It was good. I love that they have several choices for salsa."}
{"text":"This Moe's is convenient to my work and I go here for lunch once a week or every other week. I like the fact that they don't always yell \"Welcome to Moe's!\" when people walk in the door because I find that stupid and annoying. The food is always delicious...my favorite is the nachos...and the quality of the ingredients is top notch. Depending on who makes your meal the portion sizes can vary between visits, so sometimes you get more than you can possibly eat and sometimes you leave wanting more. The employees are always friendly but I agree with other comments that the dining room could use some attention. Tables don't seem to get cleaned between customers very fast."}
{"text":"BEST MOES IN THE PITTSBURGH AREA!  Everything's always so good. I prefer Moe's over Chipotle. I like how Moe's has a cilantro free options."}
{"text":"Used Moes catering for an event for our managers. The order was for a taco bar, with fiesta bar and extra queso for a total of 18 people. The amount of food we received was embarrassing and I didn't receive the extras I paid for. Only 10 people was able to eat and I had to make a quick fast food run. I was so embarrassed that I used this company. The offered me a 20% discount on my next order as restitution.  Are you kidding?  Stay far far away from this place!"}
{"text":"Where else can ya hear the Clash and Wilson Pickett while creating a burrito masterpiece?  Frickin Moes, thats whats up.  My daughter and I make this our little lunch stop whenever we are at Great Northern or in todays case, the Metropizzarks.  This place always has kick ass coupons that make it a great deal!  Today we used a \"buy a burrito, little punk kid gets a free meal\" coupon.  We shared her burrito and nachos while I packed mine up for dinner at work.  The ingredients are fresh and they have way better selection that lame ass Chipotle.  Tofu (cmon Yelp hipsters...stand up and cheer), mushrooms, tomatillo salsa and chopped cilantro...I dont understand why burrito places always look at me like Im nuts when I ask for chopped cilantro!  This place gives ya free chips and have a kick-dick salsa bar.  Im a sauce freak so I usually try them all and have a salsa beard when I leave.  If you have one in your general vicinity, peep this place.  Its got a kinda Rock N Roll vibe and its not McDonalds!  Now all this place needs is beer and a glory hole in the shitter...."}
{"text":"I had an absolute horrible experience with MIKE, a so-called manager, who not only addressed me like I was a criminal but had the nerve to hang up on me during the conversation. I have already composed a letter to send to the corporate office about that moron who doesn't deserve to even be working there.  However, NEAL, the general manager, called me back twice to make up for that idiot's mistakes and took care of us. Neal was a consummate professional and made sure that all the needs for my catering order were met.  Thanks a lot Neal!  You are the reason I'm not leaving a 1-star rating."}
{"text":"Ok. Let me just start off by admitting that Chipotle holds the #1 spot in my heart for a fast, cheap burrito meal. Having said that my burrito was ...okay... The chicken was dry and the service was normal, not anything extraordinary.  All in all we just wanted to go eat somewhere that #1 would be fast #2 that we could sit and eat #3 had burritos and queso. Chipotle  on a Friday night is packed...So for tonight Moe's worked out and I was satisfied!"}
{"text":"Ok but our chips tasted stale. I asked for a $2.00 queso and I ended up paying 6. If you want something quick go here. If you want something good don't attempt Moe's"}
{"text":"This would be my second time coming here and to me it's not much different than zabas or chipotle, it's the same concept of choose your option and than add what you would like. I do like that they have the smaller options on their burritos granted you only pay a $1 less but it is a little bit smaller. They do offer free chips at least for eating in not sure on take out and they have a salsa bar. Salsa is ok not fantastic or out of this world but it is good. Really no complaints its a bit closer to home than any other southwest grill and prices aren't badly price also considering it is in downtown summerlin. Guess I made my review just a little to early, so I just watched the guy spray window cleaner on the windows that are in between the customer and the food. Now I understand that they are closing probably soon but you can wait to clean the window until the food has been removed or at least just spray a paper towel and then just wipe the window down if it needs to be clean not spray the window with the food sitting there covered or not there is still a tiny hole for the spoon to sit in the dish and it can get in there not sure if I would come back in the evening"}
{"text":"Waited here for 15 minutes after they were supposed to open and then Manager arrived to tell us they wouldn't be open until an hour after their scheduled opening time. She chalked it up to issues with her employees. Totally unprofessional."}
{"text":"Entire staff change.   They are polite and eager BUT help us all the portions are dismal.  Don't think I'm just complaining because I'm an overweight American but people, two (2), folks started their bowls and left once they were given measly shakes of meat.  Ridiculous amounts of protein were provided.  I was happy to wait for onions and green peppers (bell peppers for us real Southerners) but kind of shocking they didn't have all this on the line.  And, this is while a District Mgr was siting on the floor.   I don't know what happened to the older crew as I didn't ask but they are missed and I want to ensure my 1 freebie Rick or Dave (whatever the other manager was named) provided in place of my crappy crunchy rice burrito is on the books somewhere.  The green salsa is my preferred and seasonals as they show up."}
{"text":"These guys call themselves a \"Southwest\" grill yet pulled all their stores out of AZ."}
{"text":"I had never been to Moe's but had heard good things and am a fan of build your own type burrito joints so I ended up trying this place out one day when I was in the area and starving for some lunch.  I must say I was impressed.  Not only can you customize you order and watch it be constructed in front of you but they give you free tortilla chips and have a great salsa buffet to meet you fancy (so, of course I had to try all 5).  This is definitely my kind of place."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and friendly staff! Definitely would recommend and re order the steak burrito bowl!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try Moe's! Grand opening was great especially since all the big wigs were there! The next time I went the steak was dried out, the food was not consistent and what really ticks me off is that they measure every little piece of food in my burrito yet it comes with guac yet I barely got any. The staff doesn't seem to know what is going on and most of the food was either over cooked or under cooked such as the rice for my burrito. I really wanted to like this place but I guess growing up in LA and used to REAL Mexican food, this place is too American for me and the lack of flavors or creativity leaves a lot to desire!"}
{"text":"I reviewed this place before and I guess I just ran into a bad day.  This Moe's is like most: your typical burrito, quesadilla and taco joint with unlimited salsa and chips.  I always snag my Moo Moo Mr. Cow (a kids meal) with black bean, tofu and no rice. Seeing I consistently get this at ANY Moe's location I go, I can compare prices and this location is a WHOLE DOLLAR more than the one in Northlake Commons. Strange, eh?"}
{"text":"This week when I came here for lunch, before I could open my gob and recite my normal kid's meal, the guy working recited \"a Moo with black bean, tofu and no rice?\" and I realized that either I'm THAT strange they can remember what I order or I'm officially a regular. At a \"fast food\" joint.  The staff here usually are having a fun time behind the counter, the joint usually stays pretty spotless and they always have the salsa bowls filled. Around lunch time you'll only run into a handful of people from local companies sitting down for lunch and aside from Moe's vast array of music playing over the speakers, its relatively quiet.  If you're ever up this way and craving Mexican, I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Was a good meal have never had a burrito bowl before so I was kinda skeptical about it. It was fulling and yummy, the chips on the side was a plus. Wasn't too crowded and the staff was excellent WELCOME TO MOE'S!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and was sadly disappointed. i used to live in Pompano Beach, FL and there was a location not far from me and loved eating there.  So i was excited to see them here, i must say i should have walked out when i saw how dirty the place was , but being right after the lunch rush i gave them a shot.  First i was shocked how small the burrito was and it was the Home Wrecker, then once made the guy set it on the counter and moved on to the next order and i stood at the register while they did everything but ring me up, so by the time i sat down to ear my food was cold.   the trash cans were over flowing and i mean onto the floor even.  I will not return to this location at all and will warn others as well. The salsa bar was a mess as well and you could not even get to lids or straws due to and employee being in the way and she seemed to he lost in her own mind."}
{"text":"Everyone was very kind when we initially came in. The more we went down the food line, the more workers had an attitude. The food was okay, the steak was stringy and chewy. Not worth the price we paid."}
{"text":"Great foods.  Great prices.  I liked the greeting I received as soon as I walked in.  The Burrito I had was very good as were the toppings they offered on the side. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Yeah, Moe! You are an awesome people watching spot and your portions are reasonably sized. I LOVE the fact that you carry Dos Equis and that your staff shouts a welcome at you when you walk in the door. You are kinda like the East Coast Baja Fresh, only slightly not as fresh.....and your Verde salsa kicks mucho arse! Yum!"}
{"text":"Bought the bowl with chicken and all I can say about it is bland...bland....bland.  No seasoning whatsoever.  Even the cheese dip I bought on the side was funky tasting. Welcome to NO'S."}
{"text":"My goodness gracious.  What is going on at this location? I have been there twice in the last 2 weeks. Usually around 7:30 pm. Tonight I waited 36 min from the time I walked into the store until I paid. It was SO SLOW.  It was not packed. A decent line but I couldn't believe how long we waited. Also - the store in general has seemed to have go down hill.  It's dirty, messy, and the tables were not cleaned off.  Trash left over on the floor in a  lot of places.  They seemed understaffed and over worked.  I love Moe's. My kids do too but someone needs to know what is happening."}
{"text":"A bit slow service and not too friendly. Not mean though. Food was good and love the current hot salsa  the manager was organized and kept the team moving. Not 5 stars because it's not 5 star good quality but a great place to stop for fast casual dining"}
{"text":"Moe's is ok.  I'd been there a few times before Quesada opened around the corner, but now that Quesada is there, I'm not sure how likely I am to go back.  Moe's tends to be a little stingy with their ingredients (mainly the meats) and the place could really use a make-over.  I do like that you get warm nacho chips to go with your burrito, and unlimited salsa from their salsa bar."}
{"text":"After a long trip in Vegas all I wanted to do is get a burrito and relax before the flight!!!  The people at this place were so rude!!! I waited in like for like 20 minutes as they were working at snail speed to be told they don't sale lunch at 9am. There is NO signage saying you cant order lunch and the ingredients are there!  I told them I couldn't eat eggs and they were no help!  Lesson learned.  I will never step foot at this place again and next time I'll make sure to get something before this hell hole!!"}
{"text":"Deceptive at best.  I decided to use my birthday offer and  purchase an additional large amount of food for my family for dinner.  A woman, who did not speak English, informed me that they \"no accept\" the offer.  I asked why they advertise the app in the store if they don't honor any of the offers you receive from it. I was then handed the paper off the wall that I have added in the photos.  It stated that they have chosen not to participate in the offers and they are not aware of any stores that do.  I chose to go to Baja Fresh and the food was amazing!! I also received a burrito for my birthday and thanked them by spending another thirty dollars in additional food.  I will not be visiting Moe's again as they do not take care of their customers. They use the old bait and switch to draw unsuspecting patrons in only to rip them off."}
{"text":"The consensus seems to be pretty unanimous on this place. Chipotle-esque prices on a slightly elevated Taco Bell quality.  I've visited twice since their grand opening, ordering both in the store and via their mobile app. Generally, the store emits a positive atmosphere, as \"Welcome to Moes!\" is pleasantly yelled at you when you enter the restaurant. Each menu item is cleverlt titled in a confusing manner, so the easiest course of action is to treat the experience like Chipotle and casually work your way down the line.  The food, just OK. Certainly nothing to write home about, but I definitely remain an avid Chipotle lover. I will say the salsa bar is great addition, but not enough to make Moe's a necessity."}
{"text":"Great spot to get a bite to eat while in the terminal. Way better than typical fast food spots that are your other options - basically like going to a Chipotle."}
{"text":"The main manager here that is a big middle aged white dude, didn't care to ask for his name, has the worst customer service I've ever experienced. I've been coming to this location for years and he has only been here for a short period of time but it's steadily declining in the customer service aspect. I came here asking for a simple burrito...he basically gave me a half portion of protein, as the other half fell off and slid it on down the line. I asked for more since half of it fell off, and he said that'll be extra. Ok, sure I'll pay an extra $1.50 for something that wasn't even given to me correctly the first time. Then the people who work under him basically hate their job too. It's like an inconvenience that people are here for business. His shift that works with him, has glasses and sounds ghetto as hell, she also treats people like shit. This place has gone down hill tremendously. But the district manager or franchise owner will probably do nothing about it given the fact that the business runs itself. Stick a couple of people who can perform basic kitchen requirements and you have a business. People are here for the food not the people who work here but they could at least be the slight bit respectful. I hate yelp because people get it wrong with reviews, but this hits the nail on the head."}
{"text":"It's gotten better since they first opened up,with now two locations in mentor. At first you'll think it is a little pricey compared to Chipotle or Hot Head but you get unlimited chips,salsa and soda with your meal (Soda machine is one of those 100+ combination ones).   They change up the salsas quite often so the 3 or 4 to choose from are hit or miss. Sometimes you'll get a fruit salsa (pineapple,Mango or lime) and sometimes they will only have mild,med and Hot there."}
{"text":"I was happy to go to miss for the first time to night. It was my best friends little son was turning two so I got my two little girls and my husband and we headed to moes!  When we got there we got into line to order and they were very fast with our order. We got our food and sat down. The tables are very clean and the food was great! I ordered the cheese Quesadilla. It was very good. Overall I thought it was superb, but the salsa there was not the best, so I would bring your own!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience today. The tea was amazing and received service with a smile. The staff was very helpful when I spilled my tea. (Sorry dude). Everything was fresh and on Point! Love those home wreckers!"}
{"text":"Bland, less than fresh, boring. Totally not worth the calories. Service was good, but the food was not. Kind of pricy for that type of food too."}
{"text":"Still the worst moes I've ever visited in terms of cs. Its like they have slave labor working, the employees clearly hater being there! No \"welcome to moes\"; employees are very careless building your burrito and listening to what you actually want! Love the location, but hope they go out of business soon. Go to the market square location for an enjoyable and authentic moes experience. The Robinson location is just sad all around, cs, food prep, timeliness on food prep, and above all, the cs is the worst! No welcome to moes, with no line, its takes close to 5 minutes to complete your order. This place is a shame to the moes name! Send email to HQ to hopefully get then inline or revoked! Avoid at all costs! Visit their other Pittsburgh locations for a real moes experience!"}
{"text":"I've gotten food from here a handful of times.  It's pretty good and not super salty like Chipotle.  Plus you get free chips and salsa which rules.  My only complaint is that they are only open until 7.  It sucks because most of the classes on campus go until 9:50 and most get out around 9.  If they were open until 10 they would have me in there at least once or twice a week after class.  It's still a heavy meal and I don't want to eat it before class and risk falling asleep (grad school is not cheap) so I don't get to eat there as often as I'd like."}
{"text":"Was hoping to come try this place out after a hike at Red Rock and was disappointed to have a \"closed\" sign simply hung without care.  The food on the website makes it look like it would challenge Cafe Rio but guess that's not the case. Even the companies own website says they are open, which isn't true. Considering how many places have burritos and tacos, not sure I'll even bother trying to come back to this place again. Makes you wonder why they would close, health district shut them down? Treat their employees poorly so they don't have staff to keep it open? Doesn't matter now, lost this customer."}
{"text":"I come here sometimes because it's close to the office, and because Moe's serves tofu (unlike other places).   This location is consistent with what I've seen at other Moe's. I usually can pick out what I want and the person making my food will gladly customize my order, and even answer questions. Like when they introduced the new chimichurri sauce: being from Argentinean descent, I had to have it. And it was good (albeit not traditional).  I like how it isn't too crowded - even when lunch rush hits, they are quick enough and the restaurant is large enough to accommodate customers without a long wait.   Overall, it's a convenient, clean, quick burrito spot."}
{"text":"I thought the food was excellent!  I wasn't really expecting much.  When I went in there I really was not in the mood for any special type of dish but when I bit into the Homewrecker Burrito I was pleasantly surprised.  I may go back there again today."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with Moe's. I can't eat Chipotle anymore. Moe's has more options and more add-ins but what tops them amongst all other Mexican burrito places is their chicken. Oh and of course their queso and new chili con queso is great. I've had just about everything from their nachos to their stacks and it's all great. The stack is a must try. Can't beat free chips and salsa bar either. Moe's is the best!"}
{"text":"Fast food Mexican.  Definitely a cut above Taco Bell or Chipotle, they're fast and cheap.  They assemble it in front of you (from pre-prepared ingredients).  I like the selection of salsa for the chips-- take which ones you like, mix and match.  Televisions going all the time, but not obnoxiously loud. Food's decent-- ok place to drop by for lunch."}
{"text":"I became hooked on Moe's while in college, then I moved to Charlotte and found myself Moe-less way too often.  I would bounce around the numerous burrito places always asking for cucumber and chipotle ranch to be added to my burrito, but always getting the same confused look, and then a awkward \"we no have that mkay sir.\"  I was always forced to choke down a bland, sauceless, yet drippy burrito with only moderate satisfaction. Well, then came July 2011, and the opening of Moe's in the Epicentre.  (queue \"Hallelujah!\").  Needless to say, I was very excited, and I've been there 3 times since the opening, which is not nearly as often as I want.  However, as I've been distanced from Moe's over the past few years, I was not aware of their new approach to natural, organic ingredients.  This only solidifies my love for Moe's and creates even more distance between Moe's and everyone else.   This Moe's is excellent - fast service, friendly people, and a sweet friggin coke machine that mixes up all kinds of concoctions.    This is the best burrito in Charlotte.  Get whatever you want, and add chipotle ranch, that's all I'm saying.  I guess you could call it a redneck burrito.  We southerners like our ranch, but don't you worry about that."}
{"text":"I found the shift manager of this location to be extremely RUDE while he was preparing my food today. I walked in around 11:30 am on a Monday, hoping to beat the rush, and ordered 1 soft shell chicken taco. I wasn't that hungry, and that's typically what I get. The manager then said, \"You know it's Moe Monday\" to which I replied \"Yes, but I don't eat burritos.\" He then states in a somewhat snarky attitude \"A burrito is basically just a bigger taco!\" All along I'm thinking, Wow! Thanks for pointing that out, but I didn't ask for a burrito nor your comparison of one to a taco! I should have walked out, but I decided to stay. He then tried to push  their queso on me in an attempt to \"beef\" up my order, obviously annoyed by the fact that I was only spending $3 on 1 taco. He then had an employee ring up my order, and as I'm about to pay he sets my food down on the counter and mumbles \"uh... Later!\" What?!?!? I was blown away by the lack of professionalism! The one taco I did get was awful! The shell was hard and stale. Thanks, by the way for not steam pressing the tortilla like you should have. Maybe that costs extra! I won't be coming back to this store!"}
{"text":"\"Welcome to Moe's!\"   I usually hate when an establishment has some sort of forced greeting like this, but for some reason, I love it at Moe's. While the food is not better than chipotle, or Baja Fresh, or most other fast food burrito chains, Moe's has a couple of things going for it that I really like.   The big one is a different option than most. You can order the Triple Lindy, which gives you the choice between sour cream and guacamole. Since I dislike sour cream and love guacamole, this is perfect. Most other places (Chipolte) overcharge for gauc. Moe's on the other hand, charges you if you want both (the Home Wrecker) or the cheap option is one or the other (the Triple Lindy).   Moe's also has a pretty good selection of cheap beer!"}
{"text":"Cold food, rude staff. Slid their cell phone down the food line and could barely take their eyes off the phone long enough to make my burrito."}
{"text":"Welcome to Moe's! I'm a big fan of Moe's. I'm a regular here and I get treated really well here. The staff here is always super friendly, chatting about sports, the news, just about anything. It definitely helps to create a fun atmosphere.   The food. I'm a sucker for the burritos, although I've tried the bowls before too. Similar in style to chipotle and qdoba, and while I like the seasoning of the meats and chicken at chipotle, Moe's gets an edge for their toppings. They definitely have the most topping options compared to their competitors. A great example of thjs is their sautéed mushrooms. Always a good choice. Oh and the guacamole doesn't cost extra here.  I also am a big fan of their salsa bar. I'm addicted to the green salsa.  The prices are reasonable and if you come on Mondays it's only $5 for a burrito, chips and a drink. Queso is a little extra, but that's not so bad. They even have one of those nifty coke products machines in there. Love it.  Give Moe's a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Free chips and salsa with every order, need I say more?! I'll admit Moe's isn't the greatest Mexican food nor is it any bit authentic Mexican but in comparison to qdoba and chipotle it's #1 in my book. They greet you by saying \"Welcome to Moe's\" as soon as you walk in the door which already puts them a step above the competitors. Their food isn't outrageously priced like chipotle and now qdoba since they re did their menu. And on top of that you get free chips with your order and you can pick whatever salsas you want off the salsa bar."}
{"text":"I'm only giving it 5 stars because I'm in love with the food...shh don't tell.  Any who the personality and politeness of the staff could use some work.  I normally go to this one because sometimes it's just easier.  I've never had issues with the staff and the way they have treated me in the past.  So things have been good, I went to this Moe's on Saturday and it was bone dry no one there until I parked then it got crowded.  I went in and they did their normal annoying welcome to moes.  No big deal it's their thing.  Any who I ordered my food, I felt rushed so that was strike 1.  Once I ordered my food the guy who was actually fixing it act as if he was scared to give me the toppings I asked for.  Strike 2, then the manager I guess actually checked me out I asked for a bag to put my stuff in because I did order food for more than just my self.  Well he gave me the bag, I looked at him and thought WOW.  At that point I felt like I was at the self check out in a grocery store.  I can honestly say that this has never happened to me before, what happened to great customer service? I guess something simple as putting a customers food in a bag is too much work.  I was very upset by this, but I said ok no big I know how to put my stuff in a bag even though it was his job.  The high light of the visit besides how good the food is was the soda machine.  I must say that I'm not a coke fan but will drink a sprite with the best of them when I'm forced.  But this machine was amazing.  I was plesantly surprised about the choices this machine gave.  Like I said I'm not a coke fan, but I stood there for several minutes looking at the choices I had of sprite.  I was impressed by this and the food.  The employees attitudes suck really bad, they need a reality check. If the public is not something you want to deal with on a daily bases, then let me suggest getting a office gig some where."}
{"text":"I erased my previous review.  I had a concern about the pricing but just spoke with the owner (Mike) and he addressed my concern.  Very impressed how quickly he got in touch with me.  Corporate set some guidelines that he is working on fixing.   If you order a Naked Joey in the Bowl they don't have an option in the register, so you get charged for a Homewrecker or \"Earmuffs\".  Makes total sense now.  Earmuffs aka the rice bowl that was added to the menu in the fall.  I also mentioned the limited indoor seating.  Mike is trying to reconfigure the restaurant but he's at the mercy of the building owner.  This is the most efficient Moe's that I have seen.  They get you in and out very quickly.  I rarely see long lines.  Mike said they pride themselves on their efficiency.    Quality of the food is very good.  I always get steak with mushrooms, onions, peppers, salsa (tomato and corn), and cucumbers.  No complaints.    Lines are shorter than Chipolte.  When the weather is warmer they have plenty of outdoor seating. You get a nice view of what is going on the square (Market Square)."}
{"text":"Came here over the weekend with two teenage boys! Never been here before but my sons friend said the food is fantastic. My son is the pickiest eater in north east Ohio. He actually ate a whole burrito. His friend and I were quite impressed. My burrito had guacamole on it. It was called the home wrecker lol. My son got the one without guacamole. His had ground beef, brown rice, olives, green peppers, lettuce , tomato and cheese. His friend got everything but the kitchen sink on his!! He was actually dancing in his seat eating his. Each came with some salsa and chips. There is a little salsa bar with a few options of salsa. And you can take them home if you don't finish. We were all so full when we walked out !"}
{"text":"Server rushed me through the line even though no one was there. She didn't even ask me if I wanted any toppings on my burrito, and they didn't even have most of their usual stuff out. Food was fine."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today, employees were friendly and the Joey bag of Donuts was filling before I even got to the free chips. The Coke Freestyle machine is a bonus. I will be going here more ofter instead of the 20 minute chipotle wait or the Qdoba that never has any customers in it."}
{"text":"I ordered the Treat Yourself drink with tortilla chips & queso and two tacos. Delicious. The workers were good. Dr. Pepper tasted good."}
{"text":"This place was delicious. I ordered the three tacos... One chicken, one steak, and one pork. I normally like steak the most. However, here at Moe's I enjoyed both their chicken and pork better than the steak. I also ordered a small drink, tortilla chips, and queso dip. After I told the workers that I had never been to a Moe's Southwest Grill they were very helpful. There is also a salsa bar to top your chips and tacos with additional salsa. Good experience. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Had a good meal .  Moe's has a great selection, salsa  bar and the queso is good reasonable prices"}
{"text":"This is the only Moe's that I patronize.  I love the service and staff.  The food is always fresh!  No complaints."}
{"text":"I'm sorry John G. wrote such a poor review....especially considering he wrote this for the wrong store.  The manager is not Aimee; in fact it's a male.  It's a shameful dis-service to this store to write a review without truth or factual basis.  I'm am in full support of Russell's review.  Not only have I not experienced any problem, but I've taken time out of my day multiple times to write compliment letters to the company in regards to the exceptional quality of service I receive consistently at this location.    Get a job, John.  Keep it up Moe's Gastonia!  - Unbiased, but frequent customer."}
{"text":"Fast casual Mexican food,  $14 for nachos and a drink but huuuuuge portions so no complaints from me!  Watch out,  the jalapeños are hot hot hot. Friendly staff,  fast service,  fresh food. Yum."}
{"text":"I generally enjoy a homewrecker burrito and it is almost two meals for me.  I would like to give this a 4 but I cant.  I went in on Cinco De Moe's and they ran out of pork.  The employees were rather tired and they let it show.  It was an hour before closing so I didn't think I was so late as to merit stock outs due to they were winding down.  Especially on a busy day such as Cinco de Mayo.  They didn't say welcome to Moe's and that is a little thing, but they didn't say it because they didn't want us there and that is a big thing.  The food preparation was acceptable.  They started locking things down as we prepared to leave.  The dining area was overrun and needed more attention.  I am not holding this place to a gold standard but I have been to Moe's before and this location on this day was lagging.  The place is usually better but having such a bad day can't happen at a 4 of a 5 star.  Sorry Moe's but if you let me down again you are getting less stars and more importantly I will stop coming."}
{"text":"Not sure how they have an A (94) rating from the health dept. Place was filthy. Food all over the floor, drink machines were nasty. Our food was cold.  Rough when you get to pay for 6 people. I love Moe's, but won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Food is okay, free chips and salsa is nice. The queso is good and you can't get that at Chipotle but I don't think the food is as good. What really turned me off was the smell of the place. It smelled like a bathroom."}
{"text":"Very very very slow service. Staff was not friendly. They couldn't take credit / debit cards. Buying a gift card was a huge ordeal. Not a pleasant experience at all. Not to mention getting into Downtown Summerlin is a nightmare. One way in and out. Stop sign at entrance backs everything up onto the main road."}
{"text":"Poor service. I asked for a steak homewreaker and they put ground beef. I asked for one drink and they charged for two. Only reason they get two stars is because the food is good. I would recommend Moe's, but I would not come to this one again."}
{"text":"Ordered my nachos and go to pay with a $100 dollar bill and I'm told that they have no change. Like what business doesn't have enough change?!"}
{"text":"If you like cold meat, tiny portions, and no fresh ingredients then you will love this place. After LOVING Moe's in Florida, we finally found one across town and made the drive because of how much we enjoyed the Moes back home. To start the bad experience off with a bang, an employee was making food for a friend (possibly another employee on her day off) and ignored us. When she finished with her friend they proceeded to go sit at a table and have a conversation about some boyfriend drama...with lots of cursing. There was also no exchange of currency, so the friend was not charged for the food. At this point I'm covering my 5 year olds ears so he can't hear the language. We should have left immediately, but we had driven all the way across town. When another employee came to help us she was very nice. But there were no black beans ready and I was told I could wait 10 minutes or longer if I wanted some. I also got the last scoop of cold dried out chicken that was on the line. When I asked if there was more, again I was told it would have to cook. My husband asked for more beef on his burrito and was told there would be an extra charge. The only reason I gave them 1 star was because the queso is so good. By the way, I got the last of the queso so the next 2 people in line were told they were out. It took almost 20 minutes from the time we walked into the door until we sat down with our poor excuses for a $30 dinner. I also asked for a discount due to hem being out of ingredients and was told that couldn't be done. I have never wanted to ask for a refund or walk out without paying until now. It was the WORST experience ever. The only thing that could have made it any worse would have been bugs in the food or if one of us ended up with food poisoning. I won't go back and will recommend everyone not even try. Disgusting and disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and everyone's always smiling. They get through large lines really quick, highly recommend going in Mondays and Tuesdays for the burrito and tavo special respectively!"}
{"text":"All our orders were wrong, even though they were right on the receipt AND on the on-line order form.  And I'm not talking a little wrong, like one ingredient added or subtracted.  I'm talking HEINOUSLY wrong, like a sheet of sour cream on mine (which I didn't order) and chicken (I ordered tofu) and gobs and gobs of shredded cheese (I hate cheese.)  My husband got a full layer of cilantro (he only eats the cilantro in the pico; that's it!) sour cream (not ordered) and no meat at all!  My daughter got her own layer of sour cream which wasn't wanted (half the box was sour cream!) and pork she didn't order, as well as shredded cheese instead of the queso we paid the stupid upcharge for.  And what did we get for having to drive back to return to get the meals fixed?  A muttering, eye-rolling server who tried to mess up the new meals out of spite.  The only person who was apologetic was the cashier, who gave us the only thing she could; ten lousy Moe's bucks and a sack of dry chips.  Sorry, but Salsarita's is only fifteen minutes out of our way and they ALWAYS get the orders right!  We'll go there instead!"}
{"text":"Not the best food. I ordered the taco salad and the lettuce was super wilted and gross.  I would avoid this place and just go to the cafeteria."}
{"text":"I though Moe's was real good for an airport with the airport prices. The burrito was big and had a good flavor. Also there was not a significant wait which I have had at other LAS restaurants. I think some of the other reviewers were having bad days."}
{"text":"Food and service terrible. General Manager is rude and does not care if yiu are unhappy with the service provided. Instead he will go into the dining area to sit and chat with his friends. I will never return to any Moes due to the awful experience here."}
{"text":"Good place for a quick meal.  It's nice that you can build your own meal and choose from a vast array of toppings.  The ingredients are always fresh, the portions are generous, and the salsa bar is excellent.  Service is decent...about what you what expect in a quick service restaurant.    They are also community-focused, which is a big plus in my book!  They have catered several Cuthbertson school events (teacher luncheons, meetings, etc) and always set up a nice display and the food is always fresh and hot."}
{"text":"You people have absolutely got to be kidding with your reviews.  You prefer Chipotle?  Enjoy your crippling gastric diseases."}
{"text":"People are giving this bad reviews just because it's a fast food burrito place. That's ridiculous. It's a Moe's, that's what they sell! It's no worse or better than any other Moe's. If you don't like this style food, don't go there... geesh.  You already know what to expect. Go get your burrito and be happy, because it's the only burrito joint in the area."}
{"text":"I heard that Moe's was really good, however I was not thrilled with the experience. Just to give you an idea, Moe's is pretty similar to Chipotle but with a southern twist to it. The food was good but I was expecting a bit more from this food chain. The service was pretty weak and most of their employees did not know what they were doing yet! They offer nachos (they were huge), quesadillas, burritos, tostadas and tacos. I liked the fact that they have a lot of toppings you can choose from which are free of charge of course sour cream and guacamole are  usually extra.  Oh and did I mentioned that they have the Coca Cola lifestyle!! Yeee! Overall, a decent lunch/ dinner spot if you are looking for something quick! I will give them another try and hopefully their training curve will be over!"}
{"text":"The food was a little bland. The facilities were clean and the staff was nice. I would probably give it another try when I was back in Wexford."}
{"text":"I really only give 4 stars because of value. I used to go to Moes every Monday for about 6 months straight, I always loved it. It was $5, filled me up and tasted good.  I go less frequent now, not because I am unable, but I almost feel the quality is going down rather then up like its competitors. I starting eating at Chipotle more and the quality of food is night and day, by the taste and texture. I will prob still go to Moes often because it doesn't taste bad but only on Mondays. At $6, you are still getting a great deal with burrito chips drink and salsa. On a Tuesday- Sunday, I will be getting my quick burrito at Chipotle."}
{"text":"I placed an order online, when I got home I realized the cookies were not in the bag, the queso and taco were cold (I was there early too).  I called and spoke to Savannah regarding the missing cookies, I requested a credit.  Savannah seemed to be having a bad day and taking it out on me, she told me to contact the app.  I explained that I didn't use the app, I was on the website.  She said again, annoyed, I would have to call the number listed that she cannot help me.  Savannah went on to explain how this was my fault, that customers \"know\" to get the cookies as they are just too busy to get the full order for customers.  I explained to Savannah that I am new to the area and asked her how would I know to do that?  Savannah again annoyed told me to contact the # on the app.  Call ended and I look on the website as well as my email confirmation and both provide the location phone # and instructions to contact the location for issues.  I call back, Savannah answers, I ask to speak to a manager.  She informs me she is a manager.  I explained the website providing the location # only, also informed her that she doesn't seem helpful or interested in resolving and asked who else I could speak to for assistance.  She said I can speak to another manager - as she was handing him the phone she told him \"she doesn't think I'm helpful so here you handle her.\"  Although initially he also insisted there was nothing he could do, explaining they don't see the money - it's handled by a 3rd party, etc.... he ended up actually calling the MANAGER (neither person was the manager as I suspected) and said the manager will credit my card.  I absolutely would not recommend this Moe's!  Horrible service, employees present to be manager when they are not and ultimately they have no interest in helping customers."}
{"text":"Wow! I couldn't believe I was at Moe's.  No 'welcome to Moe's!' Offered on our arrival. The guy at the counter not rude but definitely not welcoming. The food choice was scarce and food that was there dry. The bowl I got was very salty. I highly doubt we will be going back there."}
{"text":"Moe's-Shmoe's! Nah I love this place! Honestly, if you're looking for a well balanced meal with healthy options galore I think this is the best option. For me, it's close to home to boot. Gluten-free, hormone-free, organic, vegetarian/vegan - all these are options on the Moe's menu. My personal favorite is the standard burrito on a whole-wheat wrap loaded with chicken, brown rice, black beans and at least one (probably two!) of Moe's signature salsa-style veggie goulashes. Think pico de gallo and then some. And I'm certainly an add-vocado kinda guy. (Sorry Subway, I'm stealing this. It's witty. Be happy.)  Skip all the food court fare at Northlake and stop into Moe's on your way home from the mall and get a seriously healthy, seriously filling meal instead. I guess my next step to healthy-living would be to actually walk over here from home. Sounds like a day unwasted!"}
{"text":"It was nice to see one of these pop near me in Fort Mill, since the area is still lacking restaurants. It's ok. I don't go that frequently. I prefer the other tex-mex brand.. you know the one that has the spicy chipotle in it's name - it shall remain nameless. But, this will do - at times - since we don't have one of those yet.  Very young staff. Multiple parts: careless, checked out, occasionally nice, worried about their own conversations rather than engaging with customers.  Place has been dirty a few times I have been there. Food has been okay."}
{"text":"This is a solid location for Moe's, but the lines can definitely get long - a fact not helped much by the fact that the staff isn't overly friendly. Sure, they help you through the line, as most fast food places do, but they aren't particularly interested in doing so with any sense of helpfulness.  There isn't much of anything else to report here other than they do have giveaways from time to time - but with the long lines and not-so-friendly staff, I'm not sure if it's worth it. They do have a Coke Freestyle, however. That's nice and all - but it can sure make the lines long when the person in front of you doesn't know how to work it (even if they do, it can make things take a really long time)."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my boyfriend over the weekend and was quite happy with the food. Both of us ordered the Joey Bag of Donuts with chicken each, and mind you, it's HUGE! Even heavier if you add cheese or sour cream or guac, but I didn't. They were out of mushrooms and for the peppers they only had green peppers (which is weird since we went on a Saturday afternoon), but I was quite content with it. I added the fresh jalapenos (should have gone with the pickled like my boyfriend) and hot sauce... which was a mistake. After 2 bites, I was picking out all the jalapenos and it was fine till I reached the end of my burrito. From then on, it set my mouth on fire and my stomach started to hurt. Then I figured out, I put my burrito upright and all the hot sauce probably trickled down to the bottom, thus making the end of my burrito super hot and fiery. I'm still thankful that I did get to enjoy the rest of my burrito and the sauce didn't ruin all of it. Also, the give you free chips with your order and their salsa bar has some very nice and flavorful salsas. I'll definitely go back and try to pick my ingredients wisely."}
{"text":"We usually get good service but this time it was below average. While waiting we ordered our food, that guy was friendly. He passed our food off to the next person and that girl was really nice. I got the burrito and my husband got the bowl. We noticed that they only gave us one order of chips. I asked if we each got one and the girl at the cash register said that we did but seemed like it was such a chore to get another batch of chips. She was super unfriendly and hardly said anything. The only thing she said was our total. I tried to get my phone scanned to get the points and the scanner wouldn't work. She didn't even try to help me and made it seem like it was such an inconvenience to her. She literally handed us the receipt and didn't say a word. One strange thing is that we each got water (we don't drink soda or tea) and she handed us plastic kids cups! Really?? Not sure if that's a store rule or her rule but that's just ridiculous. We ate our food at a booth and the girl that helped us with our food while ordered walked by us and was just super friendly and cheerful. I noticed her greeting everyone and she was taking everyones trash. The girl at the checkout needs to learn from this girl. Two completely different personalities. If it wasn't for this friendly girl, this place would definitely have been rated 1 star from me."}
{"text":"Gone here during lunch time several times and never had to wait long to go through the lines. Food is good. Staff is good. Restaurant is clean. I always get the burrito bowls. Yummy!! Chips are always good and crispy and surprisingly not really salty which I like compared to the other moes."}
{"text":"Got a to go order from here. Went right through the line and checked out quick. Sweet tea was good. Parking can be a pain but other than that everything was good."}
{"text":"Let me do you a favor by saying, \"DO NOT EAT HERE!\" This has been, by far, my worst food experience ever. Granted, it is Mexican fast food but in all honesty, this makes Taco Bell look like Michelin rated restaurant.   Let me tell you all the things that went terribly wrong...  - All of the food servers seemed like they wanted be somewhere else. I get it. Working in the food service industry, let alone fast food, is not everyone's ideal job. Again, I get it. I was there too. But to take it out on someone's order is not the way to go. Our server took every ingredient and practically threw them onto our plates. By the end it was a big sloppy mess. Which brings me to my next point.   -I got the burrito bowl and it was practically a soup. Since our server was throwing our plates together, she didn't drain out the extra liquid from the veggies/pico de gallo. I had about an inch of liquid at the bottom of my bowl. That's a big no no.  - The ice machine was broken. Ok, not a huge deal but this was not the only thing broken.  - Apparently their grill was \"broken\" so we couldn't order the quesadillas. But lo and behold, minutes later, it starts working again for other customers. I get that sometimes things are out of the employees control but seeing as this was not the only thing wrong with this place, I was not happy.   - The food was just not good. Maybe it was because the ingredients didn't seem fresh or because it wasn't prepared properly but, as I stated before, I would rather go to Taco Bell a thousand times over this place just based on their food.   Overall, this place was a big NO. How they manage to stay here based on the feedback customers have gave is beyond me. I've never been to a Moe's before this and because of the horrible experience I've had here, I doubt I will ever go to another Moe's again."}
{"text":"So glad that there's a Moe's close to my office. I love coming here on Monday when they have the burrito bowls on sale. And the fact that they use quality meats is great!  The staff here is amazing too!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Moe's, and this one didn't disappoint. Joey w/ chicken, brown rice, cheese, and chipotle ranch, side of queso, chips, medium salsa, every time. I had never tried their new spicy chicken before, so I opted to try it and was impressed. Only downside was the girl at the register...she was pretty but had an unfortunate and seemingly severe case of RBF, poor thing. Despite that, for my first time to a Moe's in probably 4-5 years, I am so stoked that everything tasted as good as it did back then, I'm going all out on the 5 star."}
{"text":"Two great things going for Moe's 1) \"Welcome to Moe's and 2) Queso. I've eaten soft tacos, nachos and burritos here. They give you a lot of options to choose from-black beans, pinto beans, different salsas, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and a few other things including proteins. They add chips to every order which is a nice treat. They keep the restaurant very clean and the employees are friendly."}
{"text":"My son and I went to Moe's in Bethel Park for their opening weekend. I spun the wheel they had set up outside and won $10 in Moe's food. Yes. Please. And Thank You. The line was long no but went quickly. I was impressed with how quickly their team worked to get the orders completed. I ordered chicken nachos. They have other options to choose from-burritos, tacos, and quesadillas. They have a wide range of topping-black olives, pico, cheese, sour cream, beans, and all sorts of goodness. In their dining area they have a salsa bar. They have mild to spicy and verde to red. We love options.  My nachos were very large and had the toppings I picked. I was bummed that I forgot guacamole. My nachos were good but quickly became soggy. That was disappointing. I'm not a fan of doofus chips. I got a fork and ate what was salvageable. I think next time I'm going to order my toppings in a bowl and my chips on the side. Their quest is yummy and I need those crispy chips as a vehicle to eat that quest."}
{"text":"The food was just ok. Ordered the homewrecker burrito. Also ordered queso which was decent, but the steak had no flavor. Tried 3 of their sauces (tomatillo, a medium, and hot) and the medium tasted good but the others were foul. Cashiers were pretty rude though. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Same story on lame Mexican restaurants in TO: tin-can-salsa, dry chicken, brown cilantro. And apparently the cashier accidentally sat in some Tabasco, as he was quite fiesty, and not in the good way. He took offense to me saying \"Gracias\"."}
{"text":"Love the chicken, steak, ground beef, queso etc.. great ownership. Glad to finally have one in bethel"}
{"text":"DON'T EVER GO HERE TO EAT! I'd give them a minus five stars if I could! It started in the service line where everything was filthy. Pans, serving utensils, the line, etc. We were hungry so we tried to turn a blind eye. We get to the drink dispenser and again, filthy, as was the salsa bar, which was mostly empty anyway. Again, we power through and begin looking for a seat. EVERY TABLE, and I do mean every single one, was disgusting. We found the least repulsive, cleaned it ourselves and sat down. As we began removing things from our trays each item felt as though the tray was soaked in grease, wiped off and then our items were placed on the still wet trays. We each took a few bites, one basket of chips was nothing but crumbs, and threw the rest in the trash. On top of everything else, when my husband asked for his military discount he was at first told they didn't do it. The manger finally stepped in and at least discounted his portion that ultimately went into the trash anyway."}
{"text":"I can't believe the reviews are so bad for this place! As far as airport food/prices/service go, this place is great!!  The burrito was big and all the condiments looked fresh. Okay, not the most AMAZING burrito ever, but let me reiterate... For airport food it was excellent!  p.s. And this is just a little quirk of my own, but I don't like when one item gets all bunched up in one position of my burrito... I like things to be evenly spread out. They need to work on that here."}
{"text":"My gf really likes Moe's but I'm a Chipotle guy. I like Moe's nachos but veggie, Moe's chicken really lacks flavor. I really like the salsa bar and chips with all meals. Over all a good alternative to Chipotle"}
{"text":"Better than the other Moe's in mentor, but not as good as Chipotle. Moe's is a great alternative to Chipotle, they do many things better such as the Chips, the chips are fresh, perfectly salted, come with every meal, and with unlimited salsa. I got a homewrecker burrito this time. I wasn't a huge fan of there chicken before but now they have a smokin chicken which is flavored with smoked jalapeno & honey-glaze. That was pretty good. There rice isn't as good as chipotle's and they didn't have white rice which bummed me. Also there peppers and onions aren't as good as chipotle. However some things I do like is the cilantro and jalapenos also the southwestern ranch sauce. They have queso which everyone enjoys but it hurts my stomach. Overally the burrito was good and satisfying. It was folded nicely. The restaurant was clean and the staff was nice."}
{"text":"I've been going to MOE's for years now, and LOVE the place!  Their selection of truly fresh foods is excellent, and the large selection of toppings and salsa bar is second to none!  I find the employees there kind and competent, and the atmosphere pleasant and clean.  I actually prefer MOE's over Chipotle or Qdoba.  A winner in my book!"}
{"text":"Friendly service.  Food was prepared well.  The dining area was kinda dirty."}
{"text":"I love Moe's, but it was freezing in the seating area with the door opening constantly.  Great burrito as always."}
{"text":"I love burritos and usually Moes but have not had a lot of success at this location. The food is ok but the service is poor."}
{"text":"First timer, and wasn't really impressed. Staff was in la la land, and it wasn't busy. Portions were ok but Chipotle has better burritos in my opinion. It was fresh like the lime dressing but not very excited about their food. Can be way better!!"}
{"text":"The food was really good and you get a lot for your money! I got the Joey Bag of Donuts with Steak! They have a lot of toppings and a good salsa bar bag INCLUDES all you can eat guac!!! :) the people who worked there were really nice and the food was fresh!! We just moved to the area and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. Avoid Moe's at all cost!   Staff were friendly, albeit they don't keep the place clean. I also have doubts the way they handle my food.  I ordered the bowl with rice, chicken, mild salsa, corn and chicken. My food tasted horrible :( everything was stale. The flavors made me nauseated. Gross!"}
{"text":"If you're anything like me, the question you have is \"Why should I eat here rather than Chipotle?\" and I'm glad you asked. The answer is: \"because it's something different.\"   I had my first experience eating at a Moe's Southwest Grill on a Sunday evening a few days after this location's grand opening. There were about 20 people dining in the restaurant with room for plenty more. I was greeted by a few employees as I walked in the door and definitely felt welcome! Everyone seemed to be smiling and enjoying their evening.  When I went to order I had a hard time figuring out how to decipher their menu. Everything had weird names such as \"Joey Bag of Donuts,\" \"Funk Meister,\" \"Billy Barou\" etc. Eventually I figured out that pretty much all the options under each category (tacos, bowls, nachos, stacks, etc) are the same. You have a meat option, a meat option with guacamole, and a vegetarian option. As a general rule that is pretty much the only differences between the odd names. You could get around this hassle by just ordering \"taco with guacamole\" rather than \"the overachiever\" and I am sure they will know what you want!  Once you choose what type of item you want the rest of the process is very much like Chipotle where you can tell them exactly what ingredients you want on your item. It was nice that they have about twice as many options as Chipotle. You can get grilled onions or peppers separately and they even had grilled mushrooms, pickled or raw jalapenos, cilantro, olives, queso and many other options.  One nice benefit is they give you free chips (dumped in the bag on top of your other items) with every meal. And then you have your choice of as much of the 6 difference salsa options as you want from their salsa bar.  I ordered nachos and a taco which came to about $12.50. So the prices are inline with chipotle and the portions seemed even a little bigger. I do think that it would be easier to eat cheaper here than at Chipotle though since tacos can be more easily ordered individually and there are a lot more menu options to choose from.  If you stop reading right here this feels more like a 4 or 5 star review but you may be left with one more question. You are probably wishing you could ask something like: \"Hey Aaron, how did it taste!?\"  And again, I'm glad you asked; I appreciate that you value my opinion! The simple answer is that it tasted OK. The quality of the ingredients were about 1 step below Chipotle and 1.2 steps above Taco Bell. It seemed like a lot of the food was pre-prepared and not made at the store and there was definitely a noticeable difference in the quality of meat. The more Americanesque ingredients were definitely more akin to Taco Bell and I think If you were to blindfold someone and give them a taco from Moe's while telling them to guess if were from Taco Bell or Chipotle I would imagine that nearly everyone would believe it were from Taco Bell before believing it were from Chipotle.  So do I think you should eat here? Sure, why not. I'll probably visit again. It is something different for a change and was not at all bad. It has a fun atmosphere and there is plenty of room for even a big group to dine together.   But the food is just OK."}
{"text":"Honestly if they want to stay in business they will need to step it up. I decided to go there twice since my first experience which wasn't very enjoyable.        Let's start with the protein. I've tried the chicken, steak and chili con queso. The chicken is under seasoned. The steak is over cooked. I did not enjoy the chili con queso on my burrito. It had a strange taste. The black beans are dry and have no flavor!       The salsa... Eek. I did not find one that I liked. Either of the times and neither did the people I went with. Are you guys taste testing your food before you put it out?       The queso sauce isn't bad, but could use some diced jalapenos. The mushrooms and onions have no flavor, they just add texture. As for the chips, well chipotles are way better. I have to say that I am very disappointed. I was expecting a chipotle type restaurant with more choices. :("}
{"text":"My first time at Moe's was today at the airport. I ordered the chicken salad and it was pretty good. I'd say the food is a thumbs up, but the prices are insanely expensive. Yikes!"}
{"text":"First thing first, this place may not be my ultimate favorite tex-mexy type place, but the people complaining about the wait...in Downtown...at lunch time...well, that's just silly. EVERYWHERE is packed. Even Subway is packed at lunch time and everyone knows that place is garbage. I suggest ordering online; it's easy and eliminates A LOT of the wait. Just be careful because for some weird reason they \"pre-select\" some things when you order online and have to un-select them if you don't want those items.   Now, the food. I got the salad with chicken and a bunch of veggies. It was pretty good. It was no Chipotle, but good. I liked the chicken and the fact that you can get so many different kinds of veggies in your salad. And I will say this, the burritos my friends got looked yummy. They also have things that Chipotle doesn't offer, like queso and a spicy ranch for your salad. Plus, there's a whole salsa bar where you can pick any and all the salsas you want. And one thing that is waaaay better than Chipotle is the chips. I always find Chipotle's to taste stale, but Moe's were crispy and fresh and didn't just taste like oil. I tasted my friend's taco, with ground meat, which screamed taco bell to me, but if that's your thing... Overall it's not my favorite but I really like some of the things that Moe's offers that other places don't. And there's always the bonus that you're paying for a bowl full of listeria or whatever else Chipotle decides to serve up that day. And with the rising prices and diminishing portions at Chipotle, it's nice there's other options out there."}
{"text":"What better place to hit for Cinco de mayo than Moe's? I don't eat much Mexican food but out of all the fast food taco places Moe's is probably my favorite. There's just something about walking in and being screamed at in a greeting \"welcome to moes\" on this particular trip I came down to celebrate and get the free shirt. I got there around 1040 with a line already outside. They ended up letting us in 10 minuets early because there had to be already 30 people. On walking in of corse they screamed and everyone seemed so happy it was truly the best greeting yet. Everyone was so happy and so stoked on the food. I grabbed two crispy taco loaded up with all the fixings because why not? I had to have only waited maybe 4 mins from walking in the door to sitting down to eat. Everything was so fast and tasted great and I'm so stoked on the sweet new threads. Another thing that I love so much that makes me a proud moes customer is they have the most amazing salsa bar and a freestyle machine. If I'm ever craving moes again I will make sure I come to this location because it was such a great experience! Much love to the taco kings!"}
{"text":"I moved to the area about 7 years ago and have seen this place just slowly decline to one of the worst places in the area. The tables are hardly wiped down, trash is overflowing, the food has become extremely salty, and they have an ice machine that NEVER has ice! Tonight was the final straw, just disgusting atmosphere and the food was way over salted and ruined the flavor of everything! If you look at Moe's website, everything the company says what they stand for, this location is not.  I have given this place the benefit of the doubt because I live so close and have been a fan of Moe's for a very long time. \"Welcome to Moe's!\" was always a great feeling walking in and at least in this location, they stopped doing it awhile ago.  It just seemed like this place just doesn't care anymore. Convenience in location is no longer acceptable for me to ever come here ever again and I recommend to anyone, don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"This place was pretty damn good.  It's like Taco Del Mar, but better.  You can get sauteed vegetables put in your burrito or tacos and they even have grilled, seasoned tofu!  I'm in heaven.  All the menu items are names after pop-culture references... I had \"The Ugly naked Guy\" a la Friends.  I was amused.  I guess the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because, in the end, it's just a cheap taco joint... but if you are in the mood for that, hit it up!"}
{"text":"I found this place after getting something in the mail and thought I would check it out.  I was so glad that I did.  It's easy to find, on the Southeast corner of Kyrene and Elliot in a shopping complex.    This place is great. It's kind of what I would call a \"fajita bar.\"  Basically, they have a menu, but you pick and choose basically how you want to build your food.  They have Tacos, burritos, fajitas, all made to your liking.  (think Subway here folks, but substantially better.)  I ended up getting the steak burrito, (I think it was on the menu as a \"joey bag of donuts) and it was yummy! Very tasty. IM STUFFED.  You choose what kind of rice you want, toppings, steak, chicken, etc.  They have a nice variety of food to choose from.  you can get a combo thing with chips and a drink, or just a burrito/taco/fajita alone.  Either way, your going to walk out of here with a TON of food.  I liked this place because its fresh and hot, and theres variety.  I guess being that I grew up outside of AZ, I wasn't raised on southwestern food, so Im learning to grow a taste for it.  I feel like this is the place I can enjoy good casual dining, for a good price, and enjoy the flavor of the southwest on my stomachs terms.  The only thing I did not like was that I felt like the service could have been better.  I had lots of questions about the menu, and how things work here, since it was my first time to this place.  I kind of felt like the guy behind the counter didn't want to take the time to answer my questions that I had, and when I asked him questions, basically he pointed to the menu and that was hius way of answering me.    Some kind of positive interaction would have made this a 5 star event."}
{"text":"Moses the best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to good prices free chips with the purchase of a meal and if you build up enough points to get a free meal I will never go to Chipotle again lol lol"}
{"text":"The food quality was horrible, especially for being so expensive. Chipotle is so much better and less cost.  Not just was the quality bad, but the taste was just gross. So disappointing. Definitely wouldn't return. Staff was ok... kind of immature and seemed like they really didn't want to be there. Dining room was clean-ish. High chairs were filthy."}
{"text":"Just ate there last night, and I've gotta say, the queso dip gets me every time!  There are several things I love about Moe's: 1.  The kids always want to go because of the cookies 2.  The queso dip has no MSG 3.  The meat is hormone free, the other food is all natural 4.  They always greet you when you come in 5.  The price is great! We eat at all the locations around, and this one by far is the cleanest.  So if you like burrito bars, and want a little more selection than at other ones (I love you, too, though!) and that queso dip is calling your name, then Moe's is a great choice."}
{"text":"Big fan of Moe's. I find myself going to this location at least once a week. It is very clean and the staff are very nice. I love the salsa bar and always leave happy and full. I typically get the chicken stack which is kind of like a Gordita crunch except bigger and better. I love the chicken and fresh jalapeños. The queso is also very good. Unlike Chipotle, the chips come with the meal and you can beat the options at the salsa bar. Usually busy, but the lines move extremely fast."}
{"text":"Easy quick meal while in the airport . Line was long , but food was served quickly. Only complaint was the food was cold. Taste was decent tho, for being located in a airport"}
{"text":"My friend told me that Moe's might be better than Chipotle, so I had to investigate.   For one thing, they have more add-ins than Chipotle. They have jalapenos and black olives, which are two of my favorite toppings (besides meat). I prefer Chipotle's sofritas compared to their tofu, which is more plain. They look pan-fried or baked, but don't have as much flavor as the sofritas. I like my burrito or burrito bowl with half steak and half of the vegetarian option.  They have free chips, however mine were cold. Their salsa is also free, via the salsa bar. I love salsa. The super spicy (red) one is actually so spicy I'm impressed! I could drink their verde (green) sauce.   The staff is friendly, and it wasn't crowded at all for an afternoon. The seating outside was nice and a great people-watching spot of Market Square.  For the price, quantity, and quality, it's on par with Chipotle."}
{"text":"Despite being only 2 people working during our visit. While standing in line the mad lunch rush dashed in line behind us. This place is like chipotle but better! They have stacks which are like tacobells crunch wrap. The food is fresh and portions are about right. They have a salsa bar that my kids fell in love with. The lobby was a mess but the staff was friendly and apologizes numerous times. I enjoyed it, my kids were super impressed with the soda machine. You'll have to visit in order to understand their amazement. Will for sure come back. Only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because of the fact they were short staffed and I had to clean my own booth."}
{"text":"I went here during lunch after a pokemon go break.  I ordered the beef nachos for 9 dollars and then you select your ingredients. Customer service was terrible.  They were stingy with their cheese and guacamole and I asked for a little bit more cheese and normally they would do it.  This person said it will cost you more.  I asked for everything else on there and wanted more corn but even that cost more.  The guy was rude about it.  Anyways I like Moes.  But the person served me was rude"}
{"text":"Sorry, this doesn't cut it as \"southwestern\" or Mexican food at all. The food was bland, the chicken was not fresh at all. The cilantro was dry and flaky... Maybe I'm just a spoiled snobby Californian. The service was very friendly and the salsas weren't bad. I'll give them that!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this on my laptop as I sit on the toilet - it has been less than 1 hour since I ate there. This is round 2 of what I predict will be at least a 3 round battle between my stomach and Moe's *courtesy flush*. My girlfriend is currently having her own private battle in the other bathroom.  I had a steak burrito and she had a chicken burrito. I didn't eat beans or rice and she did. The only things we had the same were the tortilla, the chips, the cheese, and the diet soda... why we are both ill off this, I don't really know. I started to feel the 'gut rot' as I took my last bite.   The steak tasted somewhat odd - I figured it was the sauce it was soaking in... the meat was very drippy and soggy. The chips were stale and bland and looked like they came out of a bag. I'm told the chicken was pretty mediocre.   The fake-nice we encountered when we walked in was kinda irritating to me, but I'm sure it's fun if you're in that kind of mood. I guess I wasn't. The atmosphere was less than special as well. It reminded me of Peter Piper Pizza.  I think the problem is that I went to Chipotle before ever going to Moe's. I was spoiled. Fresh ingredients, much of it organic, and a classy atmosphere. Moe's is just barely a half-step above Taco Bell, but with Chipotle prices.   I understand that this place is really busy during lunch, and I went in the evening - perhaps when it's busier, the food is better?  I'm never going back - apart from the food giving me assplosions, it tasted pretty awful (especially compared to Chipotle). Anyway - this place sucks... boo-hiss."}
{"text":"It's like Chipotle, except way smaller.   ...Or maybe my appetite increased 3 fold.  $5 Any Salad on Thursday!"}
{"text":"Expertly crafted burrito that tasted better then Chipotle.  That's right, I said it!  With Moe's you get a free side of chips and a variety of salsa's to sample as well.  It's a fun-filled atmosphere with great food.  This was my first experience dining at Moe's and I left satisfied.  I can't wait to come back in the very near future."}
{"text":"They can make a platter GF.  Over rice, they did change gloves and all.   Food quality what is expected from a fast food restaurant.    Good to know that in a pinch where no better restaurant available you can eat at a moes."}
{"text":"Just an all around disappointing experience.  Unpleasant and abrupt staff.  Woman behind counter: \"what else!\" \"What else!\" \"What else!\"...  very dirty tables and other areas.  (If you're not going to clean the tables leave out the cleaning spray and cloth so those inclined can wipe down the table.)  Chicken on Nachos was black and rice was crunchy.  Also not very many chips."}
{"text":"So we are from South Carolina where there are many Moe's restaurants. After almost a year of living in Vegas we have desperately missed the \"Welcome to Moe's\" when you walk in the door and the taste of their yummy quest dip. We are glad we can now go anytime we want I Downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"I've been going to Moe's since high school when I would get it as a treat during a break from working the lame part time job.  I would say this was the weakest quality of food and service I've experienced at a Moe's before.  My group didn't get welcomed upon entrance and those that did received a disenfranchised welcome muttered under their breath.  The food was okay, but nothing like I remembered it (even accounting for the healthy transition they made).  For the price increase, I got maybe a handful of chips and a burrito that didn't do it's name justice (Joey Bag of Donuts).        The tables and floor were filthy, the best suited table for our group was disgusting and even after trying to personally tend to it, we gave up since there was stale cheese crusted onto the top.  Quite a few tables deserved tending to, but there were only three girls working from what I could tell up front.  The beverage bar could have also used some maintenance as ice was overflowing at the bottom of the fountain and cup tops were all scattered.    For the record, the Men's restroom was clean within reason."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and service was so nice! I was with friends that didn't buy anything and he offered them free chips as well! I got the band camp vegetarian bowl. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Everything was fresh and tasty. Staff was polite and friendly. I  ordered a taco salad with shell. A bit small but taste very good. A great place to go for a quick craving of Tex Mex and you do not have a lot of time."}
{"text":"This Moe's is new, clean, and fast. The establishment is very nice and it's a great stop to grab a quick bite to eat. The food is good and your meal comes with free chips which is awesome!  It's basically a less expensive option to Chipotle, with more options, and not as fresh of ingredients. I can totally see where people would love this restaurant... to me its just an imitation of the King (Chipotle). Very close comparison to Qdoba."}
{"text":"Fairly popular as only food option. High prices and non. Description MX food.  They could do a lot better since they have a captive market. Limited seating and tight.  High prices for \"Mexican\" food which is greasy Taco Bell. Stay away at all costs."}
{"text":"I have always liked Moe's.  But unfortunately, this branch is so bad that I don't want to come back anymore.  Usually, the staff should greet incoming  customers...\"WELCOME TO MOE'S!!!!\"  Not this one!  Staff looks so tired or unhappy being there.  Everything in the line needed to be refilled.  No taco bowl, no steaks, no mushroom...etc! Usually they're  fast in making your order. But this one takes a whole month to make one frickin burrito!  Cashier doesn't know what he's  doing! Their trays are soooooooooo sticky as if they haven't been washed in a very long time.  They close 30 mins. before the scheduled hour.  If you come in 30 mins before  the closing time, the staff will tell you they are CLOSING and the bins are already halfway empty!!!!  I hope they change manager and staff........"}
{"text":"Welcome to Moe's! Sounded like Ferris Bueller's teacher. Listen, you don't want to say it, and I know I don't want to hear it. But that's the fresh hell that awaits when you enter. I immediately resent any place that makes me call anything by a cute name. It's a burrito not a homewrecker. So after waiting for the people in front of me, who must have just been released from a time capsule to order, they looked at every ingredient like it was some exotic organism, I ordered. The 16 yr old in front of me asked if I wanted mushrooms and I said no, I'd like onions and peppers. He just pushed my order to his right. You can't put Baby in a corner!! Young man, I know you're going to grow up and be an astrophysicist one day and this job is below you but I have a text from my wife with 17 ingredients that need to get in that burrito bowl and we need to get this right because you have a better chance of seeing God than seeing me back here again. Would you like two duffel bags of chips and a shot glass of queso? Sure, if it comes with it. After going to the salsa bar and getting my drinks I felt like I worked there. For everyone born after 1999, you can call any Mexican restaurant in Painesville and tell them what you want and it'll be ready for you when you get there.  Not only would I not recommend the lackluster food to anyone I consider it psychological torture and should be banned by the Geneva Convention. This location used to be a medical center where I received an MRI years ago. I laid in pain for 25 minutes perfectly still and it was far more enjoyable than going to Moe's."}
{"text":"Poor service, dirty tables, both trash cans were full, no ice and only 1/2 of a cup of sweet tea available. Not a pleasant experience for dinner."}
{"text":"After growing up in Buffalo, I have missed Moe's greatly. This however, was a very sad experience. It started with the attitudes of the two girls working there. Almost like we were inconveniencing them by trying to order what we wanted and how we wanted it. Only getting worse from there, when I brought to their attention that there was a hair in the sour cream, the attitude increased as if I was behind the counter and put it there. She straight up took the hair out and kept serving the sour cream. \"Complementary \" chips were also a hassel for these girls. Another customer asked about their soda machine being out of everything,  which is was, and the employee, keeping with her poor attitude, \"well I don't work at this store\". I guess I'll fulfill my cravings for Moe's when I'm back in Buffalo. This location is surely a lost cause."}
{"text":"Staff is always nice, food is always bomb. We've made it tradition to come every Mo'Monday"}
{"text":"Got to give this location 1 star for poor management. And 1 star to the corporate offices. So they advertise a $5.99 burrito on Mondays. Awesome. They let you go through the line and then scam you at the register if you order steak or tofu. It actually costs more than $5.99 for either of those items.  After looking at three signs. Pointing to them, and asking where it says that, the person at the register got the store manager. This dude then refused to give me the price. I gave him another chance to make good. He refused.  I paid the higher price with the decision to never return and tell as many people as I can about this scam. I work across the street in a corporate office of about 100 people. I don't know if anyone listened, but the catering of Moe's that we did around 8 times a year stopped. Awesome co-workers.  The corporate office is getting 1 star for making the signage. They are part of the scam.  Update: I heard this has been fixed and the signage now states that steak and tofu cost more. But so sad, too bad, I am never returning."}
{"text":"Very slow service tonight, ordered burritos, salsa, beans were Not drained before putting on the tortillas resulting in a soggy mess."}
{"text":"First time here..... heard good things about this place and was not impressed at all the food had some flavor.....i should've gone over to zabas why better flavor and better portions....i ordered the nachos it started out with portion of chips then the cheese sauce black beans to follow all good then came the steak one scoop hmmmmmm......then toppings like no other....there was more toppings than anything else....felt like ordered a veggie nachos...had to search for my steak..."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Moe's.   The service is always polite and prompt.  The ingredients always taste fresh and for the money you do get a generous amount of fillings.  In my opinion it's better than the other burrito chains in Pittsburgh.  Go for the burritos stay for the salsa bar."}
{"text":"The worst. Cold meat, disgusting bathroom. Random people walking in and out of kitchen. No uniforms. Very weird."}
{"text":"My office places individual orders for 5-10 people on weekdays for pick up during the lunch rush. Moe's has never had a problem getting all of our orders made for the same time, & made correctly. They often send us with extra chips & drink cups- much appreciated.   Also, the salsa bar is awesome. I don't mind that the cups for the salsa are fairly small - it cuts down on waste & makes it easier to take a small amount of each salsa to try.   They have the fancy coke machine with ALL the flavors - love that!   Overall never been disappointed. It IS fast food american-mexican food... Great prices, fast moving line & fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"I am of the opinion this place kicks Chipotle's ass.  Only thing I would change about this place is possibly turning the music down and maybe making a separate room for people who insist on bringing their screaming brats to a restaurant."}
{"text":"Showed up on a friday night 12/5/14.  This is my third time here.  The staff is still disorganized.  5 people working and only one is making the food on the line.  The food becomes cold by the time you check out because they are so friendly, but slow..  They ran out of chicken when it was my turn to order.  So I waited patiently.  They said they would bring my order out. They served me the wrong order.   and forget my side of guac.  The manager asked if I would like anything for my troubles, so I asked for another small guac and maybe some queso.  She never came back out to the table.  I finished my meal.  Tried to throw away my trash but they removed the trash can for emptying.  I think Zabbas in the same mall is run more efficiently and a better bet."}
{"text":"Ate at Moe's on Monday 2/12/18 at 6:54p.  Wasn't very crowded at this time, yet all of the open tables were dirty.   After checking out, we asked the cashier if she could have someone clean our table.   She said she'd send someone over.  After waiting 5 minutes, we cleaned the table ourselves by using napkins and water from the soda machine.  After we got settled, we went to the salsa bar and found it needing attention.  It was a mess and many of the salsas were empty.   I went back to my friend working the register and requested to speak with the manager.   The manager seemed overwhelmed and explained that they were understaffed with only 4 people working that day.   I noticed that the food prep area was also filthy with food scraps on the floor.  The manager said they were doing the best with what staff they had working.   There was no sense of urgency in meeting the customer's needs.  I completed the on line survey and expressed my concerns.  Gave my email to be contacted about my visit.  Have not heard back from anyone.   On a lighter note, I ordered my favorite meal joey bag of donuts.   It was very good minus the salsa that wasn't available due to them being understaffed."}
{"text":"Love this place the food is always fresh and the staff is super friendly I also love the free chips and their cheso is awesome I try to stat away but keep coming back it's so good"}
{"text":"I stopped in here once while passing through the neighbourhood. As fast food goes, this as good as it's going to get. I got the bowl, which kept my tie clean :)  I wouldn't go so far as to say it is authentic, but it's leaps and bounds ahead of Taco Bell or your garden variety fajitas from a sit-in chain. If you're looking for quick mexi-styled eats, you may really like Moe's. I did!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time coming to THIS Moe's! They've actually turned me off to the point I probably won't go to ANY Moe's ever again! Despite a prior bad experience at this same location, I returned because I like the food & it's Moe's Monday. My frustration today stems from ordering the Earmuffs with steak, which comes with guacamole. Since I don't like guacamole l, I asked if I could sub queso and was told no. But could add it for $1.09 (Not sure why since a side of both is the same price) So, I got the guacamole on the side and will just throw it away. This is my last visit to any Moe's. Maybe I'll try one of their competitors & see if I get better service."}
{"text":"Note: I forgot to take down their hours, but I do know that they were open until 9 P.M. And we barely got in under the wire last night.   Kay's being more supportive than skeptical or cynical about my Yelp activities (fixation?) of late and suggested we hit Moe's on the way back to her abode since it remained unreviewed.   I know. She's comin' around.   I really knew nothing about this chain, assuming that it was akin to Chi Chi's.  Nah. Think Subway meets TGI Fridays meets Taco Bell. Yeah.  No, no, no, no, no. C'mon. Don't walk away from me. Please.  We walk in and a chipper, supra-motivated 20-something bellows to us \"WELCOME TO MOOOOOE'S\" in life-is-good, kick-ass fashion. He then proceeded to explain the menu to us (Kay's had been here before, I hadn't) as a slew of fixing lay in front of him behind glass. Portraits of ordinary people who resemble deceased, famed musicians hang on the walls. That's there the TGI influence comes into play.   I tell the kid I want a beef burrito with everything since that's the way I like to rock and roll.   \"OH, you want a Homewrecker,\" he tells me with an excited grin on his face, rubbing his palms together as if he's gonna build a fire via pure friction.   And everything was what I got, masterfully wrapped up in a beach towel of a flour tortilla. Bacon, olives, guac, onion, cucumber.  Yes, cucumber, artfully cut I might add. Yeah, verrry Subway.   I cannot emphasize enough how adeptly engineered this burrito was. Nothing burst out from the ends of it. Everything stayed inside this burrito despite it being stuffed with ground beef, rice, and uncounted other garnishes. I mean, this was as cornucopian as Thommy Friedman sans the wide-eyed glee over globalization and fatuous metaphors and analogies. I mean, if Friedman's ideas had as much meat as a Homewrecker Burrito from Moe's (not to mention an air of peace and justice) I might climb aboard his intellectual bus.   As advertised, we got free chips and fresh salsa in various flavors (can't recall the names) of red and green with our respective meal (Kay got a fish taco with a cinematic hoot of a name). I covered my chips in X-Mas time style and found both soupy, somewhat chunky salsas to be a cut above canned, Moe's purporting to make their own, the author being inclined to believe it.  Oh get this, Moe's also claims to offer sustainable fast-food...   http://moes.com/mission  They have tofu??? Equally impressive and refreshing is their aversion to microwaves and freezers. The Fresh Food Revolt is spreading.  I'll knock off a star for their cookies (again, how Subway) which tasted like the kind you'd find at a supermarket bakery (geez, score one for Subway for having better cookies).   But I'll return one (I won't give them more than 4 stars) for Moe's enthusiastic service and fun, hip, relaxed, upscale cafeteria atmosphere/concept."}
{"text":"Had lunch yesterday afternoon...service was slow and our food ended up cold because of it.  Place was filthy! I could barely eat much of our lunch.  Salsa and drink area was a mess, very unappetizing. Will not go back. Seemed like there was no management on staff and the employees running the place didn't much care about customer service."}
{"text":"Wow. I have been to a few different Moe's, where you're usually greeted with a \"welcome to Moe's\" and friendly staff take your order. Not here, this location is the alterna-Moe's. The staff is super unfriendly, 90% of the tables were dirty and there positive \"Moe's vibe\" is seriously lacking.   Honestly, the food is good. It's the Moe's standard you'd expect, with the exception of the chips. Maybe this was a fluke day, but mine were definitely on the stale side. Thank goodness they were sparse with the chips today. But the chicken was tasty, well cooked and the salsas were fresh.   The downfall truly was the ordering process. Everything was slopped down in my bowl with the same enthuasium as a disgruntled elementary cafeteria lady.   I will say, on the bright side, the cashier was friendly. I believe his name was Lyron."}
{"text":"We ordered Moe's taco bar for a birthday party this past weekend. The food arrived on time and everything was delicious. It was so convenient that everything was taken care of for us and our guests loved it! A taco bar allowed people to customize their meal to their liking and was able to accommodate the vegetarians in the crowd. It was such a fun change from the typical pizza party and not much more money either. It gave me the opportunity to visit with guests instead of being stuck in the kitchen the entire time."}
{"text":"I started going to Moe's for lunch when I worked across the street.  For fast food Mexican, it's pretty darn good.  I only gave it four stars for the fairly limited selection.  I've only had the burritos and my favorites are the Homewrecker and the Triple Lindy.  You've gotta love how they name their food.  The food is a lot fresher than what you might find at Del Taco or Taco Bell, and it comes out a lot faster.  Another plus is that they serve beer and margaritas.  This is a great spot for an inexpensive yet healthy Mexican meal."}
{"text":"Have been to this Moe's a few times.  It is the usual friendly Welcome to Moe's reception.  The line usually moves relatively fast.  Food is the standard Moe's.  Pretty good Queso, chips, burritos.  Have learned that I am not a big fan of Moe's carnitas, the seasoning seems to be a little off to me, so I order one of the other options.  There is usually one person cleaning tables and helping out in the seating area, which is good so it is kept relatively clean."}
{"text":"There is no better spot to grab a quick veggie bowl for lunch than MOE'S!  These guys work hard, especially at lunch time.  They are fast, quick, and make it convenient to grab something when in a hurry.  I have been trying to eat more vegetarian/vegan lately and I love how they have many veggie options to choose from."}
{"text":"Great place as far as fast food is! I've been here several times, there is never a wait, the service is excellent and we are always greeted the second we walk through the door. The food was hot and our bellies are full! I put the fresh cilantro on my quesadilla and it hit the spot! My picky son was even able to build a taco to his liking. I'll be adding this to the list of places to visit!"}
{"text":"We eat here about once a week. I had ONE bad experience here - a general manager who is not usually there was barely listening to me. He made my order wrong and it was much smaller than they usually make it. Other than that, the employees are friendly, it is always clean, and we love the food."}
{"text":"Oh no, Moe's. Just no. I had higher hopes having never tried you before. First the good: the kids liked their kids meals and the price was reasonable ($3.50 each).  I thought the chicken in my quesadilla was good. Also like the freestyle coke machine (but was out of my favorite lime).  The bad: for $30 got subpar version of Chipotle for more money. Kept getting weird whiffs of cleaning solution. Salsas were bland to me. Server put a super dollop of sour cream on which made the thing a super mess. Guac pretty pedestrian. Music inside was not fitting to the theme."}
{"text":"Horrible service for a place that's less busy than a mausoleum. The employees aren't trained properly and don't seem to understand their own system, promos, or menu.   Food that seems to have sat out all day and tastes stale, or at best, flavorless. This place is not fresh and you can tell food hardly moves/changes like at a Chipotle, etc. I wish I could have gotten a refund or just walked out. I should have known this place was bad when they're running a 5.99 Burrito promotion and it's the lunch rush and the place is empty. My salsa had hair in it, not just a single hair but several. I'm surprised this place is still in business. You're better off going else where.  I don't know if this is indicative of the chain or just this location, but stay away and beware of this location. I wouldn't eat here if they paid me to it was that bad.  When there are other options like Chipotle, Qdoba, Baja fresh, zabas, etc. just around the corner /nearby, you're better off going elsewhere.    P.S.  No employee carries a name tag and they sign in as cashier on the receipt. Impossible to hold anybody accountable.  Again,  poor management,  food quality, service etc."}
{"text":"How about hitting those nachos with some steak and queso.  I expected some cheese steak filled goodness...instead I felt like I was on a scavenger hunt to find the proteins. It was fresh and tasty for what it was...just not worth 11 bucks including a small drink."}
{"text":"I literally just waited in a 2 person line for 15 minutes. It sucks when you leave a restaurant hungry because service was nonexistent. I counted 5 employees. 1 was chatting up a table, 2 went to find whole wheat tortillas and one told the other one to come help the person in front of me."}
{"text":"I love Moe's! My daughters and I are vegetarians, so I can't speak for the meat, but I love the rest of the ingredients they offer. I've been there three times since this location opened. I'm kind of disappointed that the employees don't yell \"Welcome to Moe's!\" really loud when customers walk in, but after asking them about it today, I was told that people were complaining it was too loud, so they stopped yelling. Too bad really, because it was fun. I hope to see the Moe's locations here packed soon, like they are in Florida. It's really a good time. I'm so glad Moe's finally made it to Vegas. For a quick stop lunch, it's perfect for me. :)  Edit on 3-18. I took this location down a star. We went here again yesterday. The rice was not cooked at all. It was very off putting. I also ordered chips and queso. We got home and had chips, but there was no queso. That was the item I was looking forward to (especially after hard rice). I still love the food, but I think the staff needs to retrained. How can you serve uncooked rice in a business that puts rice in 50% of the dishes? Very disappointed."}
{"text":"After several visits, these folks have in our view out-Chipotled Chipotle. The key for us is the less-chewy proteins comparatively. If one buys the corporate posturing ......same cage-free, organic, free-range, kinda sourcing as the other guys, very tasty end products, and they give you free chips and salsa like every other non-Chipotle Mexican restaurant on the continent. Kudos Moe you \" done good!\""}
{"text":"Mehhhh this is like one and a half stars. I thought I missed Moe's from living on the east coast but I don't. I'm definitely a chipotle girl. This location was empty as anything and the produce that they put on my burrito bowl (earmuffs) looked old and wilted. Very bland, all salsas tasted the same and were super watery. Decent service though"}
{"text":"I agree with others, I like Moe's this location not all that. We got a to go order and they managed to give us the wrong burrito. Busy and staff not super friendly. The welcome to Moe's very forced if it even occurs."}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm walking through the airport with my husband after a great weekend and see Moe's Southwestern- so we go on over and order nachos with the works! $12 later we go to find a seat in the crowded terminal and what do I do but trip and watch as the untouched nachos fly through the air and land face down lid off on the ground (keep in mind I was totally sober). Then with a red face I began scooping nachos and cheese off the ground. Some nice guy with brochures came over and sacrificed some paper to help me scoop my nachos and then an allegiant employee came and helped too! So any-who, I walked back over to moes where they replaced my nachos for free and didn't scoff at me- the nachos were perfect for two people and tasted great!"}
{"text":"Been here about a half dozen times.  Twice I've had to talk to the manager about being overcharged.  Both times the cashiers were budding beurocrats who couldn't admit to a mistake.  Both times the manager was good and admitted they needed to communicate better down the line and tried to make things right.  I feel for them.  They are always hiring so I think turnover really hurts.  The bathroom was out of paper towels.  The parking is cramped.  I tend to come at peak times.  On the up side the food here has always been good, the dining area clean and I always run into a friend or two."}
{"text":"If this were my first experience with a Moes, I'd have been pretty unimpressed. We actually went through security twice though because we don't have regular access to Moes, but thought we would get there since we could. We stood there for at least 2-3 minutes before they acknowledged us, we were the only ones in line. The guy that took our order had no idea what a Billy Barou was... odd, since its been on their menu forever as far as we know, including the menu right there in front of him. While he was making my homewrecker, I guess he hadn't quite mastered the moes technique for getting guacamole and sour cream into a burrito and I ended up with one huge glob of sour cream and one glob of guacamole and hte rest of the burrito had none. He didn't really seem to know what he was doing and none of the other employees seemed like they were trying to help.  The ingrediants were definitely not up to what I think Moes standards would be. The rice was dry, the steak seemed like it had been under a heat lamp, and the chips were not that good. In addition, the the lack of the salsa bar that I'm used to at Moes was a bit of a bummer."}
{"text":"Go to chipotle better tasting food.the Food at Moe's tasted gross and the restaurant was god awful dirty."}
{"text":"This is absolutely one of the best places that my family loves to go to! Every weekend we visit here at least once and it's always great service and great food.  Is this Chipotle? No. There is a difference in that Moe's will season their beef and chicken with simple seasons (salt and pepper) and leave the flavors of the other ingredients to do the work. The other main difference is that the burritos are slightly bigger at Chipotle.  Is this Qdoba? No. Since Chipotle and Qdoba were formed 2 years apart from each other in Denver, CO (Chipotle coming first) they are nearly identical. Moe's is different from them both due to the seasoning and allowing the ingredients to come together. Moe's also gives free chips and has a salsa bar that you can get different flavors from.  We like going to Moe's because we are treated well and have always had great food. The execution of the burrito is one of the important factors and I prefer to have a place that will allow the fresh ingredients do the work rather than a marinade. Another reason we choose Moe's time after time is that they donate a lot of their proceeds to charity's that are important to us. Example would be JDRF (Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation) which is something the other places just don't do."}
{"text":"After seeing an episode of Undercover Boss years ago, I've always wondered if Moe's lived up to the standards the company appeared to hold itself at during the airing of the show. I must say that my family & I were disappointed with the lack of variety  cleanliness.  If you pay close attention to the menu, everything is a copy of a copy the only difference between each item is one ingredient (two at the best) but surly not enough to consider it worth a dollar or more extra. The cheese dip was bland and lacking in flavor. I was also disappointed as the only drink options were water or pop...nothing decaffeinated.    But the overall cleanliness of Moe's was concerning. All the tables needed to be wiped down, the floor swept and the fabric on the chairs had food smashed into them & are badly stained. My family said their food was okay...this was our first & last visit."}
{"text":"It was everything I expected it to be.  It was very clean and that is a bonus. There was no out of control mess at the salsa bar and all tables had been wiped down.  The chips were a little too salty and the machine was out of ice.  It's a nice place for lunch!"}
{"text":"I go here quite often for lunch to get out of the office.  As there are not many Mexican/Tex-Mex options near my work, this is my usual go-to (unless I order Chipotle ahead of time).  The employees are very friendly & quick with moving the line.   My usual order is two Funkmeister tacos - I fill up on veggies with my choice of meat (with no side of queso/guac or a drink, it comes to $5.67).  The portions are pretty consistent.  The free chips & salsa are a plus & their salsas (especially the salsa verde, which is a permanent item) are quite good.  One day I hope to figure out the recipes for them so I can make them at home.  To keep things interesting, they have a limited time item in addition to two seasonal salsas.  For example, this summer they had the Ancho Lime Bowl, which was what I got if I was sick of getting two tacos.  The two seasonal salsas (for now) are Cucumber Mojito & Light My Fire.  These'll probably change in the near future.   You get a decent amount for your money; however, the food is a bit bland, like others have said.  I'm into spice & heat.  Moe's will not provide that, BUT they will provide you with a quick meal for not a lot of cash.  P.S.  The woman who cleans the salsa bar busts her butt to make sure it's clean, especially during lunch.  She's also quick with refilling the salsa if you let her know that one is running low."}
{"text":"I've already not been a fan of Moe's for awhile. Call it overkill from eating it throughout college or what but I usually whine a bit when this is where my parents want to go to eat with me. I usually find everything bland. But I had a gift card soooo today was the day to use it.  I opted for something I don't normally get since I have been displeased with my previous pickings...a quesadilla. More specifically one with steak (grass fed here which is a nice touch), pintos, mushrooms, grilled onions & peppers, cilantro and jalapeños. Then we also scored ourselves a cup of chili con queso, a limited time item. The quesadilla was just alright, the steak was surprisingly flavorful this time but the mushrooms had a very strange flavor to them..no bueno. The guy assumed I meant pickled jalapeños when I requested \"jalapeños\" , but I meant the fresh ones so I ended up picking the pickled ones off. The chili con carne was really good though. They should consider making this a regular item, way more interesting than the regular ol' queso. Dipping the quesadilla in it was not the worst idea either.  It was pretty empty when we went in, an odd middle of lunch and dinner time and the 2 people working there were very friendly and helpful. They did have great tunes playing the whole time as well. It wasn't as terrible as I remember but still not enough to make me crave anything from Moe's or go back, unless I have another gift card."}
{"text":"Only 2 workers, food was cold. Paid for queso that was clumpy. All the tables were dirty I had to wipe it off myself. Trash cans we're over flowing. The salsas were all empty. Just bad experience the workers seemed nice just lazy"}
{"text":"I do like the whole \"Welcome to Moe's\" thing said loudly whenever you walk into one of their restaurant locations. It is a nice differentiating aspect of the place. Though I do think Coldstone or is it Marble Slab provides a similar loud greeting upon entering one of their stores too.  Hey, hit both places and feel important for the rest of the day!   Atmosphere - Narrow, dark, friendly.   Food - I had a burrito bowl.  I am not sure what the official name is for this dish here but I know for sure it's not 'Joey Bag of Bowls'.  The dish is basically a burrito w/out a shell.  The one I had this day was okay but not spectacular like say Qdoba...but all right. To me, Moe's is not as fresh tasting as the Q or even Chipotle for that matter...but it fits the bill.   Service - From the greeting received when you arrive to the interaction during the ordering process, Moe's always feels friendly.   Price - A burrito bowl and drink comes in at just above $8. Not too bad for a filling lunch. Don't forget the drink refills are free.   Overall - Moe's does the job of satisfying you when you are looking for a decent burrito and friendly service."}
{"text":"Giving three stars solely because of the men's restroom. I have been in bars that didn't reek of smoke this badly. It smelled like someones's trailer park grandma had been hotboxing it since 1987.   Food was good per the Moe's standard. Employees were nice and personable. But damn, that men's room."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! The staff was very friendly. One of our burritos was massive and didn't look like it would close but one of the girls was amazing and made it close!  They use great ingredients and make sure they aren't all piled in one area but spread out. The meat they use is a fanatic quality and so are their salsas.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"This Moe's location is one of my faves...  Sometimes, I take the boyfriend lunch on my off days and this place is really helpful... I have placed numerous call in orders and the food is always hot and correctly prepared... The queso is expensive, in my opinion, but it's also really good... I guess you kind of have to suck it up at that point... I won't buy it if we're eating a home, but for lunch at my honey's workplace, I shell out for it...  On the occasion that I do a regular walk in visit, I get the classic greeting (Welcome to Moe's!) and swiftly executed service... Even if there's a long line, you really won't be waiting long...  The only gripe I have is the parking lot... It's so small and the spaces are alternately diagonal on each line... If there's a rush, it's a headache waiting to happen to get in and/or out..."}
{"text":"A American Mexican fast food chain. No real authentic Mexican food just toppings in a bowl or burrito. But still tasty. The food is fresh and easy to order. Just look point and they add it to your order. The staff is nice and make sure the food is presented well. The restaurant itself is always clean. I've never had any issues. For what moes represents its good and I'll eat here again for sure"}
{"text":"My first time ever at a Moe's. It really was nothing special, it's like the Subway of burrito places.    I got The Homewrecker with Chicken, it was okay, but so heavy on my stomach. We also got some chips and queso to try, I hear people love their queso. Well the chips were crisp but tasted of old oil ( this place just opened) and I didn't like the queso, it tasted like the Tostitos dip you buy in the supermarket. The staff was friendly and helpful and the restaurant was clean. Luckily we got our food free from a  facebook promotion. If I do go back, I'll probably try a salad. But as of now, I have no plans on returning, it's just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Its ok if you can't get to anywhere else and want to eat burritos, nachos etc. The nachos were a bit soggy, but otherwise it was so-so. Slow service at the counter."}
{"text":"Stopped into Moes for the first time today for lunch and got a steak bowl.  They are WAY more generous with portions of proteins than Chipotle.  The options are also more varied...mushrooms, onions, peppers, cilantro.... than their neighbor.  It feels like Chipotle has been my fling but Moes and I could go steady but for the 'welcome to moes' thing every time someone walks in the door."}
{"text":"Didn't feel like eating Burger King so settled on Moe's. I got the burrito which was a substantial amount of food, but $10 is a bit pricey for a burrito. But I guess that's to be expected cause your @ the mercy of Airport pricing once your behind the boarding gate.  I got everything on the burrito so I'm not sure if one of the fillings made it salty. Overall it was \"aight\" definitely not the best burrito I've ever tasted, & I'm sure you could do far worse."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst food I've ever eaten.  The steak tasted like garbage. I will NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"When I heard that Moe's had opened shop in the EpiCentre I had to give it a try.  I am a big fan of Moe's.  There are plenty of what I call the \"Big Giant Burrito\" places, but here is why I think Moe's stands out above those others.  They give you free chips and salsa with your BGB.  They have 5 kinds of salsa including a tasty tomatillo salsa which is my favorite.  Less than a week old this Moe's was running fairly smoothly.  The line for food was 3/4's of the way to the door, but it moved quickly.  The staff assembling the BGB's did a good job of moving the line along.    Here is the one bad thing about this location.  The cash registers, salsa bar, drink machine, lid & straw station, etc, were jammed into a corner that has a support column right in the middle of it.  The 100 flavor coke machine didn't seem to be holding things up too much, but salsa bar, lids & straw station did cause a bit of a traffic jam. I was able to get my food, drink, & salsa, find a seat, eat and get out in about 40 minutes.    So even though it was busy it wasn't too bad to get in, eat and get out.  Moe's is great and the layout works well except for the corner of delay."}
{"text":"Moe's is way better than Chipotle or Qdoba.  Moe's offers free chips & salsa with their burritos.  You have to pay extra for this at other places.  They have 5 salsa's available including a tomatillo salsa which I have never seen at any other place.  Their burritos are the same size as any other giant burrito place and the price is comparable.  They also have daily specials.  My favorite. Moe Monday - - Any burrito, chips and a regular drink for $5.55.  Can you get that a Chipotle or Qdoba?  No, I don't think so.  Save money, eat at Moe's."}
{"text":"If only Moes was this close when i was in school.. at least when I attend football games and visit friends I can count on stopping here and fueling up. I haven't had a bad experience yet with this store and I understand some places just starting can have issues with getting the ball rolling. I've been probably 4+ times now and am still satisfied.   What prompted me to leave this review was the service I had during my last visit. Mike, whom I believe to be some type of manager/higher up, was extremely helpful and super nice. They had what seemed to be some new hires learning the ropes. I couldn't really tell because I got through the line with my friends in tow without any trouble. He thanked us for our patience but that was still faster then McDonald's sometimes!!   You should know what Moes is about by now so I'm not going to describe the food. It's good every time I go. WELCOME TO MOES!"}
{"text":"Their chicken ALWAYS tastes dry.  The staff is not friendly, and the last time I went in there, the person taking orders and adding toppings did not speak english.....wow.  Although I live within a 2 minute drive, I go to the Salsarita's in Cotswold.  They have better chips, fresher ingredients, larger burritos, better salsa...and their chicken isn't dry!!!"}
{"text":"Very good fast Southwest food nice variety, and nice prices. They have a salsa bar with different salsas and you get chips with every order . I always order the home wrecker Burrito. Great place for a fast bite to eat and quick service, and friendly staff. Must I mention you download app on your Birthday you get a free Burrito ! Nice decor inside and they have a patio weather permitting."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few Moes locations - downtown Charlotte, Huntersville, and the now closed Ayrsley location and this one is just as good as the rest. My only issue with it is how small the location is vs, how many people come in. It can feel rather stuffy in there, BUT the food is amazing.  If you are reading this and you want to eat my order that I always get (and I've never been disappointed in it), order the following::::  Chicken burrito No beans Yes to the rice Queso on top (I know it costs more) A little bit of pico de gallo (too much::: too spicy) Cilantro Tomato  Cucumber    And that's it... Sometimes I'll get guac on the side, but yeah..it's good. Oh and I love squeezing lemon on top of my chips... Try it, sooooo good."}
{"text":"Food is alright. Service is not that great. They were a mess."}
{"text":"I was very excited to have Moe's join the vast choices of restaurants in Mentor, as I used to eat there almost everyday at the one in Avon. I was sadly let down. I agree with the other reviews that the meat is very under seasoned. I had a Chicken Salad - and the dressing was probably the best part of it. I'm guessing because it had flavor. The line was very long - due to just opening. However, we arrived around 5pm. The Salsa bar was looking pretty sad and need of refilling then. The entire time we were there, no one gave it any love! Not one employee bothered to look at it - not even the manager(?) who was chatting with some folks for about 20 minutes - right next to it. The cranberry salsa was good, what I could try of it. I do appreciate the freestyle coke machine - as I am a caffiene free soda drinker & I hate Sprite - it's nice to have options! I will probably give it another try, maybe when they aren't so busy."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I'm a huge fan of Moe's and I am pumped that there are more popping up in the Cleveland area. Considering this is a fairly new establishment, they're doing a decent job. My only complaint is that on multiple occasions I've asked for a side of sour cream with my quesadilla and they've forgotten. The restaurant is still trying to attract business and they're very friendly and generous with portions. The place is really clean and fresh looking. Also, if you're trying to avoid a long Chipotle-like line, you can go here to get food quicker. I think the place will only get better with time."}
{"text":"Conveniently located and really fresh food.  Just a quick walk from the new Hilton Garden Inn.  The staff was friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  delicious, fresh food... I'm in!  Brand new, so this is BUSY! Hungry crowd  starts  about 11:20-11:30 a.m. By noon, the line's out the door. It's  a small, cozy-bright spot, with high-energy , friendly  people.  I love quesadillas and also chicken, so the chicken club quesadilla was a no brainer. It's  chicken, bacon, lettuce,  and tomatoes, with a zippy chipotle ranch dressing.  Fresh, delicious, and filling. The brownie looked tempting, but I'm a small eater and I don't usually order dessert when I'm out,  so I passed. This time. They also have cookies, ice tea, and Coke drinks.  I  wish they had outdoor seating, and this were a bigger space, but this is just a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"I don't eat out often, as I am admittedly picky about my food's quality, freshness, and the cleanliness of the restaurant. I can vouch for this Moe's as always clean with friendly people...greeting each customer with a loud, \"Welcome to Moe's\" when I enter. The food is also fresh...often made that day. You have a good variety of what I call a Tex-Mex foods...taco salads, burritos that are too large for me to eat in one sitting, and you can have it 'made to order' your way. You get chips with your meal and their salsa are good, no matter which one you choose. Monday they have some kind of 'special' and are packed so I usually don't go then as I am only feeding myself. They also do catering and one clinic I worked in used to have More catered frequently. The hot foods came hot and cold foods cold, all prepared in closed containers."}
{"text":"Easy in and out or grab and go type place. Fresh quality ingredients. Basic Southwest food selections. Personal favorite is chicken salad in shell with honey sirachha salsa instead of dressing. LOVE the honey sirachha salsa!"}
{"text":"All moes are pretty poor in quality overall, but you at least know what you're getting.   This particular location is the worst of the bunch, though. The employees have been careless the few times I attempted to eat here. Once they completely fumbled a burrito into pieces and still tries to serve it and the next time an employee rolled her eyes when I asked her to change gloves since I have an allergy. Haven't been to a moes since then."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I ever experienced. Cashier cussed out another employee while ringing me up because she wanted to take her break. Food is delicious overall. Wish the place had a little more space."}
{"text":"For me, Moe's is the Chipotle killer. I have been a Chipotle lover for years until I discovered the joy that is Moe's, and here's why.  First of all, Moe's has more selection in toppings for your burrito or the bowl.  Second, chips and salsa is free. And I don't mean you get one little cup. They have a salsa bar and you can get all you want. And it's all for the same (or very close to the same) price you would pay for a burrito or bowl at chipotle.  If there is a Moe's near by I don't see a reason to ever go to chipotle anymore. Don't get me wrong, Chipotle isn't bad, its just that at Moe's you get more for the money, and taste better too. The one advantage Chipotle has is that they are open an hour later until 10pm. Moe's shuts it down at 9pm.  Go to Moe's! If you have never been you NEED to try it out, it might change your bowl/burrito eating life!"}
{"text":"Get it together boys and girls.  I felt like I was in a senior hangout spot with all of the staff just hanging out chatting.   I came to eat not interrupt your socializing.  Nonetheless, I asked for a Fat Sam and multiple employees acted like they had seen a ghost.  Thy made me feel like it wasn't really an item they have ever sold.  I had to Google Fat Sam and show them that it was indeed an option for Moes and the only thing I ever eat there.  They then tried to tell me that they are new so they don't teach the new employees any of the older menu options.  That's no excuse!  If I can tell you how to make it, with the ingredients readily available, just make it and keep a customer happy.  Oh, they asked me how many shells come with it and when I said two, they said they would have to charge me extra for the additional shell.  For real?!  It is standard two shell, not extra.    Come on Moes, teach your employees how to learn from their seasoned patron and not ridicule them over something they have never had the opportunity to create.  Chipotle will take your place in the market if you cannot figure out better employee-customer relations.    I left unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my niece.  It's fresh fast food.  I thought the prices were reasonable.  The portions were a good size.  They give you free chips and they have a free salsa bar.    My niece likes the soda machine. You can pick between a lot of different flavors.   I have to admit I enjoyed it as much as the kids.  Who doesn't want to mix cherry coke with lemonade and orange soda???  I had a vegetarian taco. It had beans, tomato, lettuce, rice and guac and sour cream. It was good. Like I mentioned, everything tasted fresh. The guacamole was homemade.    It's worth checking out if you're in a hurry and are looking for something other than a burger."}
{"text":"WELCOME TO MOES! My kids, wife, and I love Moes, or as my son would say, \"let's go to welcome to Moe's.\" My kids love the powerwagon meal.  I get the homewrecker.  They give you ample chips and have a variety of different salsas to select from.  This Moes is clean with a friendly and attentive staff.  Im a fan."}
{"text":"I like the salsa bar and thought the salad with grilled chicken (all white meat!) was yummy. Everything tasted fresh. They give you lots of chips, which is great. The guacamole is not the best, but it wasn't bad.   You can also place your order online and customize as much as you want then have it ready to pick up, so that saves time and is convenient. I definitely recommend for a quick lunch or dinner - more variety in menu options than Chipotle."}
{"text":"What a surprise. Our favorite place. Or our kids favorite place took a nose dive. Long hair good preparers with no hair nets.  Every table was dirty and not cleaned. It was 7pm on a Tuesday. 5-6 people working. Not too busy. No salsa. Soda machine filthy. I wanted to cancel my order but the kids were so psyched to go. Last time. Too bad. It used to be so much better. And the whole time we ate - not one \"Welcome to Moe's \"!!!!  C'mon."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time eating at a Moe's & I have to say I'm very disappointed! People kept telling me how good they were.. Maybe I should have just stuck with the queso! When I walked in I was greeted then the guy took my order. He did not seem very friendly; he seemed irritate. He just put chicken on my tacos without asking me what type of chicken. I had to ask what the meat was. He checked me out in a hurry & just left my bag sitting on the counter. None of the ingredients looked fresh & I thought the price was a little high for tacos especially when not receiving a reasonable amount of meat & toppings. Lastly, the food was bland. I would not recommend eating here... They are nothing like chipotle!!"}
{"text":"I had basically given up on finding a decent burrito since I left CA.  I don't know why it's apparently impossible to take a tortilla, add stuff, and have the outcome be anything other than delightful but that has been my dilemma.   Then I discovered Moe's.  At first I wasn't expecting much.  It's a chain, the food is all tv show and movie references, and the staff shouts \"welcome to moe's\" when you walk in.   ...what's this?  Tofu that is actually seasoned and not a soggy gross mess?  CHIPS THAT AREN'T A SALT LICK??!  Fresh made salsas??  Then came the first bite.  ...and then Moe's became my food staple and got me through nursing school.    Being an obnoxious vegan with a broken ass GI system usually results in colon death after most \"burrito\" attempts in PA.  Not with Moe's.   The staff is super friendly, the food is ALWAYS good, and your colon won't try to escape your body.  Triple win."}
{"text":"It's only getting one star because you must give it at least one. Very simply, I ordered 2 chicken taco's they failed to put ANY chicken on either of them them. $8.00 for 2 tacos NO sides and NO chicken.They went right in the garbage.  Save some money, even Taco Bell is better.  The service was horrible, the girl working the evening of 03/0716, has NO knowledge of the menu, apparently she has no training. I will NEVER go there again and you shouldn't waste your money at this place either. There are plenty of other places in Downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  My go to lunch through out the work week.  Love the convenience of ordering online and picking up.  However, if you want to stay and sit its a very clean environment with huge mounted tv's.  The service is fast and professional no matter what time of day."}
{"text":"Moe's as a chain is relatively decent. This is the small airport variety that's never as good as the full scale model."}
{"text":"Came in here to grab some lunch while doing some shopping in the area.   Queso is my favorite but it was missing something today.  Got my normal steak buritto and ended up only eating maybe 1/2 of it beucase the steak was was to chewy and lacked its normal flavor. I'm hoping it was just my taste buds were off, I'll be back to check it out again."}
{"text":"After a long day at work, and nothing at home to fix, pickup was my plan. I have driven by Moe's for over 9 years and only been once more than 5 years ago. The parking lot is always full, Mexican sounds good, so my car led me to Moe's. I was greeted as I walked in by an enthusiastic staff. After looking over the menu I decided to go with two tacos. I ordered one chicken soft taco and one ground beef taco in a hard shell. I chose my fixings, added chips and queso and headed home. The ground beef was very flavorful, however not something you should take to go. The side the ground beef was on made the hard shell completely soft and I was unable to pick it up. No big deal because it was the best thing I ate. As for the chicken, very dry! And, the chips were fresh, but cold and no seasoning or salt. As for the queso, I wouldn't waste my money, nothing but melted cheese. I like a little kick, seasoning, jalepenos, etc. Overall the staff was friendly and the meal okay. Not my favorite Mexican fast food, but I would return and dine in next time."}
{"text":"I had high hopes after reading reviews and seeing the menu. I'm a fan of a burrito restaurant and like that you can build your own.  The problem being that the rice inside our burritos was basically raw, totally crunchy, so it really ruined the whole burrito. When we ordered, there was a girl training the order taker and she was very short and rude and made him hustle through the lunch rush. A line through the restaurant and she just stood there being ugly.  The queso here is pretty great though! We will probably give it one more try and hope they have it together."}
{"text":"Easily the best Moe's in town. Top notch customer service. Didn't catch their name but the employees their make it more than just a trip for fast food."}
{"text":"I ordered the ground beef nachos with queso. They were really good and spicy and my friend also mentioned how there was adequate toppings and the chips stay crispy.  Got guac on ths side but totally not necessary. I could barely finish  it.  Mens bathroom apparently was a nightmare(took away a star)  vomit in sink,urine and feces on floor  :/  womens bathroom was fine.  FYI Get a free meal on your birthday if you sign up for their emails"}
{"text":"Lots of bad here.   Ordered four tacos to go. Short drive home but they were soggy eat-with-a-fork failures by the time we ate them. One problem is the tacos were wrapped in foil. Good way to turn a hard shell into mush. Would paper be too much trouble? Or Moe's could choose not to allow hard taco take outs because the food quality suffers along with the reputation of the business.  Moe's filled the sack my tacos were in with tortilla chips. No salsa in the sack and, more importantly, none was offered. I would have happily paid for something to dip the chips in. The chips went in the trash.  Most disappointing was the staff. The person who prepared my order seemed more interested in the personal conversation he was having with a coworker than he was in my order. Then the cashier, who was out of the room for several minutes, left me with the impression she was doing me a favor by taking my money. No eye contact. No thank you. No \"sorry you had to wait\", just an attitude."}
{"text":"Came here years ago and the food was amazing.  No so much now.  Food had no flavor the salsa even was sad.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Worst - burrito - ever!!  Seriously the worst.  Dry, cold, salty chicken, non-melted cheese, flavorless pico.  I ended up eating just the side of black beans (from a can) and the chips and guac.  If I could give zero stars I would.   You are better off anywhere else, even on the plane!"}
{"text":"After all the times I defended this place against the extreme Chipotle fanatics, Moe's went and did me dirty once again. Sure, it has its perks like free chips and salsa, but I've been let down more than once by this particular location. As we entered, we were greeted with the most unenthusiastic \"Welcome to Moe's\". Inside, the restaurant was a mess. Every single table was dirty and there was trash and food spilled all over the floor. Their workstation looked especially disgusting with all the old, dry ingredients and the condiments spilling into each other. If this is how it looks when the restaurant is empty, I can't imagine how bad it must be during busy hours. To top it off, the girl making our burritos was the worst. Completely rude and didn't even ask what type of rice we wanted. I think I'm taking a break from Moe's for a while. If you need me, I'll be next door at Chipotle."}
{"text":"Horrendous customer service. I like Moe's but not this one. The guy preparing my food looked like I showed up at his house at 3am and demanded him to make me food. Even the girl at the counter didn't say a word. These people suck...at their job."}
{"text":"With the staff shouting \"Welcome to Moe's\" every time a new customer walked in today, I enjoyed a quick meal with two coworkers. Since the Moe's crew assembles it right in front of you, it has a feeling of being \"fresh\" and \"healthy\" though it's really easy to go heavy on the fattening ingredients if you're not careful.  That's not to say that it's not healthy. Not at all! If you go with the \"streaker\" which means no tortilla or shell, you drop 300 calories immediately. Skip either the cheese, guacamole or sour cream and you're in even better shape. And even with the meat (chicken, steak, pork, ground beef, tofu or fish), it's still going to be a delicious meal!  Sadly, I had the tortilla. And the cheese. And the guacamole. It was absolutely delicious. I even ate about half of the chips with a small dish of medium salsa from their unlimited salsa bar.  Refills from their soda fountain and sweet/unsweet tea urns are free. There are also a couple of outside tables that are under cover from the upstairs shops.  A good meal and I would absolutely return. It's in the back corner of the plaza at Sharon and Fairview. Maybe a little hard to spot, but it's worth checking out for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Salsaritas, Qdoba, Chipotle, Moe's. They are the same and they're different. Of the big chain burrito places, it is not easy to choose a favorite. Moe's has a big plus in their column for the unlimited salsa bar, which is, in a word, awesome. I've been here and poured salsa over my nacho chips and just taken the burrito home to have for dinner. The salsas - yes, more than one - are excellent. Flavorful and tasty and yummy.  This is a nice little Moe's in Ayrsley. Expect the \"Welcome to Moe's\" and the magnificent salsa bar. The staff are super friendly and super fast! My Joey Junior burrito was assembled nearly instantly and was the right size to just barely wrap up without spilling contents.  Parking can be a bit of a challenge in the evening - the wings place across the way overflows parking into this lot."}
{"text":"\"Welcome to Moe's!\" Yep, they shouted at me when I walked in. I wasn't super hungry, so I went with the \"Joey Junior\". It's a smaller sized burrito but it still comes with the rest of the basket filled with chips. So there's still a huge amount of food!  I topped the chips with a few healthy scoops of salsa from the salsa bar and ended up taking the untouched burrito home for the next day's lunch. It was still excellent.  Large seating area with a TV or two that were tuned into a sports channel. And free wi-fi. Excellent!  I love Moe's!"}
{"text":"Welcome to Moe's! This Moe's in the Epicenter. Same Moe's experience as others that I've been to with the ordering of your burrito or whatever, passing down the assembly line of adding starches, proteins and veggies to it. Once paid, there's the usual (excellent!) salsa bar of Moe's salsas.  On the plus side, it was not especially busy when I popped in for a quesadilla to go.  Moe's!"}
{"text":"Welcome to Moe's, right here in Fort Mill. Speedy service for my Homewrecker with chicken to go. Love the chips, nice and light. Salsa bar, yum.  Not exactly easy to eat in the car, but I got 'er done.  Outside seating available, but probably not a brilliant idea in January."}
{"text":"Bland, overcooked food, stale chips, disgusting salsa display, disgustingly dirty floors and counters, rude unprofessional employees. Seriously disappointing. We had to remind our cashier for a side of guacamole four times before he finally got someone to get it for us meanwhile he's drinking soda and chatting it up with a coworker. The employees were more concerned about goofing off than the quality of their food and the customer service. I asked for mushrooms for my burrito and I was given one slice!! Tiny tiny amounts of everything. This restaurant does not stand a chance with Chipotle near by. This chain is literally the worst!"}
{"text":"Learned my lesson at Moe's today. Ordered a bowl and they were very stingy on the product used. I guess if you order a burrito that's when they pile it on. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Long, slow line and ultimately not worth the excruciating wait for so so food. Their ordering system just seems slow and inefficient. 20 minutes just to order, then another 10 before I was paying. And the line didn't seem that long. My quesadilla was just OK, after all that. Forget this place."}
{"text":"Just had my first experience at Moe's, and I have to say, never again! The whole place seemed terribly lacking in management and the kids running the place need some serious training. Handling cash and scratching your head with a gloved hand is not acceptable! The kitchen and dining areas were very dirty and neglected, portions were skimpy for the price, and most of the food was wilted or dried out. Not a good experience at all."}
{"text":"Came in at 6 pm. Moderately busy. 4 people working. One kid was working very hard and super polite. One lady was working steadily, but not friendly. They were on the line. One girl at the cash register was doing nothing else while the other two ran circles around her. Would stand there doing nothing for minutes at a time with ten people in line. Fourth guy was in the back on his phone. Out of guacamole. Literally all five salsa bowls were empty. One employee walked up, played with the scoops, scowled and walked away. Half an hour later? Still empty. Several soda options non-functional. Garbage overflowing. No tray to eat in."}
{"text":"Moe's is my favorite casual Mexican restaurant of all time! I can't say one bad thing about this place. Their food is delicious, the service is wonderful, they have a vast array of menu options, topping options and salsa's. The chips come with your meal here! The queso is to die for! And who could forget the cool coca-cola freestyle machine! The music and art work here is right up my alley too."}
{"text":"As far as Moe's goes, this location checks most all of the good boxes.  First off, Moe's Monday is a great deal and would recommend!  $6 for burrito/burrito bowl, chips and a drink, #score!  Staff is usually always friendly, as with most Moe's locations.  They move you though the line quickly, I would say faster than most other locations around town.  I've always found the tables are pretty clean, which isn't always the case at other stores.    Parking here is a little tighter than normal I would say, but not too bad.  Might have a small walk, and usually the mattress store next door isn't too busy so can get a spot there.  Logistically there is also a light near the intersection here in case you need to make a left coming or going.    Definitely recommend this location for your next burrito fix!"}
{"text":"My very first experience eating at Moes Southwest Grill was this location. It's been many years ago, but the food was dead on perfect. Since then I have eaten at a few other locations and the quality seems to be the same from one restaurant to the other so they obviously follow the company guidelines on how to prepare the particular dishes.  They are very accommodating if you don't want certain things or if you'd like a little more of something and they're always unbelievably polite. They are always clean and they keep their trash emptied on a regular basis which is very nice since you're supposed to bus your own table and you don't want to fight with the trashcan while you're trying to leave. This is also a very family friendly location and the kids just love the chips and the salsa and queso dip. (I do to!)"}
{"text":"We stopped in at Moe's on our way home. While located in a pretty busy area the strip mall that Moe's is attached to had an easy entrance and exit, making it a convenient pit stop. They were pretty quick and friendly and we were back on the road in no time. Just have to say that one thing I dislike about Moe's is the volume of music they pump into the joint...particularly in the bathroom. It's way too loud for a simple fast food restaurant.  I ordered the Homewrecker burrito, and stuffed it with some pork, black beans, veggies and guac. I just love going to a place like this and making my own burrito from scratch! It was pretty tasty, and an added bonus was that it's easy to eat one-handed while driving. The burrito was wrapped up nice and tight and left very little mess.   The missus ordered the Art Vandalay Jr, which was a smaller vegetarian burrito. Moe's is one of the few fast food chains where it's really quick and easy to grab a veggie meal on the go, and she was not disappointed in her burrito. One last thing to note is that all burritos come with an order of chips and salsa. The chips were fresh, but had that \"oily\" taste and feel to them. For a fast food place, I thought the salsa was pretty decent.  This Moe's location is convenient for us when traveling to and from Myrtle Beach when we need to stop for a bite to get us through the rest of the trip. I'm sure we will be stopping back in again."}
{"text":"I had never been to a Moe's before, and I was pretty pleased with it. It wasn't as tasty as Chipolte but it was far better than going to Taco Bell for your Mexican fast food needs.  They have a few menu suggestions, but I went for the make your own burrito. You just tell them what kind of meat and other stuff you want in it and they make it right in front of you. I went with pork (my meat of choice at any Mexican joint), rice, pinto beans, corn salsa, onions and lettuce. They had plenty of other toppings/ fillers as well.  The burrito was a pretty decent size (especially since you can put as many ingredients as you like in it) and came with a heaping handful of chips. Mind you, this isn't part of a \"value meal\", but just something that comes with all their entrees. My wife ordered tacos and got the chips also, and we could have easily split one order of chips between us, as neither of us finished our own. We did make it a value meal for one entree in order to get a side of queso dip and a drink to share. The dip was a very rich, creamy, cheesy sauce that went well with the chips. That stuff is pretty dangerous in the calories dept. though, so don't eat an entire order of the stuff!  All in all, it was decent Mexican fast food. I liked how it was all made in front of you, but at the same time it was kind of a turn-off because all the toppings are stored in front of you like they are at Subway. Also, I felt that my pork was a bit bland and I didn't really taste it. Still, it was definitely worth the price as far as fast food goes, and you definitely get your moneys worth."}
{"text":"The burrito was pretty good. Soft drinks were $2.79 each. Moe Monday is not as much of a deal as it used to be.  The pork still makes a darn good burrito! The restaurant appears to be clean and tidy.  The restroom was clean."}
{"text":"Unlike the previous reviewer I've not experienced any problems at this location and rate it in-line with other Moe's locations.  I almost always order a single taco (overachiever) and with the chips it's plenty of food for one person (assuming you get standard toppings)."}
{"text":"This location was one of the best and then last year something happened and the staff went down hill,  they let it stay dirty worth broken drink machine. Just not good. They have in the last 3 months or so brought in a new manager and the place had really improved.  The staff is friendly again and cleanliness is back. Five them another try!"}
{"text":"Moe's is my all time favorite Mexican Restaurant. I love that they yell \"Welcome to Moe's\" when I arrive and the steak tacos are to die for. Everyone I've taken there has become a devout lover of Moe's as well. I highly suggest trying it if you haven't already. It's amazing."}
{"text":"Overall great. Service was great. Menu set up was awesome. Food was nice. Outside setting."}
{"text":"My fiancé loves Moes, so we go to moes on many occasions. Especially when we are at the mall! We also happened to get coupons for this location so we came to this one. It just seems..... Blah. The service is just okay, and the food quality isn't that great. Pass on this Moes!"}
{"text":"The fiancé LOVES Moe's, so that means I come too. I personally prefer Chipotle, but Moe's Monday is a common occurrence in our home. The queso cheese is amazing in a burrito, but I don't think theres much else going for this location. They're pretty rude here (not always, but more often than not) and they don't always say \"Welcome to Moe's!\" when people walk in!! Isn't that part of the fun?! The ingredients are usually fresh and I like their nachos and assortment of salsas."}
{"text":"Restaurant review Wow what a disappointment. I have seen Moe's by the chicagoland area, but I have never actually eaten at any of the locations before. I was happy to hear that this opened up as it is closer than Chipotle on Prospect. Someone should be fired for the design and layout for the restaurant. I placed my order through the app which was quite easy to use, however when I wanted to place a second order for my wife, my credit card was rejected due to similar transactions so I decided to drive out to the location and order it in person. First the parking lot before Brixx pizza opened was a disaster. Super tight parking spaces, one way for traffic to go. It was a nightmare trying to park my car. Next you go in and order your burrito like Chipotle. For one of the orders I did not want cheese and the both of the other burritos did not need lettuce. Somehow I ended up with cheese on the one I didn't want and lettuce in both. One person trying to get the order for two burritos should not be difficult. Staff was not friendly at all and said why did you not tell me earlier. I got to the end of the line and paid. I also picked up my online order. There was a big box that was sitting in the middle of the table without any heat lamp. If you order too early, your burrito maybe stone cold when you come to pick it up. I did get a ridiculous amount of tortilla chips enough to feed 6 people. The salsa station is great as there is quite a variety and the spicy ones have quite a kick. The final straw was when I brought the food home, my wife and sister in law had burritos that had probably 3-4 oz of meat only. When you looked at the burrito after a bite all you could see was the tortilla skin, small amounts of rice, lettuce, and a sliver of chicken running down the middle. I wish I would have paid attention to how they made the burritos, but they were quite disappointed. All and all this is a big bust!  Pros: online ordering app, Monday' 5.95 all burrito special, free tortilla chips and salsa  Cons: crazy small parking lot, apathetic staff, small amount of protein portions, no heat lamp for online orders  Hidden deals:  1. Free chips/salsa 2. 5.95 any burrito special on Monday only 3. Sign up for e-club to get free queso for your chips  Health code rating: A, appears clean and new. No health reports online at this time."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to the Moe's multiple times and the last time we went was very disappointing. The staff was not interested in servicing us. We had to start the conversation ourselves and when we were helped it was not helpful. We ordered a chicken quesadilla but never got asked if we wanted anything other then chicken or cheese on it. The worker just assumed that was it. Before we could say anything else the quesadilla was being heated. We didn't get asked if we wanted any sides either. The order was poorly packaged togo as well. All around it was disappointing."}
{"text":"The place is awesome. Similar to rubios or chipotle but more ingredient choices and free chips and salsa!!!"}
{"text":"4/28/17, 12:45 pm, T1, A gates, - Poor customer service. Staff were talking to each other while we were ordering, hence,'put corn when she asked me two seconds ago if I wanted  and said No. Chicken was dry and cold.  The asian guy put too much rice! Over priced bowl and burrito. $28"}
{"text":"Won't knock your pantaloons off, but it probably won't disappoint either. Snuggled up next to a pizza place, a sub shop and a coffee-addict's dream, Moe's offers you options - from quesidillas and tacos to salads and their infamous monster-size burritos.    Last time I went, I had one Overachiever taco. My total was barely $3. If you are a hungry hippo, you may need two. All orders come with a helping of crunchy chips and access to the salsa bar. Oh, and if you need a tasty beverage, you have the option of the soda fountain or bottled water, seltzer and Mexican beer.   The place is pretty clean with plenty of seating. I like that you can hop on a stool at the window and watch the outside world. The staff is friendly - mandatory greeting everyone with \"Welcome to Moe's!\"   If you're a fan of Mexican food, try Moe's. I've had their burrito, quesillda and soft-shell taco. Each and every time I've eaten here, I've left satisfied with plenty of reason to go back again."}
{"text":"Food was Meh. Didn't really think anything had much flavor, but I choked it down on the plane as a necessity. So kind of pricey, even though it's a big burrito, cause it's a big mound of flavorlessness. I didn't even finish mine, couldn't choke it down. Just ate enough to not be starving on my flight home.  But what I absolutely hated was the rip off of \"Seinfeldisms\" on the menu. What the hell does Mexican food have to do with Seinfeld???? I don't think I ever saw them eat Mexican food on the show ever!!   But it was really the STUPID names of everything that made me really HATE ITt!! SO MUCH THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO EAT THERE. If our flight hadn't been delayed an hour+ I would have not bought food, I only did so out of absolute desperation."}
{"text":"Food had no taste to it. The lady working the line looked so miserable and wouldn't interact with any of the customers. Super uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I will be giving this place 5 stars for the food and the service as everything within the restaurant's control was perfect.  The food was perfect - portions were plentiful and very tasty .  They had that Coke machine where you customize your drink which I also thought was neat.    The problem was that a basketball team with young kids was in there having a party of some sorts.  The restaurant's walls didn't help suppress the noise and it was very loud in there.  But this group got to be more and more out of control, that had I been the manager, I would've told them to cut it out.  McDonald's is down the road.  I can safely assume that the manager would've gotten in trouble by his higher-ups had he done such a thing.    I love Moe's and will come back, but I wish places would have a policy on controlling groups of kids.  Plus McDonald's is right up the road."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location in numerous months.   & now I remember why.       They were out of Mexican rice, black beans, chips, & 2-different salsa's.       The soda machine was also out of numerous different flavors."}
{"text":"This place gets one star for the taste of their chicken and queso.  I will NEVER go back to this place, again.  I would only eat here if I was on \"Naked and Afraid.\"  My husband and I went in around 6pm yesterday.  There was no one in the restaurant, first red flag.  As we're walking to the front, I see the employee running from the back of the restaurant where she was sitting down.  I ordered a bowl and had to wait for chicken to be cut because they were out....um it's dinner time how do you not have this ready to go?  They had no grilled peppers or onions, I could wait for that, there was barely any pico de gallo and there were 2 bottles of sour cream, please tell me how neither of them had enough to give me a full squirt of sour cream.  You know the ketchup bottles when it's close to the end and it makes that farting noise we all laugh at?  Yes, that's what I got sour cream fart particles to top my sad looking chicken bowl.  Someone said don't come here with 30-minutes left because there's no food, well there's no food at 6pm at night."}
{"text":"Talk about EXPENSIVE!! Had a hankering for mexican food and this was not good! We got 6 tacos (three for each of us) and one drink, it was almost $30! and they were not even filling. Just blah! No bueno!"}
{"text":"I love Moe's and get Postmates or takeout from this one often. I haven't had a bad experience until today. Something was very odd with my burrito. It tasted terrible. I figured out the beans were the culprit. I'm not sure if it was just a bad batch or if the were old. They had an almost rotten smell to them. I ended up throwing away my burrito. If you see this today definitely don't get the beans."}
{"text":"I gave this place another chance- mistake! Soggy tortilla, pretty tasteless overall. The chips and salsa were pretty good last time I ate here but not so great this visit. The lack of details/ingredients about the menu items led to me not knowing if the burrito I received was composed of the \"right stuff\". And the employee making the burrito didn't know much about their food.  I had the pork burrito and it was among the saddest pork burritos I've had in a long time. It's too bad because this place is convenient when shopping in the area and I imagine it could be so much better."}
{"text":"The staff was helpful, friendly & quick. I was able to build the quesadilla of my dreams because they 20 fresh ingredients you can choose from. I had chicken, bacon, lettuce & grilled vegetables. It was awesome.  I got a side of queso. It's hot and silky. It's mild with a hint of jalapeños to add flavor. You get free chips with every order. You also get another chance to add flavor with a trip to the salsa bar.  This was first visit. I will be back."}
{"text":"Good place for fast burrito fix.  I drove by here and was in and out in probably less than 10min.  Granted it was a Monday night... but it was still prime dinner time (in my opinion).  So without any line, I got my way pretty easily.    I don't know if the unlimited chips and salsa is a new thing or not, but I was not expecting any chips in my bag at all when I stopped int to get my burrito.  It was a nice surprise - but they probably make up for the chips by selling queso.  I have been to this location in the summer and had the opportunity to eat outside in the patio area (in the back/side of the building).  It would have been great but the only thing I remember was a pungent smell.  We thought the trash just hadn't been changed out in a while, but when we were leaving we noticed the grease dumpster right outside the patio area...... DOH.  Even though our noses were not happy...we still managed to eat (which does say a lot about the food I guess)."}
{"text":"Every time I come here lately, I have a worse experience than the previous one.    I always order the same thing here, the Closetalker salad in the shell.    Today, the shell was stale and rubbery.  Everything from the black beans to the salsas tasted like it was right out of a can.  Maybe it was, but its never tasted like it before.  I think I can now cross this Moe's off of my regular lunch spots."}
{"text":"of all the fresh mex restaurants around town, Moe's is my favorite.  I think it's the salsa bar.  Actually I think you have better choices at Moe's than at Qdoba, Salsaritas, and Chipotle.  You can customize your meal in 370 different combinations.   I usually get the closetalker salad with chicken, black beans, pico, cilantro, cheese, cucumbers, and instead of the their dressings iI use the salsas from their salsa bar.  I also like fact that they use shredded lettuce in the salad.  They experimented with romaine one time but I didn't like that as much.  At Moe's you always feel welcome because you are always greeted when you walk in the door.  \"Welcome to Moe's\"."}
{"text":"I thought it was weird that a Moe's just opened up right next to a Panchero's, but at the very least I figured I'd like at least one or both of them. After all they're both pretty conveniently located, but alas, after eating at both I just found myself wanting Chipotle. I hate to admit it because I recall thinking Moe's in Chicago was pretty good, but this was just mediocre. The only upside would be the salsa bar and the fact that they have melted queso. Bummer."}
{"text":"Moe's is one of our family's favorite places. Often on Sunday we gather four generations (ages seven to ninety one) for dinner, and the kids eat free. The staff is friendly and remembers us. They customize orders to accommodate a dairy intolerance. The food is great and the setting is fun. When we enter the staff shouts out \"Welcome to Moe's.\""}
{"text":"Not best, not worst- compares to chipotle minus the food poisoning.   Nachos with pork, queso, black beans, salsa, olives. Chick didn't drain pork prior to dumping on chips causing them to get soggy super fast. Chips are super thin so broke easy trying to scoop.   David got a burrito. He didn't complain but he was starving so hard to get good feedback when you are that hungry.   Food is meh in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is great! Food is wonderful and chip and salsa is included with the price. What more could you ask for"}
{"text":"Moe's is not only fast but the food is great! I have visited at 4 different times and have been amazed at the service and quality of food at each visit .  Chipotle you better step up because this is truly your competition!"}
{"text":"Explain to me how you run out of guacamole as well as $1 bills to make change at 12:30 on a Thursday? Were you not expecting customers today? Most of the employees were subpar and worked as if it were their first week on the job. So many other better places to choose from in the area. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Ok! i went back, ( its right next to my house, and chipotle is 20 min away) got the steak again, and was super pissed because i thought they didn't add my lettuce and cheese... it was there, but all bunched up in the last few bites..!i guess whoever trained these kids was higher than me..."}
{"text":"Good Mexican style option for lunch in the busy Cleveland Clinic food court. Service is fast and friendly. Having limited options on the menu helps it make it easier to decide. It's either quesadilla, burrito, tacos, or salad. Then you can customize with a limited number of ingredients. Food was just ok. In my opinion, it needed more spice. Their famous queso had no taste."}
{"text":"It's like the baby of Chipotle and Panchero. Great selection of ingredients but enough \"meh\"-ness to keep it from a 5-star review.  I went here when it first opened and returned again recently. I've never ran into an issue with service. The place could be cleaner in general.   What I like the best: portion sizes are HUGE! I like the salsa bar they have at the end of the line. Chips comes with your meal."}
{"text":"Welp, i decided to stop in to this location because i hadn't ate  Moe's in years since i worked at wells fargo years ago. Then i loved it. This location has got to be the worst ever! The service was slow as ever, and i felt rushed, and my nacho's although they looked okay they were not very appetizing nor anything tasted fresh. Im in true belief its just this particular location. Never again!"}
{"text":"Three stars is for the community support this Moe's is giving.   Unfortunately, the servers need to learn about serving without chatting with other servers. These servers serve with gloved hands BUT my server used her hands to grab onto another server's arms!!! Then, she asked me if I wanted more on my Homewreaker. Sadly, no thank you."}
