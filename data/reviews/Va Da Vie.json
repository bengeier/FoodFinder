{"text":"Amazing, wonderful gelato and very nice service too!! The only thing that could make this better is if they were open later!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious Gelato made with high quality, local ingredients. Try a taste of everything before you pick a flavor. It'll be hard to choose!"}
{"text":"Amazing gelato! Cute spot in middle of parking lot. Clean and simple. Natural ingredients."}
{"text":"I'm almost embarrassed to say how much we go here. Worth the drive from Ballantyne! The loveliest service and amazing atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This place has GREAT gelato! It's all fresh and they consistently change flavors with nice new fresh options that help keep things interesting. I also like the smaller portions, helps you enjoy but not over do it like so many other places these days.

If you love gelato this place won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic find! Their gelato is yummy. All the ingredients taste fresh. Tried the vanilla bean, lemon, and chocolate. I would honestly love to have had more - but the prices are a little steep which would probably limit me to choosing this place only once in a blue moon."}
{"text":"The owner of this place is an awesome guy. My husband and I went there tonight, and we served with such kindness. After they had closed for the night, people kept coming, and instead of ignoring, the owner spoke to each one of them and asked them to come back. He shared with them that they had a website, and to be sure to check it out. Both my husband and I were really blessed by his kindness and hospitality. I hope we can spread the word!"}
{"text":"Icecream - pistachio and coffee bean flavours were awesome !! 
Location & parking - it's a white lil house (kind of) at the center of the shopping area ! So u might miss. Parking is plentiful 

Downs -- u can taste only one flavor  and portion size is small !!!"}
{"text":"Their gelato flavors are definitely delicious. Especially the lemon ricotta. Must try."}
{"text":"This is a truly excellent artisan level gelato shop - also sorbet. Extremely helpful owners. Highly recommended. Creative flavors and fairly priced for high end products."}
{"text":"We love Va Da Vie. The owners are the nicest addition to Park Road Shopping Center and the Gelato is delicious. Whenever we've visited (many times), we feel like we are visiting friends. A small serving goes a long way!"}
{"text":"Amazing gelato. Worth the time!  I've only had better in Italy.  The ingredients are so fresh and perfect."}
{"text":"Gelato is good, but their hours are extremely limited and as others have noted, the service is lacking. I really wish this place would figure out how to stay open later during good weather and not be so unfriendly to patrons who clearly enjoy their gelato!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place. Every flavor is handmade and delicious. Even things you'd never expect (lemon ricotta? Avocado honey?!) will vie for your attention. The staff is always courteous and will tell you how each flavor is made. Cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Best gelato in Charlotte. Great selection and very friendly staff. Best place to go on a hot summer day. No contest."}
{"text":"Really distinctive flavors and very, very good.  I had avocado honey orange, my husband had blood orange sorbet, and the kids loved the stracciatella.  All were delicious.  It's expensive but delicious."}
{"text":"Initially I asked for 3 different samples because I didn't see the sign limiting 1 sample per person.  The manager or owner was still nice enough to give me 2 different samples while explaining the flavors to me.  Fresh Banana is the flavor I ended up getting, some of the best gelato I've ever had."}
{"text":"Delicious does not even begin to describe the gelato served at Va Da Vie.  Live near or far, the trip to Park Road Shopping Center for this gelato experience is more than worth the trip.  The staff here are very friendly and let you try as many flavors as it takes to decide which flavor(s) you would like to walk away with in your cup.   Sit outside on the patio chairs or inside at the bar top stools.  Either way, your gelato experience will be grand and you'll be scraping at the bottom of your cup wishing there was more."}
{"text":"Gelato was good, but this is NOT a kid-friendly place. In fact, they couldn't get us out fast enough. Once outside to enjoy the gelato, they came and asked us to please make sure we didn't drop anything... OUTSIDE. I appreciate you taking pride in your establishment, but don't make people with kids feel like they aren't welcome. We won't be returning with or without kids."}
{"text":"Our Parents of Allergic Kids members always discuss establishments which are food allergy friendly. One of our members had this to say:



\"I have to rave about Va da Vie Gelato in Park Road shopping complex. They make their own gelato with fresh ingredients and have 2 dairy free sorbet options. The owner (I think that's who he was) is very knowledgeable and he said he has never allowed any peanuts because he is thinking of people with peanut allergies, even though people request a peanut flavor often. They do have pistachio, hazelnut and almond I believe. Every gelato and sorbet are in their own container and have their own dedicated spoon to avoid cross contamination. We felt comfortable with them.Definitely check them out if you think it would work for your allergies, and I am sure they can review all of their ingredients with you. It is so yummy!\"

Thank you!"}
{"text":"Best gelato ever. Nicest owners who make everything fresh from scratch -- local, organic, whole ingredients."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious.  I stopped by the week before they opened.  Actually, I drove by super slow and stalkerish to try and see what this new place was.  The owner came outside to invite me in.  How nice is that?  He explained how they make all their gelato from scratch from local ingredients.  He and his wife went to school to learn how to make it the authentic way.  I came back after they opened and was able to sample every flavor.  Everything was just delicious.  So far I've enjoyed the lemon ricotta and chocolate hazelnut (nutella anyone?!?!) and have stolen tastes of the strawberry, pineapple and blueberry sorbets from my kids.  So so good."}
{"text":"I have traveled extensively through Europe and tried some of the best gelato in existence (Grom in Florence Italy was our favorite) and this is right up there with the best. Everything is made in house and the owners told us the back story of hand selecting the ingredients for each flavor. The consistency was incredible, as only fresh gelato stored properly in deep covered metal cans will be (again, a sign of a true gelateria). There aren't any other places like this in Charlotte. Do yourself a favor and try it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The ingredients are always top notch and everything about every flavor is considered. You can tell these folks really care about the product and the sources they use to create it. Staff is always friendly. The owners are great and I always notice them making efforts to ensure everyone has a good experience. I've read a couple of their bad reviews from others and I guess all you need to know is that there's a Ben and Jerrys across the street if you're looking for that-and hey, sometimes that's all ya want. This place is different and it's worth what they charge. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Italy has nothing on Charlotte, now that Va Da Vie has arrived at the Park Road Shopping Center. 

Before I give you a review on the pistachio gelato made from Bronte nuts from the volcanic soils at the base of a Sicilian volcano and the two types of vanilla beans, painstakingly scraped into each batch of vanilla...let me tell you what I know about gelato. 

Several years ago, when I lived in the QC, my husband and I wanted to open a gelato franchise that shall-not-be-named.  Once we discovered the product was made from a pasteurized pre-made mix and the so-called \"natural\" flavor lineup included blue BUBBLEGUM, we knew this wasn't going to work. (Not to mention, the franchise fee was insane.) 

Fast forward several years to today, and my husband and I have had many, many cups of gelato from gelaterias all over the world. Va Da Vie stacks up. 

The owners, John  and Wendy are so passionate and sweet, they can talk to you for an eternity (in an interesting way, not a \"get-me-outta-here\" way) about their locally sourced dairy and sorbets, made with up to 50% fresh local fruits.  

I highly recommend the hazelnut, pistachio, and the vanilla along with the lemon ricotta.  Can't wait to visit Charlotte again and support this wonderful local business!  

PS:  It's inside the former water store on a tiny island in Park Road Shopping Center."}
{"text":"So I just tried Va Da Vie after reading the Yelp reviews.  This Gelato will not disappoint!  I tried the Lemon Ricatto, and it was absolutely delicious.  I also tried the Pistachio and it was very good.  Can't wait to go back and try more flavors.  The owners were very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"The best in town (possibly universe). Awesome owners - we have been visiting since they opened with our daughter. 

Can not rate the product or management more highly. Delicious, fresh, local - what more can you ask for :)"}
{"text":"Love this shop. Their gelato is amazing and I love the fact that they use the best local, organic ingredients that are in season. The owners are also very nice and get to know their customers. We try to come to Va Da Vie at least once a month for a special treat and what a treat it is. They also always have a very good sorbet option for those that are dairy free."}
{"text":"Va Da Vie is basically the only game in town when it comes to gelato. Their gelato tastes good and I like that they use local ingredients, but it's pricey by Charlotte standards.

My favorites: Pistachio, lemon ricotta, and banana.

I'd easily bump this review to 4 stars if they had better hours -- it would be so nice if they were open later in the summer, on weekends, or both!"}
{"text":"This is a must try.  Tucked in a free standing building in Park Road Shopping center, it's easy to miss.  It's right outside Cantina and Fuel pizza.  Anyway, stopped there last night and the gelato was outstanding.  I had the Stracciatella and it was amazing.  Creamy with the chocolate crunch it was a great blend.  And the best part, the owners were wonderful people.  We stopped by a few minutes before they were closing.  They were friendly and we chatted for a while about their focus on quality products and tasting several flavors before we decided on what we all wanted.  

Great product and great people.  Support your local businesses.  This one is a treasure."}
{"text":"The gelato is amazing!  The flavors are out of this world.  So fresh!  I had the pistachio and my friend had the fresh strawberry.  Want to come back for the Chai spice.  

Such a cute shop!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We finally got around to visiting this place almost 1.5 years after it opened. The owner was very engaging and both husband and wife shared details of each flavor and what goes in it once they found out it was our first visit. We tasted Strawberry, Pistachio (not for the weak), Chai (I am from India and trust me this is phenomenal), Bacci (milk chocolate hazelnut) and Strateccitella -  milk cream with chocolate bits....but wait with a salty after taste. We couldn't decide which was the best, we loved them all. These guys are so passionate about what they do. We have several friends who have been to Italy and said this is as good as any Italian gelato. It does not leave a sweet after taste, no milky coating on your tongue. BEST we have ever had. We live down in Indian Land SC and trek all the way there when we want something sweet. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"We loved it. We have finally found a great gelato shop in Charlotte.
Have the pistachio. 
Bring back your friends, they will love it.
Get back on yelp and let the people know what you think."}
{"text":"Decent gelato but definitely my last visit since I walked in, ordered from one associate and paid the second associate. Some where in the process, the owner/manager came to the front and as I headed out the door mustered up \"Excuse me\".  It dawned on my she ASSUMED that I had not paid. How could I steal ice cream in a 2x4 shop when your associate had to hand it to me? 

Sad this will be my last visit to Va Da Vie. I don't frequent businesses that jump to assuming a customer didn't pay, versus asking or even more graciously inquiring if they could help me with anything else.

I hope you learn from this review not to assume all minority customers are potential thieves. It is, after all, 2016, even here in the south."}
{"text":"We found this Fabulous gelato shop by accident and we cannot wait until our next visit. 

Their gelati have perfect texture and they are as good as our favorite places in Barcelona, Sydney, Nice and Florence.

You must try their Stracciatella and Bacio."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness.....gelato time!!

My husband and I were leaving Cantina (I was very full and ready to head home). However, my husband saw gelato out of the corner of his eye and it was a straight bee-line towards the small store. So glad we stumbled upon this place!! 

Va Da Vie is a cute little store right in the middle of Park Road Shopping. There were two people working when we got there and they were extremely nice and helpful. They let us try as many flavors as we wanted and told us what ingredients were in each flavor. I tried the Cannoli...made with fresh ricotta and my husband tried the strawberry...made with local strawberries. Both were amazing! We settled on getting a regular size with half Pistachio and half Strawberry. The pistachio was absolutely amazing. Truly havent had this good of gelato since we returned a few years ago from Venice!!!

This place is absolutely a must try for anyone who loves good gelato!"}
{"text":"The gelato is good, but wow is it expensive. The cups are very small and they definitely are careful not to fill it too high. This is not a place to go if you're really hungry. The service was friendly, but I didn't get the owner that others have commented on in the reviews. I'd probably come back in a few years after I sell some stock"}
{"text":"Though my husband wasn't a fan, the rest of us enjoyed our gelato. I had to dock a star though because they were rather stingy. Only one sample per customer. We were the only ones there at the time. I've been to ice cream/gelato shops far busier (with lines out the door and around the building) and have never seen a limit on samples. They also asked us to hold on to our sample spoons. When I received an additional spoon with my ice cream, I heard one of the workers say, \"they still have their spoon.\" I'm all for saving spoons, but seems a little much."}
{"text":"Owner was very nice and friendly. Best gelato in the QC. Highly recommend the strawberry flavor, it tastes like real strawberry.."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best! The taste is out of this world and the owners are always helpful. The place is always so clean - immaculate!"}
{"text":"I am a big gelato fan... This place is finally what Charlotte's been looking for!  I had the creamy almond, and my wife had the chocolate... The other best gelato I've ever had was at Luna Rosa in Greenville South Carolina. This gelato definitely gives it a run for the money!  Let's support this place because we don't want it to go away ....gelato is hard-to-find in Charlotte!... At least good gelato is!"}
{"text":"Great, authentic Italian gelato.  We had pistachio, almond, and bachio (chocolate hazelnut). All really well done.

I've lived in Italy and had a lot of gelato. This place is as good as it gets and would do well and the streets of Italy. They make everything from scratch in the shop.

Gelato is denser and richer than ice cream, so the portions look smaller but they last longer.  Try multiple flavors together, it's wonderful."}
{"text":"They don't have the Giolliti view but their gelato is every bit as good.  I don't eat much ice cream but this place will make sure I eat the best when I do. 

Bravo!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The owner and his family are extremely friendly and will offer you as many samples as you would like, all while telling you what that particular Gelato was made with. I love that they work with local farmers for their fresh fruit sorbets. I had the vanilla and coffee bean flavors which were so rich in flavor and creamy smooth! 

I can't wait to return and I will surely spread the word about this yummy fresh Gelato!"}
{"text":"Va Da Vie is in the parking lot across from the Hallmark and Book Store Shop in Park Road Shopping Center. This small shop is immaculate.  I ordered the Lemon Ricotta (Small $4.25). It really was delicious. My only complaint was they did not have any business cards, or brochures I could take and pass out to my co-workers, family and friends. They need to provide something to take with, it would drive more business for them and I know some folks need to know the ingredients and calorie count which they could not provide.  

Overall a delightful quaint little shop and delicious gelato!"}
{"text":"John and Wendy have done an amazing job bringing gelato with real fresh ingredients to the area. They mix their own flavors using these premium products. Located in  the Park Road shopping center it is a free standing building in the middle if the parking lot. Recently opening on May 16th this provides an excellent place to enjoy gelato the real Italian way. There is outdoor patio seating as well as benches and an indoor counter. Wonderful people, amazing creamy gelato and a convenient location make this a great place to spend the afternoon or just stop by on your way through. It will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Found this by surprise, amazing gelato. Owner is super friendly and knowledgeable, and you can tell they truly care about their craft."}
{"text":"Fantastic gelato!  Locally sourced ingredients and a staff/ownership that truly cares for their product. Move aside froyo!"}
{"text":"Calling all parents: when your kids want ice cream take them here! All the gelato is handmade with fresh ingredients, so it's a healthy frozen treat when you're craving something sweet. Bonus: their sorbet is made with local fruit, which means the flavor is phenomenal! 

They are generous with their sample scoops, which makes it difficult to pick a flavor. You can pick 2 flavors when you order a regular size cup and 3 flavors when you order a large. I ended up choosing the cantaloupe sorbet, lemon ricotta gelato, and stracciatella gelato. Sooo good! I would definitely come back again to try the other flavors. 

If you're looking for legit gelato, come here. Your tastebuds will thank you."}
{"text":"They had very few flavors but I tried the pear sorbet. I cannot brag about this flavor enough. It was so good! A very refreshing taste. Thinking about it I want more! If you're ever in the South Park area please head on over and give them a try. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality. Thai place is expensive for the portion size, but it's easy to tell they use great ingredients and its fresh. The flavors seem to change so you may not be able to get what you liked the next time around...but that leads to trying more flavors. Great service, the employees are very knowledgable and seem to be proud of the product. Def worth a try."}
{"text":"Delicious yet mega expensive! Photos don't show how tiny tiny tiny the serving is and it must depend on the dipper, because our double flavor (not scoops) costs extra and the portion does not escape the height  of the bowl.  Very creamy and a nice array of flavors with samples allowed.  Tiny mini kid cup sets you back 5.00 and still hungry after this  enjoyable creamy rich and fresh treat.  Dippers were friendly, but just cause it is South Park doesn't mean over price point things for adults and kiddos.  Located in the middle of the parking lot.  Try the lemon ricotta."}
{"text":"Stracciatella, bacio and coffee gelato are my favorites. It's one of the finest gelato
I ever tasted!! It's comparable or better than  the famous Venchi gelato in Florence, . The texture is perfectly smooth and is made fresh daily from the best and fresh ingredients.It's truly a hidden gem in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Tastes amazing! The staff is really helpful in trying out flavors, which are all very rich! Love it :)"}
{"text":"Excellent gelato! My scoop of coffee and strachiatella (chocolate chip Italian style) was delicious and creamy. The fresh ingredients are apparent in the delicious flavors. It's located in the center of Park Rd shopping center. I'm looking forward to the next trip."}
{"text":"Gelato is pretty good, I'll be honest. But I don't know what people are talking about with good customer service...I asked to try some samples and was told they don't do samples when there's a line. Understandably so...but the old gentleman helping me asked me which one I wanted to try and when I told him he proceeded to list out the ingredients of the gelato for a LONG period of time (seems counterproductive to previous statement about not wanting to slow the line by giving samples). It was apparent the guy didn't want to give me samples after asking me if I was there by myself. I've never been to an ice cream place that refuses to give you samples...maybe it's a gelato thing."}
{"text":"This is by far the best gelato ever! (Including the gelato I've had in Italy) The owner obviously takes great pride in using the freshest, most authentic ingredients that come directly from Italy. Delicioso!!!"}
{"text":"Woooohoooooooo!!!!!!! The best! Love the cannoli is like nothing I have ever had. Can't wait to go back and try more"}
{"text":"Pistachio was so good, some of the best gelato I've ever had. Pear was also really good, as was the blood orange. Just a small unassuming shop in the middle of a parking lot. Great small business."}
{"text":"Ice cream and all it's variations are my favorite treats.  Va Da Vie serves up a very delightful gelato.  They use real ingredients and you can definitely taste the difference.  For being a small building in the middle of a parking lot, they have managed to create a nice atmosphere for you to enjoy your cold concoction.  I believe it's a family owned establishment and the service is kind. At $4.50 for a small, one flavor, this place gets pricey fast in terms of ice cream, but it's worth the treat."}
{"text":"Great quality but very overpriced Gelato. The large cup is barely larger than their small cup."}
{"text":"Tasty and pricey product for the portion ( I get it it's no DQ, but these cups are tiny). Nice clean and bright atmosphere;however found the workers to be robotic.  We explained this was our first visit and no one offered a smile or recommendations. Plus, we assumed the older gentleman was one of the owners. Oh well, will visit again if I am in the area, but Whole Foods' gelato  will satisfy as a close second."}
{"text":"My first time here. All flavors are outstanding! Tried pistachio, banana & stracciatella. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"visited here today with my father ! Gelato was not bad lil bit expensive tough !"}
{"text":"Two stars because the gelato was okay. Certainly too overpriced for the portion. Quality was notable, however.

My issues lie with the staff and the owners - upon reading the reviews from other patrons, see it's a similar issue. 

They're very curt, not very warm. An individual I'll liken to that of Aunt Lydia (The Handmaid's Tale) directed us in herds, saying people will \"typically fill in\" to the gaps in the building. It's small, I get that - I understand the concept of space, but I also don't want to ride the back of the person in front of me. 

I'll take partial fault for this one because I didn't follow the rules. However, it's how it was handled that rubbed me the wrong way - didn't see the sign, was an honest mistake:

I pulled my phone out to take a quick pic of the Cattabriga Effe batch freezer. Lydia suddenly appears next to me and notes that for the privacy of the patrons and the staff, no photos are allowed with individuals included and that it was \"also mentioned in the sign on the door\" - understood, but the last comment was very condescending in tone. I apologized and said that it was a picture of the word \"Effe.\" I assured her I deleted it. The male owner then halted the line to explain to me a similar reasoning. I repeated I deleted the picture, then we were rushed through. By that point, the group and I decided we wanted to get out of there ASAP. Forget the samples, forget the questions about flavors, just wanted out.

Very unimpressed. I understand the rules and I did apologize for missing them, but after already being scolded for my error from one staff member, is it necessary to be publicly chastised by another?"}
{"text":"About 2 years go my wife and I took an amazing trip to Europe, of which we spent a part in Venice. After 2 separate flights from Germany, a 1 hour water taxi ride, and 30 min walk on cobblestones with suitcases in tow, we finally checked into our hotel in Venice. Sensing a need to hit the 'restart' button, I suggested we go and try some of Italy's famed gelato. Walking up, I was adventurous and ordered pistachio. I never really had/liked pistachio before, but hey, I was on vacation! What ensued was nothing short of magical. Having a major sweet tooth, I like ice cream. However, this put everything I had tasted to shame - by a wide margin! I was hooked and we stopped for gelato at least 3-5 times a day for the rest of the trip. Like I said, I was on vacation!

I told you that story so I could tell you this story. My 3rd or 4th time driving through park road shopping center I spotted the white building of Va Da Vie and wondered 'Is that new? How did I miss this place?' and confirmed they served gelato. Since my days in Venice, I have tried many different gelatos. I would describe my quest as a junkie hoping to hit that initial high, and had all but given up hope. Still, I figured 'whats the worst that could happen' and walked in. After a quick scan of the menu, I ordered the pistachio (I bet you see where this is going). Upon receiving my cup, I took a deep breath and took a bite. The result? I was speechless! In that bite, I found myself transported back to my summer in Venice while my taste buds danced with joy. I had found my unicorn.

These guys are the real deal. With an imported gelato making machine, they use local ingredients to come up with fantastic flavors. I have yet to try something I didn't like. I recommend pistachio (see above), strawberry, and pumpkin (if they have it). Also the owner and staff are incredibly nice and helpful. Once I went in right at closing. Having worked in the service industry, I know this is NOT how you make friends. However, the owner welcomed me in with open arms. Also they will let you sample any of the flavors before making your decision.

What Va Da Vie has going on is something special. I'm glad that I don't have to travel halfway across the world to have some of the best gelato."}
{"text":"I would like to die and be burried in a regular gelato with one scoop of fresh banana and one scoop of stracciatella. Stop reading yelp and go sample every flavor at Va Da Vie."}
{"text":"We're from the DC area but stopped in based on Yelp reviews. My kids LOVED the cannoli gelato and the coffee and chocolate gelato. They had much sexier names but I can't remember them! I highly recommend. Very clean, excellent customer service, great location to just hang out, too!"}
{"text":"Lemon ricotta was wonderfully tasty, chocolate hazelnut memorable but portions forgettable! Super size, hell no, but 3 tablespoonful of gelato for $6.00? Not THAT good! Save your money unless your trying to impress a date. Just don't let the, know what you paid!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious gelato. I'm in town visiting and my dad has raved about it for the past year or so, so obviously I needed to try for myself. The owner had me sample plenty of flavors to find the best flavor for ME, was super knowledgeable about where all of their ingredients came from. I loved the small business atmosphere and the gelato was incredible, will definitely return."}
{"text":"Clean, very welcoming, friendly staff, also the fruits were actually from local!! Def will be going back!! If you like or don't like gelato you still need to try this place. Def deserve a 5"}
{"text":"The gelato is delicious and closest you can find to the real stuff in Italy, but servings are way too small and the owners can be extremely rude! Will not be back."}
{"text":"The Gelato is some of the best I have ever had. Also, the owner is very friendly, and really loves what he does. I saw him hold his store open for some late arrivals, it was only a few dollars, but I got the impression that he really just didn't want to disappoint them."}
{"text":"I kept forgetting about this place that is smack dab in the middle of Park Rd Shopping Center.  Normally I go in & out, but this is a great reason to stay a bit longer at the recently (and still under) renovated complex.  I read somewhere that the goal of the developer is to keep people there for a few hours when they come visit - this place will definitely make that happen.

I showed up at 8:30 and luckily they were still open (they normally close at 8), we were the last two customers.  I saw blueberry on the menu and asked for a taste.  AMAZING.  The blueberries are fresh & local from Bush-n-Vine in York, SC.

There are a few benches outside where you can sit and enjoy the gelato - while I was sitting, I had to google gelato to understand how food can taste so amazing."}
{"text":"Best gelato I have had hands down. Employees are nice, knowledgable and more than willing to answer any questions. Got the cannoli flavor and daym!  If your even thinking about it, try them out. Delicious."}
{"text":"I would give them 6 stars . . . but . . . I ding them down to 5 because the gelato disappears too quickly. So good.  Each time I eat here I feel transported to Taromina, Sicily wandering its crowded streets at the foot of Mt Aetna  Yes, they are pricey but it's cheaper than hoping a plane.  This is a summer no-brainer."}
{"text":"so amazing. i love love love this place and its always consistent. the owners are as kind as can be and always remember our names and my children's names. my only 'beef' is that the containers aren't larger its that good."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time yesterday and I am SO glad I did! 

Loved the Stracciatela and Blood Orange. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy Va Da Vie has opened in Park Road Shopping Center! I work in the shopping center so have already tried it quite a few times and LOVE IT!!! The lemon ricotta gelato is soooo good. And it's the lowest calorie offering, since I'm trying to lose weight. Just a small serving is perfect to satisfy that desire for something cold and sweet on these hot days. You've gotta try it. It's way better than frozen yoghurt or even ice cream."}
{"text":"The owners are the sweetest! A quaint location and space. The gelato is so fresh and creamy. I wish the portions weren't so small because I want more!!! I will definitely will be back for more when I come to Charlotte again."}
{"text":"What are you waiting for?! Fantastic new addition to the Park Road Shopping Center. It is smack dab in the middle of the shopping center surrounded by mid-century seating and great landscaping.

The owner and his passion for making fresh, local ingredient filled gelato is what won me over...well, and the deliciously flavored gelato! He makes it daily. They use environmentally friendly plastic spoons too. Bonus.

I could have eaten every flavor! The vanilla was fantastic, the mango was so creamy (even though no milk is used in the fruity flavors), and the pineapple was scrumptious! Oh, and the almond...Mmmmm! You see?! Gotta get you some.

This is my new favorite dessert stop, perfectly timed for summer!"}
{"text":"The ABSOLUTE best I have EVER tasted. Love the watermelon. And the owners are truly authentic about the gelato!"}
{"text":"Best gelato I have ever had. The place was spectacular and the quality and taste were to die for."}
{"text":"Visited today with my children (4 and 6). While the gelato is certainly delicious, the service is rude and unwelcoming. As others have noted they prefer not to give samples which is difficult with children and unusual flavors. In addition, the gentlemen ridiculed my daughter for not being able to read their 1 sample sign. 

While we live close by and I personally enjoy their gelato, part of getting ice cream is the pleasant \"treat\" experience which their service totally ruins.  I won't be returning and recommend others choose alternatives that appreciate their customers."}
{"text":"10 Stars out of 5!

Ok so I've sung the praises about John and Wendy's incredibly awesome creamy gelato flavors. Now I'm moving onto their sorbets. Guess what? SAME STORY! AWESOME GOODNESS! 

I tried all 4 of their fruit sorbets. Watermelon? Great. Was afraid to try the cantaloupe since I'm not a huge fan of that fruit. But OMG was it great! John said it's not the store bought variety. There's a local farmer who grows this \"sugar square\" variety and it is SOOOO good! Who would have thunk?

Then there's the fresh lemon with lemon pieces in it and it is SO refreshing.....like frozen lemonaide!

My fave though is their blueberry which is almost black/purple in color. It is oh so good.

The amazing thing is that John and Wendy pay so much attention to quality that it comes out in the flavors: perfect balance of sweetness, fruit flavors, creaminess and overall texture.

So again....a HUGE SHOUT OUT TO JOHN AND WENDY for opening up this phenomenal busiess for all of us to enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is my first visit to Va Da Vie. Never tried any of their gelato. Was lunching and shopping with a friend. As we entered, there were two staff at the counter. One staff member was tending to a customer and her kids. The owner came out and said we would have to wait. What happened to the second staff? She just stood there. Was she not able to serve us. I was holding my phone and a woman came out and said \"No pictures of the staff\"? WTF??? Why would I take picture of your staff? I didn't even check in yet. What is wrong with the picture? So we waited for the family to be finished with being served. Three staff people there and no one could handle the next customers. Guess only one girl was working. Was not happy with this experience. Gelato was nothing to rave about. It's just gelato."}
{"text":"We just got back from Italy and we were craving gelato. They did not disappoint, we LOVED the gelato here. The BIG downside: they close at 8pm. I won't plan on going back since I typically want gelato after dinner or a movie which is always after 8pm. They should consider staying open later in the summer...even 9pm would be better."}
{"text":"Wowoweewah.  Did I just step into a side street in Venice?  I am seriously questioning my judgement on ice cream for the past few years.  I am upset that I haven't been here until now.

Think tcby for adults, with handmade flavors such as lemon ricotta, coconut, chocolate hazelnut, strawberry stracciatella.  This is a class act gelato shoppe.  It's romantic, well done and most importantly, DELICIOUS.

A++++"}
{"text":"Owners are friendly and super knowledgeable about their craft and ingredients. Even with the weather being cold lately this is delicious place to stop."}
{"text":"I have heard about this place for years but every time I go they were closed.

After finally going over and getting there I must say, it is a very unique experience.

The first thing you notice is that it is a very clean store.

The customer service is excellent I was greeted it before I could even say hello.

They gave a description of every flavor.

I chose a honey avocado orange and a blood orange sorbet per the recommendation of the servers.

Very reasonably price for the flavor and atmosphere.

I would highly recommend coming just for the food alone but enjoy the entire experience."}
{"text":"Came by here for some after dinner gelato and was totally blown away. The shop is adorable, located in the middle of the shopping plaza, literally in the middle of the parking lot. It has cozy interior decor, very clean and modern. They have several flavor options that I imagine change seasonally. The gentlemen I assume was the owner was there serving at the counter. He explained in detail how they made each flavor and it was obvious that he was very passionate about what he did. They put great detail in to each flavor option and use real products to extract the best flavors. 
There are several size options available but the best deal is by far the regular because it comes with 2 flavors for only $5! Between myself and my husband we had the vanilla bean, chocolate, cinnamon and coffee bean. They were all absolutely incredible but the cinnamon was by far the favorite for both of us. I hope they have it year round because we will def. be going back!"}
{"text":"A measure of great ice cream or gelato is how well they do vanilla. Imported Madagascar & Tahitian vanilla beans in a thick creamy gelato was incredible!!  They only use fresh ingredients, no filler, all thriller! It's a luxurious dessert experience - visit this place now!!"}
{"text":"The gelato was fabulous!!  Loved talking to the owners while we selected our flavors.  :)"}
{"text":"Great place! Uses local cream and all fresh ingredients. Definitely worth the time. So glad to have them in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian Gelato has come to Charlotte!  Truly the best gelato I have tasted this side of Rome...Molto Delizioso !!"}
{"text":"There's not much to say that hasn't already been said. They use fresh, quality ingredients, make their gelato and sorbets on site, and care about what they do and how they do it. From the hand scraping of each and every vanilla bean to their *spotless* establishment & unrivaled customer service, you can count on Va De Vie Gelato becoming a Charlotte staple for years to come.

PS...The Lemon Ricotta deserves an award!"}
{"text":"We took a mini vacation to Charlotte for the long weekend and found this gelato shop. I got the regular size with chocolate and hazelnut and my husband got the pistachio and coffee. Mine was awesome and I devoured it. My husband liked his too but the pistachio could have been better, he loved the coffee though. A really cute gelato shop with indoor and outdoor seating. Maybe they could extend the hours for Fri and Sat since 8 is a little early to close when u offer dessert."}
{"text":"Too Many Rules!  Listen to me!  I think the Rules are the, The  THE   ENTERTAINMENT.... Hey POPROCK LOVE, I do not mind all these Rules because, Because, BECAUSE Be Cause B cause...  Because of the Wunderful things he does, YES!  Delicious!  Delicious and Unique!  Unique in Flavor Profiles, so TRUE and Natural... No Cell Phone use inside of any kind Please!

Delicious and CUTE!  I can spell Cute!  Cute and Cool!  Architectural Design of this stand-alone Shop, standing alone in the Middle (or close) of the Historic Park Road Shopping Center, fits!!!  It looks as if it could have been here as long as the Shopping Center, yet as new as it looks you get the Romantic Adventurous Idea of Detail that someone (or a team of someones) had the Perfekt Vision to build a place where I could fall in LOVE at least twice before 5:OO PM... Thank You... This place looks Great on the Inside too!  Finally a spot I have no suggestions for how they could look any better!!!

We consumed about six flavors though these four are the ones I remember (hopefully I add the others and more until I have eaten them all) ::

Pear
Cannoli
Avocado
Ricotta Lemon
Bacio
Stracciatella 
Pistachio 


Only ONE Sample Please!
Since all the Flavors were Delicious, this rule did not bother me, and Save Your spoon can be viewed as Environmentally Conscience (did I say that right?) as not printing a receipt is as well...Though if you would like a receipt you may ask for one

Service 
Did you see that movie last October called \"The Accountant\" ? I'm recommending it!  I believe if I lived here (again) I would eat here as much as I have eaten at Escazu (no even more) and that much exposure to me, CAN have a Beneficially Changing and lasting Effect on a LOT of people (I said CAN)...  I canNOT wait to comeback with my MaleFriennnnnnd!  I hope also that one day in some way my eBay Bride gets to experience it, though my doubts are that she would ever write about it! 

Size Does Matter After all
Small
I LOVE small !  Intimate and Cozy has a HUGE spot in my Heart, its the Romance of a small unique shop and a Perfekt Product!  You really don't know!!!

La Maschine
I LOVE Machines and this one is Very Interesting... Spinning the FRESH Gelato while I Gaulk in awe"}
{"text":"Always fresh, delicious and authentic. This is probably the best gelato I've had outside of Italy. It hits the spot on a summer evening especially after a walk on the greenway. The only problem with this place is trying to decide which flavors to get! The cannoli and lemon ricotta are my favorites because they're unique but the bacio (which tastes like Nutella but better) and stracitella (chocolate chip) are also classics. They have good non-dairy sorbet as well that are often seasonal and local. Get there! 

Note they're closed on Mondays and close at 8 pm on other nights."}
{"text":"I really love gelato and its hard to find good authentic gelato. This place does a great job and the only reason I did not give them 5 stars is because I usually don't like all of their options of flavors. The salted chocolate chip was decent but my only option that visit. I also got the chocolate and banana. The banana was made with real bananas and you could taste the freshness. I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Was back to this place and I was once again impressed with the awesome gelato I had 3 flavors all wonderful but talked to the owner and his passion for quality and willingness to share his info about his ingredients is equally impressive can't say enough good things about this place"}
{"text":"The couple that owns this place is passionate about gelato and it comes out in the top notch quality of their products. Lemon ricotta, strawberry, blood orange, and stracciatella are my faves."}
{"text":"Best Gelato in Charlotte hands down!  You must try this place!  Great retro look, wonderful owners and awesome flavors.  Their Creamy Almond is to die for!  Yummy sorbets too!!!!  Check them out!!!"}
{"text":"Usually I am a huge fan of small business and local places to eat. When I stumbled upon Va Da Vie I was more than exited to try some gelato....Although when i came in and thought I was going to be greeted with a smile on the face, however, I was greeted with a rather harsh lady...maybe the onwer. She was quick and very rude. The gelato was expensive and they had way too many rules. I wonder how long they will stay open with this type of customer service... I will definetley not recommend my friends for this place."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time with this place unless you really wanna spend your money on overpriced costs for not very much portion. The gelato is OK at best. Maybe I'm biased though because the service was beyond awful. The owner is rude, rambles on about the ingredients. EXTREMELY stingy. Don't even think about asking for a sample. The owner was extremely short with me after I asked to try a flavor. 

After reading everyone else's reviews I'm realizing I'm not the only one who has had this experience. These people should read their own reviews because MAYBE they'd change how they treated their customers.....Being nice to your clients doesn't cost a damn thing.

Do yourself a solid and just go to Ben and Jerrys across the street. They won't be a dick if you ask to try a sample."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS flavors. And quality ingredients you can taste. Unlike other reviews, they were generous with allowing several different samples of their gelato. New favorite find."}
{"text":"Excellent gelato!  I just returned from Italy and accidentally stumbled upon Va Da Vie in the parking lot on my way into Blackhawk Hardware.  The owners are so nice and let me try many flavors before I settled on a scoop of coffee and one of almond.  Both are amazing. Closest to Italy I've found anywhere around here.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Delizioso! OMG, it was decadent and so flavorful. I had the coffee bean and lemon ricotta which I though might be to rich or cheesy but not at all the case. It lemon complimented the ricotta so well and it was a refreshing treat on a beautiful Sunday evening. The coffee was equally good almost like an espresso gelato but not quite as strong even though it had coffee bits in it. Well worth it!"}
{"text":"I have a thing for frozen treats... ice cream, soft serve, fro yo, frozen custard... bring it on! Gelato holds a special spot in my tummy... It's one of my fave frozen treats. Charlotte now has a legit gelato place in a great location. This cute little gelato shop popped up in the middle of Park Road Shopping Center. 

Like most gelato shops they had a variety of flavors made with locally sourced ingredients. They had about 8 flavors ranging from the requisite vanilla and chocolate to fresh cantaloupe sorbetto and lemon ricotta. Make sure to sample a few! Every flavor I tried was good. I recommend getting the medium size ($5) which allows you to get up to two flavors! I decided on chocolate and stracciatella. Fantastic combo!

The store was aesthetically pleasing. White building, nicely decorated interior, but the thing I didn't like was how the gelato was presented. I'm used to gelato shops creating elaborate displays of their gelato. I usually pick it based on how good it looks in the tray (yeah, yeah... how vain of me... lol). I couldn't actually see any of the gelato until it was scooped out of the container. I guess it's just different from every other gelato shop I've been to. 

The other minor annoyance... Va Da Vie closes so early! (Hours Tues-Sun 11:30am to 8pm) While I really enjoyed their gelato, I usually want frozen treats after dinner on a Friday or Saturday... well after Va Da Vie closes. 

As many other Yelpers have stated, this is a stand alone building and not a store front in the shopping center.

Overall, I'd recommend checking them out. I'll be back to check out more flavors but not as often as I would like simply because of their hours."}
{"text":"My dad, aunt, and daughter loved it. My daughter had the sweet cream and they had the chocolate hazelnut. The owners and crew need to learn customer service. \"One sample only\" sign rubbed me the wrong way. My dad asked their address to confirm the Facebook post and they were weary about giving it. Hopefully they never have an emergency because the address is the first thing 911 asks. I won't go back."}
{"text":"A little pricier than regular ice cream but completely worth it, get the lemon ricotta and the hazelnut it do die for."}
{"text":"This place has amazing gelato and terrible hours. It's the dead of summer and it closes at 8pm. Tons of restaurants and eateries around to have dinner and enjoy a gelato after, but who gets done with dinner on a Friday by 8pm? I'm not coming at lunch or before dinner, so who gets to actually enjoy this summer treat?"}
{"text":"Real Italian gelato in the heart of Park Road Shopping Center! 

The gelato here transports me back to the streets of Rome. They use only the best of the best ingredients and it is obvious because you can taste it in their gelatos. 

I really like the straccitella which is Italy's version of chocolate chip. Lemon ricotta is amazing too! 

The size of the cup is pretty small. But gelato is rich so the size doesn't bother me. 

The shop is very small and there is a little bit of seating outside. There is plenty of parking all around the shop as it sits in the middle of the Park Road Shopping Center parking lot. 

Note: you can only select 1-2 gelatos to sample. So choose carefully and read reviews to help steer you!

Can't wait to try other flavors."}
{"text":"Something about this place didn't sit well with me. Although they have great reviews I immediately found their flaw. GREED! Very greedy! It's evident from the sign they have above their gelato that reads, \"Please, 1 sample only.\" How pathetic is that! 

 I've never ever seen ANY ice cream place or gelato place that put restrictions and limits on paying customers wanting to sample different flavors. Which by the way is the smallest sample I've seen. The owner of this place is definitely a \"portion nazi\" and his employees look TERRIFIED when serving gelato afraid of possibly serving the customer \"too much.\" 

Their small cup looks like an infants cup and if you pay attention the cup has a nice gap on the bottom making your serving even smaller than you think. The poor girls took their sweet time making sure they did not give us any extra gelato and made sure to smooth out any excess gelato from the baby cup. 

 A greedy owner is the worst kind and he definitely won't see my money again. Their gelato isn't bad, but their shady tactics are."}
{"text":"The owners were very nice and informative! I had the vanilla bean and pineapple combined, and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious, but pricy.  Small cup is $4.60, and it's even smaller than it looks as there is a false bottom on the cup so that it appears you have more than you do, but I'll go back."}
{"text":"I'm usually not a gelato fan. It tastes like fake ice cream to me. But this... this is the best gelato I've ever tasted in my life, and I'm Queen Picky. You can taste how fresh it is. Lemon ricotta and honey avocado orange, two flavors I would NEVER pick, but decided to try, my life has never been the same. I crave them. OMG they're everything. WONDERFUL. This is the place to sample something completely out of your comfort zone and not regret it. Bravo."}
{"text":"One of the best places for gelato in Charlotte!  I love that they import most of their ingredients from Italy, and even have local ingredients as well.  They also have seasonal flavors which is always pleasant.  Service is superb too! Highly recommend the lemon ricotta and the baccio!"}
{"text":"The best gelato you'll ever eat!!! The owner is fantastic to talk to as well. Such passion!!!"}
{"text":"As fans of small business in general, and as a local business owner myself, my wife and I could not wait for Va Da Vie to open. The fact that they were setting up inside the Park Road Shopping Center, a favorite area of ours since we are only 1 mile up the road, was just a huge plus. For the past 8 weeks I have made it my mission to introduce everyone in my office to VaDaVie and even have made sure to make a stop for gelato a must when relatives have been in town. Usually I can count on the smiling face and warm greeting from the male owner which has more than made up for the cold shoulder you get from the female owner who is always there. 

Tonights experience turned the usual cold shoulder and kicked it up a few notches as my wife walked in past 8:00pm (8:12pm to be exact) as the door was still open and there were still people in line ordering and two women sitting enjoying their gelato inside; just what a new small business would like right?! Instead she received a very snarky \"I better lock the door or else people will just keep coming in\" from the female owner followed by the comment \"well I'm not going to turn you away now\" after my wife asked if she should leave. WOW!, what a reception to give when you are trying to start up a small business! What a problem to have, people lining out the door to buy some of your product and they are greeted with this poor attitude?!

Great gelato but will not return based on the principle. From one small business owner to another; this is not the way to build a successful business."}
{"text":"Smooth and creamy gelato. A lot of different flavors you won't find anywhere else. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"They say that the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. In my case, gelato is the secret weapon. Not just any gelato, however. The gelato should be made in the traditional fashion with fresh dairy, locally-sourced ingredients, and a little bit of love. 

I've been looking for a place in Charlotte that makes gelato like this and now I've found it. Va Da Vie makes some of the best gelato that I've ever had. I started with a traditional pairing:  bacio and stracciatella. The bacio is perfectly made with Italian hazelnuts and creamy milk chocolate. The sublime stracciatella is made with local dairy and rich dark chocolate. I could eat this pairing every day. 

I also tried several other flavors including coffee bean, chocolate, and banana. The coffee bean stood out for its flavor. The beans seemed to pop on to your tongue. The banana tasted like the bananas were picked off the tree this morning. And the chocolate? Well, it's chocolate and it was pretty darned good, too. 

If you're a lover of gelato, make your way over to Va Da Vie and fall in love again."}
{"text":"Delicious gelato is at your finger tips!  When shopping at the Park Road Shopping Center - pop in here for a little treat.  Very small storefront and ordering was a little confusing when we were there.  Folks were just milling around and we were't sure where the line was or what to do first.  Finally we figured it out tho and I had the pistachio which was DIVINE!  There is no seating inside for now - only outside which is fine with me.  Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I love the fresh ingredients they use. You can tell the owner cares and lives what he does. We will be back alot. I just wish they were open later in the summer time."}
{"text":"Va Da Vie gets major props for their inventiveness.  I've never seen a gelato menu more eclectic than the one here!  This is definitely a good thing, people.  It's time to stop being so Vanilla and start being more Honey Avocado!

Their Stracciatella (sp) was pretty good and their chocolate was pretty awesome.  It was hard trying to make up my mind, so I'll just have to come back sometime for their Lemon Ricotta and Cannoli flavors!  Overall, this place gets mad props for their inventive flavors.  Yes, it's more expensive, but you're getting more than just chocolate or vanilla as a base.  If you don't like weird flavors (and I mean that in a good way!), this is not the place for you.

Great place to stop in for a weekend treat!  FYI-they don't stay open late, so plan this as an afternoon/early evening snack."}
{"text":"Stellar locally sourced ingredients plus high-quality ingredients from far away places when needed to finish this frozen work of art  they call gelato. No bright colors , artificial colors needed here. Very nice humble owners with a passion one can taste. I got goosebumps trying the pistachio! In the old H2Oasis building in the middle of the parking lot."}
{"text":"The place is super cute and very clean! Their gelato taste great, high quality and made with local ingredients. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Va Da Vie + Spoon = Heaven

Lost Yelper: \"I see the Park Road Shopping Center Sign, but I don't see you.\"

7:55 PM - Posted closing time 8:00 PM - tick tock, tick tock

Slight Panic

Helpful employee: \"We're in the middle of the parking lot.\"

Head turns 45 degrees to the left - AHA!!!

Whew, made it - 8:03 but everyone is still smiling and serving ice cream - what gives?

Va Da Vie is family owned and operated, so they run on \"happy customer\" time. Nice!
Beautiful little shop filled with cold shiny cylinders of incredible gelato. Taste one, or taste them all; they will let you!
 
All their gelato is made from premium ingredients including fresh milk and cream from local NC dairies. Strawberry, Blood Orange and Cannoli, all great!! Chocolate Hazelnut (aka Baccio)= stratospherically good! Stracciatella = interplanetary great!

Dear Family - please cryogenically freeze my body in large silver tube packed with Stracciatella gelato - that is all. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Amazing little shop. The gelato is freshly made using the freshest products and it is the cleanest place I've ever been in. The gelato is amazing and worth every penny. The owners went to school to learn the technique and obviously they were great students!
The lemon ricotta was very refreshing and I paired it with the luscious strawberry that was the best I've ever had. My husband raved abt the pistachio which is actually made from a pistachio paste that comes from Italy. The nice and sweet owners, their super clean locale and the adorableness of being a stand alone shop in a strip mall makes it outstanding!!"}
{"text":"We have chosen this place to celebrate the National Ice Cream day and we were not disappointed! I have been in Italy quite a few times and the second thing I do whenever I land there is get a REAL gelato (first thing is getting a REAL espresso). 

This is the best gelato you can get in Charlotte but not quite the same as the real Italian gelato though. However, I can truly say this gelato gets very close to the real thing. The machine is imported from Italy but they do not use truly Italian ingredients but from local farmers, which is still great and the ice cream is really tasty.

The ice cream shop is in the middle of a parking lot which is kind of unusual but at the same time it is a really nicely decorated place with tons of parking around even during busy times. There are not a lot of seating inside though, place is small.

Price is not high as some people complain here... prices are about right. Some people want cheap good ice cream, that's not going to exist."}
{"text":"Finally! Charlotte gets the gelato it deserves. And in a great location in the Park Road shopping center where you can get some after a movie or whatever. I had the lemon ricotta. A small cup is all you need and it is perfect and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Looking for a tiny sweet treat after having a meal in and around the Park Road corridor?  How about some creamy gelato made in small batches from a husband and wife team who went all-in to perfect their recipes and hone their craft.  

The product line is simple but that's no dig against them, since it allows for a singular-focus.  House-made gelato in a small range of flavors that are both seasonal and classic. Sample thru one or many until you are sure of the right flavor or combo for you.  Do ask the staff (usually the owners) about the ingredients that went into them- the focus on quality begins at the base ingredients used. Italian pistachios with a uniquely strong flavor, for example, are just one of the many very tasty possibilities here. Seasonal sorbets are also typically not to be missed.  Pick a cup size and that determines how many flavor you can combine into a single order.  

Just be ready to take your order outside, or to go.  They have a few seats, both indoor and out door, but this tiny outpost is smack dab in the middle of the parking lot.  Also note their hours- late night diners will have to wait, these guys do not stay open for the after-dark hours.  However, this is a treat worth working into your dinner (or lunch) plans or for just a quick snack in-between."}
{"text":"I rarely give out five stars on a first visit, but this small business absolutely deserves it. Talked to the owner, and the passion and care for what he and his wife are doing, not only inspire but pushed a solid four star into a five star. An island in the center of park road shopping center, called us like a beacon. A spotless store an inviting, generous owner and amazing gelato makes you wanna camp out here. Please support this small local business."}
{"text":"Very nice experience. Good gelato BUT small portions for top prices. Also, a must is homemade cones, they only offer cups. I sense it's a new business and I'm hopeful that those changes will be made. Also, they need more outside seating."}
{"text":"Delicious gelato! My husband and I shared the cantaloupe sorbetto and the hazelnut chocolate gelato. Both were really good! Great addition to Park Road Shopping Center!"}
{"text":"This place is simply wonderful. The flavors are unique and delicious and very high quality. You can tell the owner is very passionate about gelato because he always gives background on the flavors, schedules and ingredients. Today I was recommended the pear to side with my chai spice. It was so good I had to post."}
{"text":"So I checked out this gelato due to the yelp reviews. While I will say that the quality is good. I truly enjoyed the pistachio, and bacio. The prices are truly are on the high side. The picture that were taken by reviewers in 2014 shows a different size portion than what is given present day. The scoop the ice cream and it literally does not go higher than the rim of the cup. Also, the cup gives the illusion that there is more gelato in there. Because the bottom of the cup is actually 1/3 higher than the bottom edge of the cup. The largest portion with tax is $ 6.50 and that equivocates to 2/3 cup of gelato for what you pay for. Do not get me wrong, I think they do put premium quality ingredients. But for $13 for what they consider two large portions, I would rather spend that on premium desserts in a restaurant setting."}
{"text":"Very high quality, fresh gelato... just a little pricey. The smallest size with one flavor is about $5. The stracciatella is a great go-to and it's basically the Italian version of chocolate chip. They also have sorbets such as blood orange and Bartlett pear. The bacio is a chocolate hazelnut which is also awesome. The last time I went I got the cannoli flavor and it was super complex and light. It had bits of orange peel and pistachio in it. Definitely worth a visit for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I swung into Va Da Vie one Sunday after brunch at Cantina (\"No thank you, kind waiter, I have no room for your dessert because I'm stuffing my face with gelato when I leave here\"). I'd been eye-balling this place since it opened and my only regret, now that I've finally tried it, is that I waited so long. 

The product: house made gelato that is cool, and creamy, and delicious. Not sure if you'll actually like a particular flavor? No problem, they give samples! The staff, who, if I recall correctly, were also the owners/ master-minds behind each flavor, were super nice. They seemed to have a genuine passion for what they did. They were eager to discuss the flavor options, and the ingredients that went into them. Most importantly, they didn't grow suspicious when I'd asked for my 10th sample (don't worry - I did actually buy some!). 

The building is a tiny little thing, smack dab in the middle of the Park Road Shopping Center. They have a few seats, both indoor and out door, and with it being in the shopping center, parking is plentiful. With flavors that rotate to match the season, Va Da Vie is a place that I will surely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Ergh.  Another 3.5 - better than other gelato I've tried in Charlotte.  Not just sugary mix-based, like most. I really like the cannoli and the chocolate. I've tried others I do not love... lemon not lemony. Coffee odd. Almond not almondy. 

I love family businesses but service can be awkward. Owner seems knowledgeable. 

Potential! I'd love to see more flavors, stronger flavors, lower prices. Berries? Chestnut? Ahh I've been spoiled in Rome. (An old place near The Spanish Steps makes me cry.) And seen an explosion of generic   low-quality gelato spots in NYC and even Europe. 

They seem to use local ingredients here . Yay! Organic?? I hope pesticide free. 

Good luck... better than Whole Food gelato. Hope to see improvement."}
{"text":"Always delicious!! Pistachio is my favorite. Owners are very nice and take lots of pride in their work. I'd eat there everyday if my wallet and waistline allowed"}
{"text":"WOWWWWWWWWWW.....This place is amazing -- It has to be the best gelato in town!! If there is ever a day that I leave the Charlotte area, I will miss this place dearly. I've had gelato all over NYC and this place tops it!

This place was recommended to me by my friend Paul and oh boy did it live up to the expectations. The staff here is super friendly and they actually encourage you to sample. I tried 5 different flavors and they we all delicious (coffee bean, vanilla bean, hazelnut, stracciatella, lemon ricotta). I ended up getting a medium size cup with hazelnut and stracciatella and it was just absolutely AMAZING. The store is small but there's seating outside as well - it's also spotless, you can find a spec of dirt anywhere. 

I haven't tried gelato anywhere else in town as I just moved to area, but I'm confident in saying that this is one of the best, if not THE best gelato spots in town."}
{"text":"Will never be back here again. Was a regular customer, then was told we couldn't sit in their outside seating because we had to-go food with us, after we just bought gelato from them?!?? There was one other customer there too. If anything they could use customers sitting there to make it appear like it's not some random building in the middle of a parking lot. They've also become so stingy, one sample only lol. We get it, you're a boutique fine gelato shop and make everything in house. But the dude acts like he's dropping the hope diamond in a cup.

Hope you don't lose more good loyal customer because of you're short sided attitude and self skewed image."}
{"text":"A bit on the pricy side but it does not disappoint. The flavors rotate which is great if you like trying new flavors but not so great if you find one you love and it goes away.

The cannoli with pistachio is great. I love the crunch the pistachio adds. The Pistachio is also great. Almost wish they added chocolate pieces for that crunch.  Not sure you noticed the theme but I really like pistachio and crunch."}
{"text":"Having visited the week they opened 3 years ago and chatting with the lovely owners, I am so happy this place has stayed around! Understandably so! The gelato is amazing!! I no longer live around the corner, but if I did, I would surely be a regular. 

This past week, I tried the pear sorbetto (though I'm normally not a fruity dessert lover), and it was perfection. Worth the $4.25 price for a small cup. (The large is the best value if you're willing to share. I couldn't eat that much.) 

The only negative is that they close by 8. When we did live nearby, we always wanted to go before our late movie."}
{"text":"Please understand - when you taste these one of a kind carefully selected flavors that this is the labor of an artist & craftsman  - this is NOT a Dairy Queen franchise. Get there before 8pm or you won't get to experience one of the true gems of this great city. They begin work for the next day at 8:01 pm. 

Blood Orange, Pear - OMG.... Understand that this craft is beyond what you think you know & that you are blessed when you taste hand ground vanilla from a far that has found pure bliss in your mouth on a bench in the middle of Park Road Shopping Center

{"text":"Best gelato EVER! The space is lovely and so are the owners! 
Great addition to the area.
My recommendation: Hazelnut and Vanilla Bean. It will change your life!"}
{"text":"I like gelato and my husband adores it. So as you might imagine, we frequent gelato shops around the world, including major cities and tiny towns in the US, Europe, and in particular Italy. I won't lie: they do a decent job here. If their practices are as locally committed as they say they are, then combine that with an array of traditional and fruity fusion flavors and you've got Va Da Vie's brand. Oh-wait. Except I forgot how bad things taste when you have had a horrible customer experience. Like many on here, we were just appalled by how we and other customers were treated by the owner, the owner's wife, and the two terrified and miserable looking young girls trying to serve patrons. 

The good: hazelnuts were generally finely chopped, the fruit flavors were obviously fresh and incredibly fruity. 

The bad: there are nine flavors, including some odd but potentially interesting combo-fusion flavors (avocado-something-honey) but you can only have one sample. I promise you, even in the best gelato places there can sometimes be a flavor that doesn't agree with you. It is important to figure that out before you buy a cup of it or contaminate other flavors with it by ordering it in a multi-flavor cup. I have once seen a sign like this in San Fran which says: if the line is out the door, we may limit customers to one sample. It is in small print and really just put up so the staff can point to it when the shop gets crazy, but they have the option to enforce or not based on how the line is moving, whether the customers are actually there to buy or just spoon shop, etc. The sign in this Charlotte venue is bigger than their pricing and prominently displayed. 

The ugly: there is only one size available. It's about a small Dixie cup's worth. You know, the kind you get at the dentist office to gargle the mouthwash? That's about $5. For a buck more, you get two flavors in the cup rather than just one. They called it a large but it's the same size. They put the gelato in the cup so carefully because they're not allowed to let it be taller than the cup. They literally scoop it off and put it back in the container if it is. And they had to warn the family in front of us that the cups are top heavy and might tip. That is code for: our cups are full of air on the bottom... Yes, I have worked in an ice cream shop myself and know exactly how that happens. 

The horrendous: The young servers are terrified of the owners and keep glancing back over their shoulders to make sure they owners aren't going to come out of the back and yell at them (which they did while we were present). The owners also came out and watched the girls serve customers but didn't help at all, which was incredibly uncomfortable for all of us. At one point, the owner came out and yelled at a family for taking pictures of their child, saying no photos allowed in the building. The photo was obviously of the kid, who was knee high and standing on the floor, not anywhere near the gelato or machinery or signage or ingredients. My friend (who is a HUGE sucker for desserts-the plan was to hit up three different desert spots that day...we did four...) actually walked out because of this incident. After having waited but having already asked for a sample, I was too embarrassed (and admittedly a little terrified of being yelled at) to leave, so I stayed and ordered. But I won't be back. Chick-fil-a soft serve with a smile tasted better than my gourmet dish with that horrible experience."}
{"text":"Oh, Va Da Vie, how I love thee. Let me count the ways...

1. Pumpkin gelato
2. Cannoli gelato
3. Moreno cherry gelato 
4. Lemon ricotta gelato 
5. Blood orange sorbet
6. Pear sorbet
7. Pistachio gelato
8. Honey avacado orange gelato 

I think you get my point. Best gelato in North Carolina, hands down. Maybe best in the US. 

And the guy that runs the shop is one of the most adorable human beings I've ever met!"}
{"text":"Literally so good!! Everything is made in house, imported both from Italy as well as using local produce. The only complaint I have is their assembly line technique. .with four servers, somehow they only serve one customer at a time. It's very strange - doesn't seem to be the best way of doing things, especially when there is a long line of customers."}
{"text":"So, I kind of hate to be the only one giving a modest review but I am particular about great service; that is usually why I try to patronize local businesses when possible. The Good:  I had seen the write up in the paper and I was so excited to try this cute new gelato place. I love the fact that they use local ingredients and I thought the gelato was very good.  It wasn't the best I have ever had, but it was well done with bright flavor and consistency.  The prices are typical for the area; I purchased a large so that I could try 3 flavors and it was $6.50 including tax.  

The Bad: So, the owner was the one taking the orders on a Saturday night and he was trying to move the line along, which was fine.  I was the last person in line and I chose 2 flavors and asked him about his preference between vanilla and almond.  He just recited the ingredients and I selected vanilla.  I then tried to engage him about his product and mentioned the article in the paper and he just completely ignored me to give my cup to the girl at the counter who bluntly asked, \"What did you want?\"  She put the flavors in and couldn't be bothered to wipe the cup, which had gelato all over it, handed it back to the owner, who placed it on the counter in front of me as I paid, melting gelato running down the sides of the cup.  So, a good product, with poor presentation and mediocre to poor service.  It may not be \"sourced locally\" but at least the kids working in Sweet Frog are excited about their product and really do a great job with service.  Sadly,  I probably won't return."}
{"text":"Best gelato I've ever tasted! The owners were very friendly and helpful! I got the chocolate chip flavor (stracciatella) and it was delicious! This place is a must when visiting Charlotte! We will definitely be back just for the gelato"}
{"text":"First time here and first thing I noticed that the place was sparkly clean. It's a nice little place with good amount of seating space on the outside. We were a group of 3 and all of us ordered a Regular since you get to try 2 flavors. Flavors I really like liked were Stracciatella, Coffe, Chocolate and the best was Pistachio - a must must try! Also the good part is that it is open even on weekends (Sunday particularly) till 8 PM. Will definitely stop by again to try some more flavors."}
{"text":"This place is cool and brand new - my crew loves the fresh gelato in all the flavors.  Nothing negative comes to mind.  Beautiful space!  Friendly/sweet/helpful staff."}
{"text":"There's no question they have great gelato. We tried the pistachio, chocolate, and the stracciatella with chocolate bits.  All were rich, creamy, and full of flavor - everything you want in a good gelato. Serving sizes are typically smaller at gelato shops but these did seem very small for the price.  For those interested in gelato it's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"John & Wendy truly focus on quality ingredients.  I was ecstatic to find this amazing gelato but even more thrilled to find out they had only been open a week at that time.  This review has been sitting unfinished all Summer.  I hope you have had a chance to try it and if not run there now!  After living in Italy, I can tell you that this is the real deal.  We even got to try the gelato as John was making it in the Effe machine.  Effe machine + amazing ingredients + a killer recipe = REAL GELATO!  

They locally source as much as they can, milk from a local dairy farm, local fruit, etc.  Most importantly, the pistachios come from Sicily (only the best in the world).

My favorite flavors were lemon ricotta, pistachio & baccio.  And for the love of Italy, learn how to say them in perfect Italian form.

Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"A cute shack in the middle of a parking lot for a shopping plaza. My folks pointed it out on my first visit to Charlotte, but it was closed when we drove by. We made a mental point to try it the next visit, preferably when it was not the day after a major holiday. 

Fast forward to a few days prior to Easter, I stopped in during the early afternoon. There was one couple ahead of us trying and wrapping up their choices on flavors, which didn't take more than 2-3 minutes. 

The interior is clean and minimalist. The flavors are on the board overhead and they rotate out based on what is in season. What caught my attention was the large machine behind the counter - apparently this is a gelato machine imported from Italy that is used to make all of the gelato flavors in the shop. Every flavor is housed in a separate temperature controlled container - very reminiscent of Grom in Florence. (The latter taught me that gelato is an art form and each flavor freezes best at different temperatures to prevent anything from becoming too icy.)

The gals behind the counter were friendly and knowledgeable about the flavors. They shared information about the ingredients and where they are sourced, many of them are local. The owner was present and he thanked us for stopping in - it is clear to me that he is very passionate about the business and his craft.

Hazelnut was wonderful - smooth, nutty flavor without being too sweet. Pricing was very fair compared to other gelato places I've visited.

They offer at least 2 sorbet flavors on a regular basis for those who do not consume dairy, so there's something for everyone."}
{"text":"Awesome Gilato for a good price. Manager and employees were awesome! Fully explained the process and ingredients. Even sent an employee outside to watch our dogs while we ordered."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best gelato  you will ever have.

I love the straccitella and the cannoli.  The place is super clean, great service, and the product is amazing. 

You can sample one flavor if you want to as well.  

The portions are small, but the flavor is huge!  There are chairs and tables outside to enjoy your gelato and bar stools inside."}
{"text":"Amazing gelato - creamy, refreshing, and decadent! The lemon ricotta was out of control!!!!! The owners are super nice and let us sample several flavors. Beware, the small is reeaallllly small, and not cheap either. But I don't mind paying for a high quality product - definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Lovely, little place in a cool strip mall filled with neat businesses. Two medium sized portions were $10.82. My almond and bacio (hazelnut chocolate) was delish and filled with nuts. The almond tasted like almond butter but so much better; no extract here. Boyfriend had lemon gelato and sorbet, enjoyed both, finished his way faster than I finished mine. Clean, neat operation with pleasant employees."}
{"text":"Va Da Vie's Gelattos can be best described as a party on your tongue. Every flavor is made in house. We had a blood orange and a strawberry, another with Pistachio and lemon and a few other flavors. Even the vanilla is a stand out."}
{"text":"Really? Closed at 8:00 PM on weekends during the summer! I don't even start thinking about gelato until 8:30. Come on! You have a 4 star  Mexican restaurant, pizzas parlor, and movie theater  within stones throw. I give this business 6 months until it fails."}
{"text":"Life-changing gelato. Superb customer experience. The staff has clearly been trained exceptionally well; each time I go in I'm greeted so kindly and introduced to new flavors with great detail. Couldn't ask for a better experience or yummier gelato. This place is doing everything right!"}
{"text":"Made right in the back of the little store in the middle of Park Road Shopping, this is the best Gelato we've had since a visit to Florence, Italy 
We stop by whenever we are in the neighborhood and only wish they would expand to more locations"}
{"text":"BEST Gelati in Charlotte! The cannoli gelati is to die for. This is the only gelati I have had in the states that actually taste like Italian gelati"}
{"text":"I recommend you stop Va Da Vie Gelato and try their wonderful gelato. My favorite flavors are cannoli with pistachio, lemon ricotta and banana. The cannoli and lemon ricotta use the same local ricotta cheese!!! The owner is so nice and very knowledge about the gelato."}
{"text":"Va da Vie is a very small gelato place in a cool, old style shopping center in Charlotte.
The store is tiny, has small seating inside and outside and no restrooms. Which is a minus.

I felt like they were very stingy with the samples. We were for the first time in the store and we were trying to figure out what to get. We ended up getting 2 scoops, one Stracciatella, one Bacio, one bigger than the other (more Stracicatella, less Bacio). The gelato is OK, better than chain ice-creams, but not extraordinary. The price was a bit high for what you get, around $5.

I wasn't impressed with the customer service, either. Not particularly nice service, the lady that checked us out was kinda harsh."}
{"text":"Delicious! They had real homemade gelato made with real local organic ingredients. The staff was friendly and helpful. The shop was very clean and organized. Even the outdoor area was very clean. Prices are reasonable. I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed coming here for the gelato but I will not be returning again. Over the past year they have become extremely greedy. I don't know about most people but I want to try flavors before I buy an entire cup of it, an expensive cup at that. They now don't allow people to eat their gelato on their property if you have food from other places. This to me, doesn't make sense. I just bought gelato from your shop? There was also only ONE other customer there so they have either lost business due to their new \"rules\" or I hit a slow time. Either way I won't be returning. Good luck to you and your business."}
{"text":"Now that summer is almost over I honestly hope Vada Via has winter hours because I am addicted! I love all the fresh ingredients and that they use local farmers fruit. I adore every single flavor I have tried. So yummy! I cannot say enough good things."}
{"text":"This place should not be saved for hot days, it should be part of your diet everyday! The flavors are real and the process of making is artful. It is to savor."}
{"text":"What a wonderful local amazing gem. All fresh local fruits and nuts and milk from a local dairy. Absolutely must experience this, Delish!"}
{"text":"All of the ingredients are from Italy and you can tase the freshness. Only about 9 flavors but all were really good."}
{"text":"Va Da Vie -- oh, how I love thee! The gelato is incredibly delicious and full of flavor! I cannot say enough great things about this place - you won't be disappointed! Oh yah -- Dustin Hoffman's younger brother (the owner) is just as sweet as the gelato! ;)"}
{"text":"This place is great. Flavors change regularly but highly recommend the lemon ricotta or coffee flavored ones. All are made in-house using fresh and local (when possible) ingredients.

My only complaint is that it would be nice if it was open later than 8pm on weekends!"}
{"text":"I am not a huge gelato person, but I do enjoy Va Da Vie. My boyfriend loves this pace!! It's located in the center of Park Road Shopping Center in a small white building. There is plenty of parking and plenty of room to sit outside the gelato shop and enjoy your treat. 

The shop is family owned and operated, and the owners are attentive and friendly. They use quality ingredients and make killer gelato. My only complaint about this spot is the closing time - I believe they close at 8 pm which is early (in my opinion) for a dessert spot. I think they'd do great business even later in the evening."}
{"text":"Wow! This is hands down the best gelato in North Carolina. I would be giving this place 11 stars it weren't for the fact that they close at 8 p.m. I rarely eat ice cream/gelato before dinner, but I would be a regular if they stayed open until 10 or 11 p.m. I hope the owners will reconsider their hours and hire staff to help serve their customers with a late night sweet tooth, like myself."}
{"text":"Good quality gelato, but pricey for the portion.  It's a small place but they don't have a ton of variety compared to other gelato shops I've been to.  Lemon ricotta was remarkable"}
{"text":"If you like gelato this is the place to go! It is in a small building in the center of Park Rd Shopping plaza,  very unsuspecting little establishment. The gelato flavors are seasonal and made from the most authentic ingrediants. I ordered pistacio flavored gelato, as well as Cannoli flavor and chocolate hazelnut. The owner explained how he has ingredients flown in from all parts of the world (pistacios from Sicily) and that really comes through with the flavor. 

It is a pricey treat but totally worth the cost."}
{"text":"OMG - that's what I have to say about this Quaint Gelato shop. If anyone knows me well they know I don't usually have a sweet tooth... Most are proud when I even eat dessert! My boyfriend on the other hand has a massive sweet tooth and this evening he dragged me after dinner to fulfill is sugar craving. I wasn't sure if I would order anything but after speaking to the owners about their gelato, their Italian training and their passion in authentic flavors and technique completely swayed me to try not one but two flavors out!! I had the strawberry and the chai gelato. The strawberry was phenomenal!!! The owners switch up the flavors as the fresh ingredients go in and out of season and luckily we were able to try the strawberry before it was sold it !  The chai was absolutely delicious as well, there isn't actually tea in the gelato, they steep all the fresh spices prior to adding it to the mix. I definitely recommend this spot -- this non - dessert lover will be back !!!"}
{"text":"Love it! Perfectly delicious and fresh gelato! Cute place, nice staff... a danger to have close to home :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here after seeing it featured in Charlotte magazine. They are a little white building located in the middle of Park Road Shopping Center. Their gelato is made from locally sourced milk which is great! We got a regular size to share which was $5 and we got to choose 2 flavors. We got the stracciatella which was sweet cream with chocolate chips and the bacio which is a hazelnut milk chocolate. The size is pretty small, but as far as I know it was pretty good gelato. It was very creamy and not overly sweet. Not sure I would come back because it is a bit pricey and I prefer ice cream. For those who like gelato though it's a good choice!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place. The gelato is legit amazing! The lemon ricotta is TO DIE for. Everything is good & they have excellent customer service. I wish it were at tad cheaper so I could eat it all!!!"}
{"text":"You have not lived until you had real fresh house made gelato. The lemon ricotta and cannoli are two of my favorites... I love the fresh ingredients and the flavor profiles they put together. Forget any of those chain ice cream places, this place has charm, amazing gelato and is locally owned and operated."}
{"text":"Heaven to a girl that likes real flavors and fresh ingredients. Amazing. Go to this place ASAP!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best. Ingredients are so fresh, organic, local just amazing. Can't recommend it enough. Owners are so friendly.  For all the haters that didn't leave five stars, you are ridiculous it doesn't get better, the care and love in the product and service is unmatched."}
{"text":"This is the very best gelato in Charlotte.  The chocolate is creamy, the coffee bean is just the right balance, the pistachio is to die for and the cantaloupe was very refreshing.  We're clearly coming back and recommending to our friends."}
{"text":"The gelato is off the charts - flavors and ingredients so unique.  Best I have ever had!  Favorites are Cannoli with Pistachio, Coffee Bean and Hazelnut."}
{"text":"What an amazing treat to Park Road Shopping Center & Charlotte.  On a hot afternoon I decided to stop in and was overwhelmed by the welcomed greeting from the owner and, I believe, his daughter. Not only do you get to taste a variety of flavors you get an explanation of how gelato is made, temperature it is stored at, and great service. After tasting the lemon and coffee bean I was sold. I chose the medium cup with both flavors, and oh, what a treat! I am Italian and have grown up with gelato my entire life. Va Da Vie is one of the best I have ever had. Don't miss this new gem in Park Road Shopping Center."}
{"text":"Was in italy for a few weeks and this is as close as it gets. Hubby and i shared a pistachio, coffee and chocolate and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"The two starts is for over experience. I was there on Thursday afternoon with my friend . we went to the bakery before hand and stop at to get something cold so we Two have two order of two scooped of Gelato it was REALLY GOOD. I reason I'm giving two starts was we were told to tell ours friends about this place and we were really excited to do so. One of the staff told us that we can't take pictures of the Gelato or was it no picture allowed. Weird. So I open my cupcake inside the shop hoping to get a taste of that. But they were super strict about outside food coming in. We move out side and the staff stills follows us to outside and told us we can't get ours bake good there. To be fair we bought two cup of gelato from them that I haven't finish and was focus to leave their outside siting. If that's not rude I don't know what is. As good as the place is I will not be returning to such a business practice. I felt like they were being racist even. They were strict about pictures and being in social media this business is probably practicing something else"}
{"text":"Well Created Gelato:

Neat spot that used to be in the middle of a parking lot.  The place seemed to spring up over night but i bet there was lot of thought put into the place.  It is a very classy and well though establishment.   They offer about 8-10 selections some of which can be a sorbet.  

They have some great locally source fruit concoctions.   Price is higher than you standard change ICE/Desert places. But the quality is really good.  Come here after you have eaten, but before they close, which can be early."}
{"text":"One scoop Cannoli. One scoop Fior di Latte. The consistency was nearly identical to my experience in Italy. The staff was very knowledgeable about which flavors contained what ingredients. I will certainly return."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of unusual flavor combinations when it comes to desserts and Va Da Vie delivered! Outside of the classic strawberry and coffee which were delicious, the Strateiatella had to be my favorite. Take advantage of the multiple flavor combinations per serving."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and the best gelato in Charlotte. The staff explained every flavor so well. Will definitely be back and will tell friends"}
{"text":"Oddly placed in the middle of the Park Road Shopping Plaza but don't let that stop you. Va Da Vie is the spot to go to for awesome gelato. The store is super clean, the ladies behind the counter are super friendly and helpful and the gelato is yummy!

\"Small\" is a single flavor in a small cup and \"Large\" is two flavors in the cup. I'd really recommend the large as you get two of these amazing gelatos. I chose the Pistachio and the Cannoli. They went together so darned well, I nearly went back for seconds. Delicious!

There is a short counter inside and a few tables outside."}
{"text":"Ask me to rate the gelato, I give it a 5, ask me to rate the service, Only reason why I wouldn't give it a zero is because the male owner is so kind and accommodating. 
Let me explain: we were out shopping and I have been wanting to show my husband this place for months now. It's just before lunch and we have two little toddlers so we didn't want to spoil anyone's appetites, but we had to at least TRY it when we had the chance. Well we get in and the (male) owner (I'm guessing they're a couple and he's the husband?), he was so nice explaining all the flavors and letting us try them all, it was so interesting to hear the story and since we were the only ones in the store we took our time deciding. The wife comes out after a few minutes and asks what we want-- we said we would share a regular (2 flavor) and she gave a look of disgust on her face. Then, as she started scooping it she (directing it to her husband about us) says under her breath, \"waste of our time.\" She then asks to make sure we really didn't want anything else with our order and I proceeded to say that was all we wanted, (she was clearly unhappy about it) and she then gave it to her husband to ring up. 
What a terrible attitude and service. I am sorry to write this for the sake of the husband who clearly has a passion for the business and customer service, but I was appalled at how she treated and reacted to us. 
I will most likely not be visiting this place again, because of this extremely awkward experience."}
{"text":"Amazing gelato. I got the lemon ricotta. My wife and I both loved it. I really don't know what else to say except go get gelato you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent handmade gelato, you will not be disappointed.  They use fresh, local ingredients and are passionate about their product.  You can't find great gelato like this, they are a rare gem in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Must try! Gelato of all kinds of flavors. Friendly service too and will let you try samples to decide the flavor you want."}
{"text":"You MUST try this gelato. 

Every flavor is done in small batches, hand made by people who really care about their business, product, and customers. I love taking people to Va Da Vie for their first time. You're free to sample any flavor you'd like, so you don't feel overwhelmed that you have to stick with a full cup if it's not your favorite. And they never shame you into feeling like asking for a sample is wasting their time. 

It's great to know there are still people out there that put a value on fresh, local products. You don't get this kind of flavor from any old chain ice cream shop! 

My all-time favorite is the cannoli. Such a variety of subtle, complementary flavors and a little salty crunch... MMM! They also have dairy-free sorbet options that are just as delicious, if you can't/don't do dairy."}
{"text":"Delicious gelato! Kind staff...they were kind to our young children, although I feel it's more of an establishment for an older audience. As I mentioned before, the gelato is delicious, but pretty expensive for the amount they give. If we happen to be in the area maybe we will stop by again for more, but we won't go out of our way to get it."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place on Yelp of course and after only being open a few months and with 30 reviews I really wanted to check it out. Gelato in Charlotte, how perfect! 
Located smack int he middle of the Park Road shopping center you can't miss this cute little white bungalow, filled with Italian perfection. 
This had to be a group event since I was so excited to stop by! Colin, Brittany and I made a special trip simply for Gelato and we showed up right before they closed.  Even in the middle of closing up shop, the family owned business was happy to serve and chat with us. 
Using local and fresh ingredients, this place is greaaatt, I'm still dreaming of gelato. 
I got coffee and toasted almond flavors, Brittany went with vanilla and coffee while Colin choose vanilla and watermelon. All were fabulous. Yummmm! I hope nothing but growth and happy customers for this new business."}
{"text":"Gelato at it's finest.

Quaint shop with very nice owners. They take a lot of pride in their product and it shows in their customer service and the product that they serve. 

If I lived closer, I would be sure to visit on a weekly basis. The gelato is creamy, velvety, rich - divine to put simply. The chocolate is rich but without the overbearing sweetness that you would find in an American chocolate bar or ice cream. The pistachio made with Italian pistachios was the best hands down ever. 

If you want good, authentic gelato then this in the only place you will need to come in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the taste of their gelato, and only for that reason have been coming here more than 4 times, despite me hating their owners and overall customer service. There is no other place with such uncomfortable service as at this gelato store. You were warned."}
