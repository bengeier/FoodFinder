{"text":"The lobster roll has been excellent. However the lobster mac today sucked the lobster tasted old. At $14 per bowl I want it not to taste fishy and bad."}
{"text":"Alright Boulder City, tired of bar food? Then get on over to The Tap on Nevada Way in old town Boulder City. Here you go with top flight fusion; Asian, Gulf Coast, East Coast. Finally food you normally had to drive to high end Restaurants on the strip to enjoy. Breakfast, Dinner and some of the best ales this side of the U.K.   The people are fantastic."}
{"text":"Cool oasis on a scorching day. The French Dip was superb and don't miss the  Coconut Porter - Maui Brewing Co. HI."}
{"text":"Back at the Tap.  Sat outside under the misters. Very nice  Micquelle was our server. Very knowledgeable not pushy not hovering   Citrus mistress IPA beer was great.   Avocado tacos very very good. Three of them. Rice and beans good served separate. Nice presentation   The Thai chicken salad was very good. Perfect size proportions. A bit dry for my taste but she gladly brought me more dressing. Nice spicy bite to it. Served with fresh melon."}
{"text":"I never leave reviews but the experience was bad enough to make an exception. I got the chicken bowl and my boyfriend got the fusion burrito (steak and shrimp, I believe). The chicken was stringy, thin, and tasteless and the rice was literally swimming in soy sauce. I couldn't cut my chicken in the bowl itself because it would sink to the bottom of the bowl because there was so much soy sauce in it. There was barely a sliver of steak in the burrito. A $50 dinner in Boulder City shouldn't be this pathetic. To say it's not worth the cost is to say the least. The food runner was a young kid with a lot of hustle, he was the best part of this place. Otherwise, service was slow and inattentive. To top it off, we literally felt sick for two days after. I've never regretted a meal as much as this one."}
{"text":"The breakfast was awesome.  Had the Deep South Biscuits and Gravy, and the biscuits were light and gravy was great.  The two eggs were cooked just right.  The service was awesome. The price was was very comparable to other places and probably less than most.  Great food - great price - great service.  Definitely would do it again.  The wife said pancakes were a bit heavy but not bad at all."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast today! Super friendly staff. Food was hearty! Get the chicken & waffles!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, fantastic food! Had the lobster roll and miso truffle fries. Kim our server was very attentive. Signature cocktail was great!"}
{"text":"Cool spot! Good beer selection. Great, friendly service. Next time I'm here I'll definitely pick this place over the others and get some of their (tasty looking) food!"}
{"text":"Came in here after a morning on the shooting range for lunch and it was good. Nice and clean, friendly wait staff, I'm so sorry I can't remember our waitress's name but she was blonde and teaches Pilates and gave excellent recommendations. We got the giant pretzel and miso truffle fries as an appetizer-both really good. Probably wouldn't get the truffle fries if I was alone because they are rich. I got the lobster roll and it was amazing with the bay fries-per our waitress's recommendation. Only complaint is my boyfriend's burger was a little burnt, which is surprising since their other restaurant is all about the burgers, but he ate it so it couldn't be that bad  Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Best Moscow mule, and ask for their homemade chips!! The staff is the best, friendly, patient and helpful. The art in the back room is awesome too."}
{"text":"Oh I am so in love with Boulder City's latest addition to the dining scene.   With the same owners as the Dillinger,  I'm not surprised that it's fun,  hip,  and full of flavor.    The ambiance is industrial meets hand carved,  with tons of wood and a really great patio for outdoor dining.  The draft beer menu is fun,  but not quite as broad as I would like.  They are new,  so I'm sure with time they will expand the beer program to include more IPAs, less sours, and more bottled beer selections.  I was happy to see lots of local selections though. They do sell growlers,  so you can take home a fresh draft.    The food was outstanding.  The menu had so many delights on it,  it was hard to choose.  I happened to get there on a Taco Tuesday,  so I tried the avocado tacos,  pork belly tacos,  and couldn't resist getting a side of the Miso Truffle fries.   The tacos were wonderful and just the right amount of spicy.  Innovative ingredients,  cooked to perfection.  The real star though were the fries.  OMG  I'm not usually that big of a French fry girl,  but wow those flavors were unbelievable,  and the fries themselves were so crisp and tasty.  Needless to say,  my diet went out the window after the first bite.  Super friendly staff and great home town feel without feeling like you're an outsider.  A must stop if you're in BC."}
{"text":"I've been staying at the (attached) Best Western the last three nights for a film festival. And haven't eaten anywhere else. Haven't really needed to. The menu, and execution, here is too good to prompt wandering.  Not to mention the staff is amazing, the beer selection's great, awesome patio, they have a cozy, stylish room for live music.... Props and thanks, Tap!!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection! We got the freakin huge pretzel and well, it's huge! Good atmosphere and cute patio."}
{"text":"4.5 stars! This was my first visit to The Tap and I'll definitely be back soon, for breakfast again and/or to try their lunch and dinner menu.   My boyfriend and I came in on a day off to enjoy a relaxed breakfast that wasn't from a traditional \"diner\" atmosphere/cuisine; so I went to the most trustworthy of resources- YELP! and was happy with the consistently good reviews of this bar/restaurant and even more pleased to see they served breakfast so we decided to give it a try.   The interior is a cozy space with a bar vibe first and foremost; it has an unfinished, industrial style and a large patio that I can definitely see myself enjoying during the summer evenings. Even though the accommodations feel like you're in a \"bar\", the extensive, Mexican inspired, menu with unique dishes are anything but standard \"bar food\". Matching the rustic but refined interior- high quality food and drinks. They feature two specialty cocktail menus; one devoted completely to Bloody Mary interpretations- Yum!   For breakfast, Taylor tried the \"All American\"-exactly what it sounds like: eggs, potatoes, choice of meat and bread, with a regular drink included. The sausage was really high quality, I am usually leery of ordering it but I would order it for myself in the future. And I had the classic Benedict...  Now let's digress on the Benedict for a moment; I have lived in Vegas for several months now and have yet to find a diner or breakfast place that poaches an egg for the dish (and the hollandaise is often lacking). STOP THE PRESS! The Tap actually makes a true Benedict by poaching your eggs! And they have a pretty good hollandaise to boot, I'd prefer a touch of lemon but the consistency and richness is exactly what it should be. The search for a Benedict worth the title is over! I'll be back for the Benny for sure!   With attentive service and reasonable prices, I will definitely be back for a lunch or dinner service and update accordingly."}
{"text":"Right at our hotel is \"The Tap\" which is run by a local business that provides a far higher standard of food than most hotel chains. Inside is a comfortable bar area where you can sit or go outside. We ordered a simple cheeseburger with lettuce and tomatoes and it was really good along with french fries that were also better than average. The staff was very friendly. If we were staying longer we would have certainly stopped in again."}
{"text":"We are locals and were pleased with our past visits to The Tap. The chicken in the Maple Whisky chicken salad has always been tender and fresh tasting. The chicken in the Thai rice bowl was fabulous. Today we stopped in for breakfast and ordered the chicken and waffles. Frozen, processed chicken!! I can spot it and taste it a mile away!!  Hubby agreed. Sad to see the food quality is already starting to decline."}
{"text":"I just randomly stopped in to this place, it was so good. Best bloody Marys, try the Cajun one. Had the burger with truffle fries for lunch, it was so good I went back for dinner the same day and had the Irish nachos and the pork belly bowl, amazing. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Strange SMALL menu. If you are into craft beer it is OK for the bar side. They have only one or two domestics on tap and no bottled beer. Charged $15 and change for a lobster roll and fries. I am a salt junky and the fries were waaaay too salty even for me. Good atmosphere and efficient staff got the two stars. I doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good poutine in the US. This place has an amazing South West Poutine that fills you up and pairs well with beer. They're open late for Boulder City which is really nice."}
{"text":"Very clean, baristas are very friendly. They are open all day. Their selection of beers is very unique. They serve breakfast all day. Even though the choices are limited the food is very tasty and there is lots of it. Large pretzel and dipping cheese, Belgium waffles, chicken salad with maple whisky dressing just to share a few of your choices. They offer indoor or outdoor patio seating. Inside they have 2 large TVs over the bar, outside the misters are going to help keep you cooled. I will come back here if I am ever in the area again."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! DON'T EXPECT TO GET SERVED FOR OVER 20 MINUTES EVEN IF THEY ONLY HAVE 5 TABLES OF COUPLES ONLY!!! We arrive and was seated right away. But we waited for the longest time to get even a menu. tmThe couple who walked in before us and the other couple after us not only got their waters, the waitress also serve them their drink orders and took their food orders. She did acknowledged us and finally gave us our food menus, but no drinks or anything else. She apologized to us for the long wait and that she would return when she dropped off the drinks to the table right next to us, which is the couple who walked in after us. But after she did that, she went to another table to grab their orders instead. By this time, we have already waited over 20 minutes and she still hasn't come around. We just got up and walked away, walked over to Southwest Diner, and had our drinks and order all done in less than 10 minutes of walking into the place. Don't go to this place when their neighbour across the street can do it better and faster."}
{"text":"Date Night!! We stayed at the adjoining Best Western Hoover Dam (check out my 5-star review of them) and had dinner here.   We had a really good time hanging out here. A great ambience and vibe. This is the place to be for craft beer. I'm not even sure they have bottled beer. And truth be told, with the selection hey have on tap, who needs a bottle? Good music playing the whole night. Didn't sit outside this time, but the patio is right off the sidewalk and would be a great spot to hang out, people watch, and watch the cars go by. With the patio being \"curbside\", it has a kind of \"beach city\" feel which we totally dig.   Anthony was behind the bar while we were there and he was awesome. Knowledgeable on the beer and drinks and quick on the service.   Food was good, not great. We started with the Crab Crake appetizer. Now, we are Crab Cake snobs. So take that into consideration. Crab cake here was decent. Quite a bit of filler (lots of breading). Could use more crab. The dipping sauce was very good. The breading did have a very good flavor. Order it again? Not regularly, but I would again. For entree's, I had the French Dip which was solid. I got it with the Bay Fries and those were GOOD! Just a little bit of zip to them, which builds up the more you eat. The fries were a great compliment to an IPA. My wife had the \"Hold-My-Beer\" Hot Dog. Not bad. Not bad at all. What were great, were the Truffle-Miso fries that we upgraded to. What ever entree you get, I highly recommend upgrading the fries to either the Bay or Truffle. Totally worth it.   I totally recommend The Tap. Owned by the same people who brought us The Dillinger, it's got a great vibe, and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The best place hands down in town. Fabulous menu, where everything is to die for. The only thing better than the food is the amazing staff. Do your self a favor and try it out when you're in town.  Side note: they're not kidding when they say \"giant freaking Pretzel\""}
{"text":"This place is affiliated with the Dillinger in Boulder City but has a completely different menu. It is located on the first floor of the Best Western on the street side and was easy to find.   We were looking for somewhere to have a couple of drinks and some light dinner. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and directed to either have a seat in the bar area or the dining room. They have a dining room. We chose to sit in the bar and Anthony stopped by to take our drink orders. He provided us with menus and was very attentive.   We asked him what his favorite menu items were and one of the items he suggested was the avocado tacos.  My wife decided on the tacos with a side of rice and beans while I choose the Southwest poutine.  Our food arrived and looked and tasted delicious.  The interior has a cool industrial feel and was very comfortable and trendy.  Thanks Anthony for a great experience!"}
{"text":"The Tap and it's sister location The Dillinger are both excellent  locations with a diverse draft beer selection and excellent food. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and for being a hotel restaurant that's usually hard to come by. Good job Best Western!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch.  The Crab Louie salad was fresh and filling.  Loved the spicy salad dressing that came with it.  Since I am not one to order drinks the taste of the water is a sign to me of a clean restaurant.  The water here is really good.  Would highly recommend and sitting outside is nice."}
{"text":"Really poor service!  My first trip to The Tap was pleasant and food was good.  Last week I brought my husband and my friend with me and it was awful.  I could not believe it was the same place!  Food was just ok - and not hot.  All three of us ordered toast with our breakfast and only one of us got it.  Had to ask twice for the other toasts.  And forget about coffee refills, the bartender and server were both doing their own thing.  I was so disappointed.  Back to The Coffee Cup."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. The bartenders are personable, the staff friendly, and every meal I've tried so far has not disappointed. Also, the Ginger Rogers drink is deceptively refreshing. You almost don't know it's a cocktail."}
{"text":"A couple of family members ate here and enjoyed the food and beer so we decided to have lunch today. One had the Chinese Chicken salad and she thoroughly enjoyed it. Another opted for a cold brew and the Foot Long Hotdog which he managed to actually finish all of. I saw the Avocado Tacos and asked our server if she'd had them and if they were good. She said they were good and popular so I made them my choice with the addition of rice and beans. First thing I noticed was that they're served flat & open on the plate with the ingredients fully visible and there wasn't much to see!  I wish I'd taken a photo showing how sparse the ingredients were on the tortillas, literally the avocado wedge was so tiny that I had to move the droopy lettuce to find it! The three of us estimated it to be literally 1/8 of a wedge from half a small avocado. We didn't have the time to wait for something else to replace it so I ate them along with the beans, didn't eat the rice which was dried out and seemed to have been yesterday's fare. I told our server when she inquired about our meal that she should clue in the chef and/or owner that to serve such a meager portion of avocado was going to cost them customers. I certainly wouldn't order these again and after looking at other reviews photos I saw one pic which shows a decent portion and another where you cannot even see the avocado, just like mine was. We shared an order of the Miso Fries which get excellent reviews, very tasty sauce full of garlic flavor but the fries were just the greasy, coated frozen ones many burger places serve. Seems a shame they don't put this yummy sauce on some real hand cut potato fries.  We were the only customers there at lunchtime and admittedly I won't be in a hurry to return."}
{"text":"Reviews of new restaurants are hard to leave, as often times establishments are still ironing out the kinks. Typically, however, this is only pertaining to logistics. \"Where is table 7 again?\" Yadda yadda yadda.   The Tap was not immune to opening night kinks, but boy did they handle themselves well. On top of good customer service for a soft opening, let's talk about what people really come to bars and restaurants for: FOOD AND ALCOHOL.   Food: Fantastic. On par with the Dillinger. Their fries are AMAZING! Try the French dip; Tami says to definitely try the horseradish that comes with it. Dip the fries in it, she screamed at me from across the bar! Lololol.   Alcohol: Amazing selection at great prices!!! Can't beat this!   All in all, we had a great time here! Can't wait to come back once they're fully open and rollin'.   Would I come back here myself? Absolutely.  Would I recommend this place to others?! You bet."}
{"text":"This place is great! If you're ever in Boulder City, you need to plan your trip to stop here at The Tap!  The food was amazing, I got the chicken and waffles, so good, tasted great and the perfect portion. It went along great with my premium Bloody Mary (I got the Samurai). They have a great list of beers and a lot of them being local, they also have a great list of Bloody Mary's. The menu isn't too big, and a ton of options for even the pickiest eaters! The wait staff was great, very attentive and friendly. We were welcomed in with a nice hello and showed us right into the dining area. Our waitress was extremely nice and cheerful.   Like I said earlier, if you're ever in Boulder City, you need to stop here! You'll be doing a disservice to yourself!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the taste of the food we got. Loved that they were very pet friendly. Saturday and sundays have an extended menu. So go on the weekend if you're going to order crepes or the Benedict's"}
{"text":"Hotel bar/restaurant located in downtown Boulder City.  This review is for breakfast only. We came on a Saturday morning around 10:00am. The bar was open and served a full menu. We started with the mimosas which were delicious. For my meal I had the chicken and waffles. The chicken was boneless and had a good flavor.  Friendly service and good prices."}
{"text":"Came for the beer, but gotta talk about the food. This is actually a small gastropub next to a BestWestern. Lots of parking with in and outdoor seating.   Rotating drafts. Their salads can be converted to wraps. Now to my LOBSTAH roll. I substituted the hoagie roll with yummy toasted sourdough bread. I upgraded my fries to miso fries meaning it was drizzled with a mayo-miso sauce and sprinkled with green onions. Back to the lobstah mix. It had expertly minced celery and peppered mayo dressing. Chunks and chunks of identifiable lobstah meat and clahwz pieces. Seriously, genuine real lobster pieces. Just get it already."}
{"text":"Outstanding! The service was first rate. Very attentive. We had a group of 14 people, and the staff was all over it. I could not have been more pleased with the service. I was also watching other parties and noticed that they seemed to be receiving great service as well. The food is really tasty. The menu is diverse enough to please even the pickiest eater. Near the end of our meal, the owner, Grant, stopped by to inquire about our experience, I thought that was a nice touch. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The Tap was a wonderful comfortable Sunday morning experience. Great customer service and very good food items. We had the Western Frittata, Sausage Gravy Biscuit balls, Lemon Bars, and the Maui Coconut brew. Delicious!! We brought our puppy and sat outside, while watching sports on the TVs!!"}
{"text":"Brand new little gem with a fantastic menu!! Just stopped in for breakfast this morning to check out our towns newest addition.  Great service and Loooove the different options for breakfast! And when it arrived at our table, it was beautiful and more importantly delicious!!! My husband and I  took a peek at the lunch/dinner menu and decided we will definitely he back here! I love how  BC restaurants each have special unique items they are known for and The Tap is no exception...these offerings are unique, tasty and will really make this stand out. PS. My husband wants me to mention the wide selection of whiskeys and beers are impressive and he gives that a Two Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised by The Tap. We had plenty of good beer and good food here, and we will definitely be back again.  So in terms of ambiance, this place screams \"hipster\". I actually just had seen a meme about a \"Hipster restaurant starter kit\" and The Tap was comically the same. They had the same metal stools, the same retro style light bulbs and re-purposed wood look. I'm not saying that's a bad thing though, just an observation.  Now when you walk in you'll notice immediately that The Tap targets the Craft Beer crowd. There is a large list of beers in the center of the bar that pops out and is colorful. I tried quite a few of them, and was overall fairly happy. They have a few local crafts, which I love to see. Unfortunately, one of the reasons I had to give a four star review instead of a five star review is their menu needs more diversity. I've seen a few places with beer menus that are IPA heavy, but this place has a ridiculously heavy menu in terms of sours. If you like sours, then this is your place, but the number one complaint among my group was the lack of variety due to this. To be fair, the bartender was aware of this and said they are going to phase some of the sours out, so I'm hoping to see this change when I return for my next visit.  As for food, my wife and I split the surf and turf burrito and we LOVED it. It was probably the best Asian fusion burrito I have ever had, and I have had quite a few. Most fusion burritos go for a Korean bulgogi flavor that is a little sweet like teriyaki, but not this one. It contains steak and shrimp with fried rice, and if I had to describe it as any ethnic style I would say it leans towards Japanese. The best way I can describe it is Benihana in a burrito. I would come back here for this burrito on it's merit alone.  As for the rest of the menu, it looked pretty good with most of the items looking vaguely fusionistic (yes, I just invented that word). Prices were slightly high, which seems to be a trend in \"hipster\" style places, but not ridiculously so as I've seen at other places. The only other thing we tried was we paid a up-charge on our burrito to have our fries upgraded to Miso Garlic fries (fusion again). We really liked the fries that came with our meal, though I didn't taste any miso flavoring. It was only later we learned they had just given us normal fries. They provided great customer service by bringing us an order of the miso fries at no charge, though to be fair they weren't very good. The miso sauce was overpoweringly salty and I wouldn't get them again.  Speaking of great service, our bartender (pretty sure the name was Anthony, sorry if I got that wrong) was really great. He let me sample a few of the beers before I ordered and took good care of our group. He was very friendly and knowledgeable about the beer.  A few little tweaks here and there and I could easily see The Tap earning five stars. Even as it stands right now, I would recommend anyone that likes beer or fusion style food to come here if you are in Boulder City. I am looking forward to returning and trying some new things (though I probably will still get that burrito again)."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food service!!!! Everything was delicious!!! We'll for sure come again when we come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"The Tap has excellent food. The French dip and lobster roll was very good . Drinks and service were very good."}
{"text":"Great menu and the Crab Louie Salad is my favorite, great selection of upscale beers (dead man ale, my favorite) and COLD!"}
{"text":"Miso fries with truffle oil from The Tap are the single greatest tasting works of art I've ever had in 34 yrs of life. Lobster mac was pretty damn delectable too. Just saying. That is all..."}
{"text":"From the same rad people of The Dillinger. You wouldn't think a place like this would exist out here. Great craft beer and whiskey selections. The Bloody Mary menu, though - omg. Food is amazing. Friendly, genuine staff - go here. The mural though, let's see how many people know where it's from...."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast and it was awesome. Chicken and Waffles, Crepes, Beignets in Boulder City??!!!! All delicious"}
{"text":"We have been trying out all the Restaurants in this cute town and every time we look at this menu my husband could not find anything that he would eat.   I took my 10 year old out on a date and he is like his daddy and there was nothing i could talk him into on the menu (i wanted to try it all). So we settled on sharing a $17 burger and having EVERYTHING on the side. The waitress was rude (i am guessing cause we were sharing). When the burger came it was overcooked but had ok flavor and sauce lots of sauce ... sauce on the patty sauce on the bun. I know that everything on the side is not how the chef would like to make this yummy burger but ...   The waitress came over with her hands on her hips and said she would send the manager over about 10 more minutes passed  (I listened to another table ask for \"something\" to give his bowl more flavor)...I was getting ready to leave and she said they will have another one right out. I felt bad because i knew this was not a cheap burger and my son had been Eating fries and some burger for more the 30 minutes and we where full.   I would have never written about the meh experience exempt the yelp rating was so high and I hate being treated like a second class person cause I wanna share a nice lunch with my son."}
{"text":"Food is ok, service is horrible.  I had stuffed crepes with asparagus and ham topped with hollandaise sauce, potatoes on the side.  Crepes were good. Potatoes were dry. Ron had short stack of pancakes, sausage patties and scramble eggs. It was fine.  We had a hard time getting coffee, silverware, butter and water.  In fact we never got water, they were too busy. Table behind us couldn't get napkins.  If you happen to stop at the Tap, make sure it's a slow day for them."}
{"text":"Great new addition to Boulder City restaurants.  The food was delicious, and our waitress, Shyria, was very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere of the restaurant is attractive and comfortable. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"Service is mediocre. Saw a server hanging out with friends and gossiping about people in the bar. It wasn't berg professional. Kinda makes you feel uncomfortable. The menu wasn't very big, but I ordered the avocado tacos and they were really good. I believe the menu has gotten bigger since I went there. Drinks are a little over priced, but that's any place in Boulder City besides the Back Stop."}
{"text":"Mediocre lunch. French dip lean but not a lot of flavor. Lobster louie salad had good amount of meat but rubbery and tasteless. It is the middle of the desert after all. Big bowl of lettuce with some asparagus and two bites of tomato and green onion garnish. The spicy Louie dressing was good and saved the fish.   Fun decor and good music. Good service."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai wings and a surf n turf burrito that were so amazedly good! Best wings hubby had ever had. The bay fries were awesome.  We will be back.  The service was good too. The music playing was not too loud and a good choice. A lil bit bluesy."}
{"text":"Came to the hoover dam  and after decided to come to boulder city for dinner and drinks . Started off with the ginger rogers which is a cocktail drink with champagne . Tried the lobster roll next and finished with the cheesecake dessert. Btw the cajun bloody mary drink was also delicious. Amazing little spot ! Must try when in town ."}
