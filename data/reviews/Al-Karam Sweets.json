{"text":"The sweet business is good as they don't have to worry about catering to a specific demographic. I bought some sweets from here last night and was happy with their service and the quality of their sweets.
They only take cash or debit. Seriously?"}
{"text":"The best methai ever!!! I was never a fan of methai but this place changed it all for me !! I love the chocolate, toffee, walnut, and pistachio barfi!"}
{"text":"I was in the plaza for some south indian food (Nilgiris) and decided to see if they had a nice sweet for me after my meal.  

I was not disappointed! The quality is really good.  I only ordered 3 flavours as it was just for myself (besan, gajar and pistachio).  next time I will try the milk cake!  

As for service, they are slow.  one person in front of me and there was several people behind the counter but no one offered to serve me and the one person who was serving people, must had been training someone because all they did was follow them around, so I had to wait to be served.  I'm glad it was worth it. It took 10-15 minutes just to get served!"}
{"text":"These people are chronically rude. terrible customer service. If you don't intend to ask any questions or clarifications then you wouldn't notice. Btw the sweets aren't freshly made"}
{"text":"Al-Karam is North America's best kept secret for mithai (Indian/Pakistani sweets). A true gem when it comes to the best quality, best tasting sweets. 

They also sell meat and veggie samosas which are simply amazing. You would never think that a sweet shop would sell such great samosas but I dare you to try them for yourself. Al-Karam is well known for their sweets since they are a sweets shop, but they are also well known for their samosas.

Their storefront is small but quaint. They have a takeout setup where there is almost always a lineup, no matter what time of day it is. They do all their cooking and production in the back, which makes up the majority of their unit. You can select what you wish to order from the display counters, and you're good to go. 

Very quick service once you're up, and the service is great. I've heard some reviews of bad service but I've never had any issues with them and I really wouldn't expect anyone to have any either.

If you're looking for the best Indian/Pakistani sweets in North America (seriously), or samosas which are to die for, Al-Karam Sweets is your #1 choice. A must try - you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Sweets - Delicious! Wide variety of high quality sweets. I cannot get enough of them. Really, when I drive by, I have to stop myself from coming here too often. OMG. 

Samosas - Good but I think A1 Sweets on Middlefield& Finch is better. The veggie samosas were filled with only potato. I think the spicing could be improved as well. 

Service is friendly and efficient. Great place!"}
{"text":"Great little place for halal samosas and Indian sweets.  It's a very small place and can get very busy during Ramadan so call ahead. Parking is a bit sketchy in the plaza. 

Staff are very pleasant and friendly."}
{"text":"Great place for Indian sweets. I was surprised by the large variety of sweets. Possibly the best Indian sweet place in Toronto. Staff was courteous and efficient."}
