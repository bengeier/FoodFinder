{"text":"I was feeling very excited about this cafe, being so close to my house and looking so cute, but now, I'm feeling not so sure about this cafe. 

I loved the ambience and the decor along with the giant windows, perfect for peoplewatching the few people that lived around the cafe. The tiny lights hanging from the ceiling were adorable along with the wooden wall in the back. A bit tight, but not so much that I felt trapped and lots of small tables. I tried out the chai latte, which is one of the reasons this place doesn't get that much stars: it tasted like water, which is pretty rare with this drink. Also, I was spending some time on my cellphone because I was waiting for someone and had nothing else to do. The owners talked about how young people these days spent all their time on their cellphone while looking at me, which made me feel a bit unconfortable. 

But I really don't want to judge this place too quickly, so I'm probably going to come back next time and try out a new drink, without spending so much time on my phone!"}
{"text":"C\"est un cafe sympa avec un bel emplacement. Seulement ma table etait bancale et sale. Dommage que seulement l'un des deux propriétaires soit souriant et poli. Le chcolat chaud etait disons ordinaire. Une visite pour donner la chance aux coureurs, ce n'est que mon avis."}
{"text":"This neighborhood cafe was excellent. They were very friendly- patiently and kindly walking me through the menu in English as I have absolutely zero French skills. The coffee was excellent and the food was simple but well prepared, well presented and delicious. The space has a lot of natural light, is tastefully decorated, and felt very tranquil. Overall it was a great way to start a day of vacation in Montreal."}
{"text":"Café de quartier très sympathique! Menu avec des ingrédients de qualité. Je retournerai avec plaisir."}
{"text":"Super petit café qui vient de s'installer dans le quartier Villeray. Lumineux, et des propriétaires chaleureux et très accueillants. Les déjeuners sont excellent et le menu change à chaque semaine."}
{"text":"Cool organic cafe with very friendly employees.  I didn't order anything, but my companions ordered drinks and they loved them.  So fine by me."}
{"text":"Un nouveau petit café dans Villeray !
C'est joli, de la place pour travailler, du wifi et surtout du bon café :) 
On y trouve également un choix de patisseries, un menu du jour (sandwichs essentiellement) et de quoi dejeuner.
Hyper lumineux !"}
{"text":"Joli et calme environement , les saveurs et l'intention est là mais je trouve que ils pourraient ameliorer les prix ... ou changer le format des verres et des portions pour balancer le rapport qualité/quantité prix.. j'avais encore super soif apres mon thé glacé..."}
