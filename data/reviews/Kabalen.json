{"text":"One of the best \"turo turo\" filipino restaurants we've been to, if not THE BEST!! Kapangpangan know how to do it right!! They have combo deals, pick 1 dish with rice and a drink for $7.99 or pick 2 dish with rice and a drink for $9.99. We originally ordered 2 combo #2's but after trying our meal, we got 2 more combos, palabok and torons TO GO! You have to try their Kare Kare, Lechong Sisig, and Beef Kalderata! Its A MUST! They also have hella good torons for dessert.   They have an awesome set up, an upstairs eating lounge with SPACE. If youve been to other filipino restaurants in the city, you know how tight the spaces can get. Great for a party lounge! Will definitely be back to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Food is ok. The Bicol express was good. The dinuguan was thin (malabnaw). Parking lot is congested. Restroom is downstairs. There's more seating upstairs."}
{"text":"This place is a typical cantina style Filipino restaurant which serves dishes cafeteria style. You would just come in, point to what you like, they'll gladly scoop it up and pack/prep it for you on a  plate. My boyfriend and I were trying to find a place to order party trays for Christmas and decided to do some testing  first and ate there first before making a decision. We ordered crispy pata and adobo and yes we were convinced it was good enough.  For our Christmas family party. we ordered chop suey (veggies w/ quail egg), lumpia, lechon kawali, pork skewers, and pancit bihon canton. All were super delicious, greasy, but delicious goodness. The pork skewers were nice and sweet and savory because of the banana ketchup, the lechon was crispy to the taste and everything else was decent. These were all fairly safe choices of dishes to order and it all came up to around 2 something bills. Just to let you guys know, they do fiesta ham here as well but we only knew that once we had got there to pick up our order. On the second floor they had Red Ribbon products, dessert items like buko pandan, ube etc all ready to buy with cash only. It was a first come first serve kind of basis for those items.  Honestly, I really like this place more than Sampuguita Village, despite some recommendations there. I just find the food more flavorful here and not only that, they had expanded their location to a pastry shop on the other side of the street. Must be a sign they are doing well!  Anyways, really recommend ordering here for party trays or just to visit and have easy, casual Filipino lunch."}
{"text":"I always come here to dine, and I was satisfied with the grilled servings.   But one day I came for halo halo and I was not satisfied. It was so commercial, the ice cream toppings , it's like less half teaspoon only, and the sweet beans, as if tinipid ng tinipid. It was more shaved ice than sweets. We are in Canada, give a serving that we deserve.  For Halo Halo , I may say Sampaguita Village serves the best. I hope you improve your Halo Halo. And the servers should smile at customers, some of them were a little snobbish."}
{"text":"Been buying food here due to food is very delicious, Im giving 2star because I found hair on my bbq ,pls pls advice your staffs to wear hair net,this is very important, sanitation is very important. Definitely not my hair,I have long thin hair."}
{"text":"My sister and I was there during the dinner time rush last night. I love Filipino food especially home cooked from my grandmother, mom and aunts/uncles. The restaurant is clean, organized, modern and the atmosphere was inviting. Taking a peek from outside this is what drew me inside and wanted to see what the line up was all about. I studied the prices which I thought were high for the ratio of food but I don't mind paying for authentic ethnic food. I like supporting small local businesses. The staff is friendly, polite and takes their time to spend their service on you. I like that I wasn't  rushed and he was very accommodating. I decided to do take out for my family. First, I saw the desserts. They look so yummy! I picked up the pandan mousse and the macaroons. Then I moved along to select the main dishes. The dishes LOOKED hot, delicious and fresh. Being Filipino born in Canada, I wasn't quite familiar with all the dishes. This is where I got confused. The labels didn't align with the dishes and not all dishes were labeled. I chose three of the most appealing dishes (a chicken dish, a beef dish, and pork dish) with steam rice. I was very excited and very hungry. Once home, we opened the tubs. There was soooo much oil that settled to the top. All dishes were very oily. We proceeded because it smelled delicious. The pork dish was too salty. I like salt on my food but this would drive a blood pressure thru the roof! I couldn't let my mom eat it. The chicken dish was too greasy which left a film on the tongue...more white rice helped. The beef was dry but the oily (quite salty) sauce softened the texture. The white rice was fresh and was the best part of the dinner. We had to throw out the dishes. It was more oil than actual dish anyway. Way too salty and oily for my mom to fix. However, we saved the best for last! DESSERT! This was delicious. I savored and enjoyed each bite. It was my first time at this Filipino restaurant. We may have been disappointed with the outcome of the main dishes but I really would like to go back for the other desserts (ie. Sans Rival cake). Most likely, I will also give the other main dishes another try (ie, Fried Tilapia). They have good reviews so perhaps I picked the wrong dishes this time around."}
{"text":"This is essentially the filipino version of manchuwok where they have dishes served hot and you pick what you want through the glass and they serve it to you. Ive never really had traditional filipino cuisine before so dont have much to reference too. But you can order combos...like 1 rice/noodle and 2 items.   I ordered pancit, adobo, and some minced beef with quail eggs in some tomatoe sauce. Generous portions for cheap. But greasy.....so greasy..that when I got home..I napped for 3hrs after lunch. Flavours were decent, but nothing bursting with flavours. Food is heavy and oily.  Would come back if Im in the area and try other items but would probably only get 1 rice and 1 item"}
{"text":"Food is good-tasting. Price is reasonable. Credit cards are accepted. Customer service needs training! Ambiance is better upstairs."}
{"text":"Food doesn't taste authentic, workers are slow and customer service skills are very low. Hindi masarap at panget yung atmosphere. #HonestReview both dine in + take out is very long wait yet the workers are impatient lol. Don't bother reserving it's not worth the wait. 1 STAR FOR EFFORT. :)"}
{"text":"The halo halo is pretty good here, Its just that the price keeps going up each year. its about 15 min wait for the drink"}
{"text":"Food is good. Just too overprized. I was there today and the lady in the cash register was on the phone speaking to her friend which i find it rude when she should be focusing on her costumer and realized that one of the item wasn't billed. and made me do another payment transaction as if it was my fault and literally want us to take home the food that we bought without lids. Like really."}
