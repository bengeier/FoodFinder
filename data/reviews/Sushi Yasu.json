{"text":"Love Sushi yasu-they are the real authentic deal!! Really lovely service and fantastic food. Lunch special is a great value!!"}
{"text":"Je suis allée manger dans ce restaurant plusieurs fois cette été, y travaillant assez près. L'endroit est très petit, donc souvent très remplis sur l'heure du midi. Si vous êtes plus de 4 personnes, il est très recommandé de réserver. Le personel est très acceuillant et nous sommes servie assez rapidement malgré l'achalandage.  Pour ce qui est de la nourriture, tout est super frais et très savoureux. Le menu est assez varié et pour un prix très raisonnable. Sur l'heure du midi, il y a de nombreux choix en table d'hôte, qui inclut: soupe, salade, thé vert et crème glacée. Pour ma part, mon plat de prédilection est le moriawase. Celui-ci comprend un mélange de sushis, rouleaux de printemps, croquettes de tofu, brochette au choix, légumes et crevettes tempura. Il permet de gouter à un peu de tout. De plus si vous aimez la soupe Miso, celle-ci est vraiment excellente!"}
{"text":"I've come here before years ago, this place was around when sushi restos weren't everywhere yet... not much has changed here.  Anyhow, it's still one of a hand full of restos owned and operated by japanese people in mtl. The menu here hasn't changed much since then, it veers more traditional japanese cuisine, so no you will not have the montreal roll or some funky new spicy mayo fufu roll.  It's quite a full fledged menu, sashimi, nigiri, and some makis, nothing fancy. Appetizers include agedashi tofu, tori karaage (still not up to my liking, still in search of good tori karaage in mtl!!!). They have teriyaki, grilled yakitori and jap style chicken curry. One more staple of traditional japanese cuisine, chawanmushi, which is an egg steamed in broth with mushroom and seafood, the flavors are subtle and an acquired taste. They also have ramen !!!  The standout dish here is the grilled black cod, it is juicy and buttery, nicely done. The sushi is fresh, and stands up nicely, sometimes it's nice to go back to basics and just eat some fish and rice, no mayo, no spicy, no tempura.   Agedashi tofu, bland and the tofu texture was bit soggy and dry inside, it wasn't silky soft inside so for me it's a fail. Tori karaage, fried chicken which wasn't too crispy and it was bland not salt at all... chawanmushi was also bland, prok belly skewer was dry and bland. Ramen and chicken curry were average.  It's a nice quiet resto, and we lingered a while and had a very long conversation, it's a nice ambiance to sit and chill."}
{"text":"My friend introduce my family to this place 2 years ago, and we has been returning regularly. Good (real) sushi in Brossard, not your Chinese sushi buffet quality if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"Best Japanese restaurant in the Montreal area. Food is authentic, prepared by real sushi master, and if you are not into sushi, plenty of other traditional dishes to enjou"}
{"text":"I was discussing with a friend of mine about good and affordable sushi restaurants. He sent me a link to an article from LaPresse regarding this place... I had to try.  As some have noted the service can be a little slow and disorganised. Seems like anything coming out of the kitchen might be a bit slow to get which seems to make some patrons impatient.   The sushi preparation was truly superb. If you have a chance to sit at the bar, you will see true Itamae at work. These are not your average sushi chefs but actual master chefs... not to be confused with what you see in 99% of Montreal's restaurant (other than my beloved Juni).  As I was with a few friends, we all decided to taste different items. I decided to try the Chirashi (as mentioned in the article) and I have to say was not disappointing. My mind was blown by how beautiful and tasty the fish was.   This restaurant isn't the flashy type we've come to see in the city. The plates aren't covered in mayo (if any) , It's very humble and very close to what I remember seeing many times in Japan (+1 authenticity). But if you're planning on going there for a romantic evening and want a trendy place to impress your date, I would not go here. It can get noisy and the service can really be slow (-1).  I got to taste the curry rice and tonkatsu and both tasted exactly like what I've tasted in Japan.  Conclusion: I fell in love with the food here. But if you're looking for a trendy place to go this isn't it.  here is the link for those that are interested (its old but stilla accurate): http://www.lapresse.ca/vivre/gourmand/restaurants/201103/28/01-4383890-yasu-sushi-la-ou-vont-les-japonais.php"}
{"text":"Good food and service. Highly recommend the sushi bar: sashimi, sushi and maki selections are fresh. Dishes from the kitchen are not bad,  especially the beef and chicken skewers, fried skate fish, and crispy silky tofu prepared in a light batter."}
{"text":"It was the 3rd time we returned to this place. All sushi nigiri, warm entrees, main dishes are all delicious! At dinner time, service was a bit too quick. We ordered three ((3) hot starters:  deep fried skate fish with ponzu sauce, crispy fried chicken and steam egg with seafood in a custard cup. Delicious!   Then we also ordered a few things from the sushi list as well:  unagi, mackerel, tamago, ebi, kanikama and avocado maki. Fish very fresh, and the rice between tender and chewy texture.   As far as main courses, we had a curry pork katsu don and a chicken and soft egg on rice. Very good. both our palette are satisifed."}
{"text":"Yasu is one of my favourite places to eat authentic Japanese sushi or meal. This restaurant is a gem, it is petite but a great place to enjoy Japanese food. Yasu is owned by a family.   My favourite meal is their hiyashi chuka. It's a plate of cold noodles with pieces of sashimi layered onto the top. If you are a fan of noodles and sashimi, this definitely is the best meal to order.  As for appetizer, the skate fish is to die for. It doesn't have that ocean smell to seafood. It is deep fried and accompanied with a ponzu sauce. If you are want to try a little bit of everything, I would choose the bento options.   Their katsu chicken always taste fresh! If you love fried tender and soft chicken, go for the curry one or the katsu-don.  The price is amazing considering the quality of the food that you get. Yasu Laprairie would not let you down if you are interested in getting some authentic Japanese food!"}
{"text":"Tout est frais et goûteux. Et c'est à côté de chez nous. Pas besoin de se taper les ponts qui sont pour la plupart soit congestionnés ou soit fermés. Encourageons l'économie locale. Par contre il faudrait faire attention aux clients qui attendent. Nous sommes venus un mardi et la serveuse était seule malgré que le restaurant était plein."}
{"text":"The decor in the resto is bland, but once you try the food, it's all you can think about. The sushi is fresh and all the food tastes authentic. I had the bento box which comes with soup, salad, and a box of sushi, maki, tempura and rice with barbecued eel. It was all delicious. The resto is very small though so you need to make reservations."}
{"text":"What we expected was very different from what we got. The service was unsatisfactory and the food was unacceptable. For example on the menu for one of the combos the description says there is rice and variety of different sashimi. Firstly, we didn't get the rice and the \"variety\" it says there is was nowhere to be seen! This was not the only thing that was disappointing to our dinner. The starting part of our dinner we saw other tables have little beans in a pod and we didn't get it at all! Yet other tables got it. Next when serving to us she looked like she was mad at us the whole time which made us very uncomfortable and  made the experience  horrible. So if you and your family or friends want to come I highly don't recommend it and hope you can find a different place."}
{"text":"Le restaurant est petit, mais bien tenu. Le service était efficace et courtois.  Les sushis étaient excellents et bien présentés. Il y avait un beau choix, la qualité des ingrédients était parfaite.  Les prix était bons compte tenu de la qualité (j'ai déjà vu plus cher pour moins bon).  Une perle de La Prairie!"}
{"text":"Sushi Yasu is a Brossard institution. Started by the Yasu family many years ago, this authentic Japanese family owned restaurant is one of the finest sushi places in the Montreal area. The quality is simply excellent. I highly recommend the sashimi lunch special, for around 15$ I don't believe you can have better sushi within a hundred miles.  If you live in Brossard and haven't tried Sushi Yasu yet, you need to, because you're missing out."}
{"text":"Une partie de ma famille est d'origine japonaise. Vous comprendrez que lorsqu'on mange des sushis depuis la tendre enfance, on apprécie l'authenticité. C'est effectivement ce qu'on retrouve, des vrais sushis, des purs à 100%.  Le service est impeccable, prix abordable et surtout, et j'insiste, surtout, on mange des vrais sushis"}
{"text":"If youre looking for some decent sushi/sashimi, this is where you should go! Depending on the season, they have specials: uni, soft shell crab, black cod etc  I mostly go there for their sushi and sashimi, since price is reasonable for a non all you can eat place and quality is amazing!  Owned by japanese!"}
{"text":"The menu was quite varied. There's something for everyone, even for those that don't like sushi. Very relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff.  The chefs are Japanese, which came as a surprise, since many sushi restaurants around Montreal are owned by Quebecers of Vietnamese origin. Went there on Valentine's night with my loved one. It was pretty busy, so service was a bit on the slow side. We both ordered the table d'hôte. For those looking for a quite full and hearty meal, this is definitely the way to go. It's a five course meal including dessert.  It consists of a choice of soup, salad, tempura vegetables, followed by the main course (quite a choice) and end in a scoop of ice cream with tea. I ordered the tempura vegetables as side dish but got the grilled tofu instead. No big deal for me since I like both. That's where I found that the staff was bit overwhelmed with the massive amount of orders they were getting that night. The food was really good. Not fancy but good. The seating wasn't very comfortable. If you're lucky enough and they're available, do ask for a bench seat on the sides.  I wanted to give it a 3.5 star rating but yelp doesn't allow for half star ratings.  My recommendation to all, go there on a slow night. Avoid Friday and Saturday nights. You'll probably get better service and better seating."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The sushi and noodle lunch special is quite reasonable."}
{"text":"This is the best Sushi I have ever tasted. The fish and sea food are fresh, the service is quite quick. I wouldn't recommend the other items on the menu. But the Sushi is to die for!"}
{"text":"Very fresh sushi, and authentic japanese cuisine. I have never been here for dinner, but I really enjoy their lunch specials. The sushi chefs are Japanese, and one of the waitress is also Japanese. They are all very nice! Overall, I would eat here every week if only it was not in the south shore :("}
{"text":"Wonderful food and extremely friendly staff. I know when I want a great japanese meal, this is where I will go to get my fix."}
{"text":"Sushi yasu has some of the best sushi around. Space is limited so you will want to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Real Japanese restaurant ! We tried bento box and fish sashimi. Everything is so good and fresh. BBQ eel and rice is the best part of the whole bento box. We will try noodles and Japanese curry next time!"}
{"text":"they really know how to treat there customers. such a nice experience will definitely come back."}
{"text":"My go-to sushi place!!! It's a bit out of my way but always worth the trip. Their lunch menu is very affordable and the quality is just superb! Always a satisfying meal. I really recommend you this place."}
{"text":"This along with their sister resto on Rome are two of my fav sushi places. I'm just sad one has okonomiyaki and one has beef tongue....so I can never get both of these dishes at one place.  Today I tried all the new items on their menu and while it's not bad, I still prefer a lot of the items that's already there before. Though their hamachi Kama as really really good.   The three of us ate....pigged out and the bill was still just 50$ tax n tips in. Mind you, one of us is only a toddler but the toddler ate a lot....just saying.  P.s. When you eat in, Edamame is on the house, always!"}
{"text":"Very wonderful experience, the waiter is quite cute( according my boyfriend lol) can speak English japonaise Spanish and français :) The food is fresh, hard to believe the crab sticks are  REAL! ! !not by flour mixed! Super love it!"}
{"text":"My friend told me it's one of the best Japanese restaurants in south shore and it really is! Normally we have to line up there to get a seat in the evening because the place is packed, but when we went there last time it was quite okay and no line-up needed (Friday night at 7PM)! The SASHIMI was the BEST, cannot go wrong with that, they have the plate only or the table d'hôte for you to choose. Didn't try their sushi (they are à la carte) but my friend said that their nigiri are amazing. The dishes are prepared by a Japanese chef and you can see him working on it while you wait patiently for your plate. It was quite an amazing dining experience!"}
