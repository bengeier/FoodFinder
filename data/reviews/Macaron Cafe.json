{"text":"Some of the great flavors and wonderful service....the mocha is my favorite and has the exact amount of chocolate and sweetness..."}
{"text":"Elegant and tasty Macaroons!! Naks was very helpful   and knew all about each flavor! Come buy from here!!"}
{"text":"Macarons are amazing here and Alexis was beyond helpful!!  I drive from Surprise for these! They are the best!!!!"}
{"text":"The Macaron Café has made its premiere on the West Coast! Showcasing flavors like Honey Lavender, Passion Fruit, and Orange Blossom, this new installation at Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall will carry your senses to a flourishing garden of blooming buds and beautiful, photogenic hues. 

Feeling nostalgic about autumnal memories? Sample the \"Pomme d'Amour\" macaron, whose flavor resembles that of the famous candy apple carnival treat. Just in time for the sparkling holiday season, Macaron Café is debuting the \"White Chocolate Peppermint\" macaron, which delivers a slight, yet satisfying chew that [paired with the filling] seemingly melts in your mouth just like chocolate. 

*Enjoy 3 macarons for $8. 

Make a visit during your next promenade in Old Town Scottsdale to see and experience the charm of this famous French pastry."}
{"text":"The macaron's are by far my favorite! They have wonderful coffee, and the new Belgium is delicious! I would definitely recommend coming here, the employees are always so kind and they'll make sure your visit is enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Best place to find ur fav snack :) couldnt find anything like that in a long time, good price and great stuff, thank you"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot .ive tried many different places but this is by far the best place. Alexis is very nice and always patient"}
{"text":"Obscenely expensive and over flavored. I was so looking forward to getting good macarons but was very disappointed. I had the honey lavender, rose lychee, creme Brule and caramel crunch. They were too cold and chewy, and the flavors were so strong it tasted like I was eating a bath bomb. I spent over 12 dollars only to discover they were nothing like the macarons I had grown to know and love. Will not return.  At least the service was friendly."}
{"text":"it's very good!!!  good good     we like sooo much i love the green tea. really good will coming next time"}
{"text":"Amazing cookies need to try! 
They're so soft and come in so many different flavors. You can't go wrong with any flavor so I recommend any of them."}
{"text":"These are the best macaroons  in town. Danielle is so helpful and pleasant to deal with!"}
{"text":"Best macaroons around period....great selection. ..will be back here definitely make it a stop when ypur at arrowhead mall..."}
{"text":"My first time having a macaron, my friends insisted i try them and i am so glad i did! The people who work here are fantastic and friendly, and the macarons are utterly incredible! Fresh and delicious! Haven't tried one i haven't liked! Might have to come back to Arizona just for them!"}
{"text":"I was told about this place by my co-worker and decided to try it.  The macarons I had tried at other place was not very good so I wasn't expecting too much.  Also, they only had the green tea macarons left so I was a bit disappointed.  But since I was there I decided to try the green tea and it was so much better than what I had expected.  It wasn't too sweet, could actually taste the green tea (a bit bitter but had a good aftertaste to it), and good chewy texture.  They are soooo good!!  So now I actually like macarons.  I'll try other flavors next time and post reviews.  And Spencer was super nice!!"}
{"text":"Their cookies are a heck of an indulgence, but the flavors are so intense, and the colors so gorgeous, it's a terrific indulgence!   I always budget for at least three when I go to Fashion Square, and they always have lots of variety -- although if I MUST pick a fave, it would be their Rose Lychee.  A great little spot!"}
{"text":"This is 5 star macarons !!! I love the dark chocolate , I never taste great macaron like this one in Phoenix area.
The stuff over there is amazing , I really recommend to try the 6 pack so you can taste the different flavors they have, they all good..."}
{"text":"Delicious cookies but lousy customer service today. I waited and waited for service. Then realized that I was waiting because the employee was behind me chatting it up with his friends. Ended up leaving without buying anything because I couldn't get his attention."}
{"text":"I always look forward to going to the mall just to get dessert at Macaron Cafe. They have more flavors of macarons to choose from than any other place I know. I love the creme brûlée and pb&j flavors. Seriously so delicious, so fresh and fluffy! Their cute packages make for great gifts too. Worth every buck! Yum!"}
{"text":"Very tasty. 

A bit on the pricey side but understandable given what goes into making these French delights. Went in the afternoon and they were still fresh. Highly recommend the honey lavender and cranberry macaron. Sweet sales clerks also!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Best macarons in arrowhead. Ben was the best, he helped me and my best friend pick tasty flavors!"}
{"text":"So call me crazy but I have never had a macaroon before. These are delish! The cute young blonde girl, Danielle, really helped in my section. I chose the peanut butter and jelly macaroon, OMG! Talk about a moment of zen in my mouth! YUM! Definitely recommend stopping by when you're walking through the mall looking for a tastey treat."}
{"text":"The best place ever I always wanted to try macaroons but never could find a good place I'm glad there around."}
{"text":"I love the macaroons ! Danielle is always so friendly and helps me pick out new flavors every time"}
{"text":"It's a pleasant surprise to see on the west side of town a place that makes gourmet macrons. The downfall is that this place appears gourmet with super delicious until you have one of their macrons. Being that they are nearly $4 each this should be the case. 

The macrons technically appear well made. Then came the taste... They were all too sweet. None of the microns we purchased- Lemon, Raspberry, Orange, Creme Brûlée, and Wedding Cake were filled with French Cream. They were filled with jams and sugary (cheap) fillings, and overall very disappointing. 

As one who will travel great distances for a quality macron, I will have to say that that is still the case."}
{"text":"This is amazing gelato! You have to come and try it! It's all fresh and NATURAL ingredients, plus they have milkshakes now that are by far the best I've had. You absolutely need to head over to the MacarOn Cafe!"}
{"text":"I'm really happy that now at my house have macaron cafe , the macaron is very good  quality,the service is great,I love the Nutella and the Pistachios,the slush cafe is so good I recommend this place :)))"}
{"text":"They have the best matcha macaroons!I love them so much!I always buy a lot of them whenever I go to Fashion Square!They even come in with nice box when you buy a lot.They aren't even too sweet for me.This is the best macaroon I had try so far in Arizona."}
{"text":"I was able to try several flavors from here.  Make sure you let them defrost.  Some flavors do taste better when cool though.

Too bad they closed, their packaging (the clear pink shopping bag) was really nice.  Their prices were just too high."}
{"text":"I stopped and tried a macaron at this place.  I've seen them before but have always been hesitant. These guys lured me in with great personalities, and promised a great tasting macaron. Though I ended up getting the crepes with nutella l, banana, and strawberries. They explained to me what it was, they had me wanting another. I had to split lol. The odds of me coming back to this place is very high I must say. They are very likeable and provide a great, and awesome service. Thanks a lot guys. Special shout out to Ben and Naks. Great dudes."}
{"text":"Yarin was helping us today and assisted us with trying these macaroons.  It is a fun looking place and they are very delicious.  Very welcoming great customer service"}
{"text":"I bought my mom her first macarons from here: Orange Blossom, Lychee Rose, and Matcha Green Tea. Out of the three, we thought the lychee rose was the best. Three macarons for $8. Personally, I wouldn't give this place 5 stars because I believe it is too expensive for macarons. However, their display looks very beautiful. The macarons were nicely made and dusted with shimmer. The customer service I received was alright."}
{"text":"Okay so I've tried this place a few times... and I've had a good experience every single time. It is a kiosk in the middle of the Arrowhead mall on the first floor.

To be honest it is pretty expensive..but when I crave macarons...then YOLO haha.
It's 3 macarons for $8 and 6 for $16 and I haven't bought more than 6 at one time.

The macarons themselves get pretty sweet so 3 to 6 for sharing was more than enough.

So far the flavors I have tried are the following:
-creme brulee (my fave!)
-nutella (doesn't really taste like Nutella in my opinion, but it's like a fudgy brownie..which is totally fine with me haha)
-pistachio (I tried this today and it was delicious! If you like the real pistachio nuts...you would love this! or maybe it was just me..haha)
-white chocolate (it was okay..)
-dark chocolate (yummy!)
-espresso (yummy coffee flavor :))

Can't wait to try more flavors!!

To me it is best time to eat these are fresh from the store when its a little bit chilled. I love the coolness of the macaron and then the chewy and creamy center..yummmm! It's not that good when it's all melted! haha"}
{"text":"Good one tried for the first time really good and tasty the raspberry chocolate and also baklava

Yarin is a good guy who assisted"}
{"text":"Love the dark chocolate and vanilla! Green tea....not so much...overall, pretty good! :)"}
{"text":"I go to the mall about 2x a week & as much as I try to stop myself from indulging in these bad boys, I simply cannot! They're just too good to be true! They're little bites of heaven! I recommend the Nutella & white chocolate one but the entire selection is AMAZING! They are decently priced for macaroons & they even have a points system where you're rewarded for eating them! I see the same girl every time & she's super nice. Sign up for their text messages to get more deals! Super love this stand! I recently just moved to Phoenix so I'll be sad I can't stop by as often in the future but definitely worth a trip when I'm in the Arrowhead mall! :)"}
{"text":"wonderful service and even better macaroons! the flavors are very unique and luxurious. the macaroons are soft and better than others normally. I highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"wonderful service and even better macaroons! the flavors are very unique and luxurious. the macaroons are soft and better than others normally. I highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"Excellent macaroons, I loved the Nutella and pistachios. Excellent service, recommended to come and taste!"}
{"text":"Best macaron at the state ,It is highly recommended to taste never tasted such a good macaroon and quality!"}
{"text":"Excellent selection and very friendly service from Presley! Great first visit - will be back soon."}
{"text":"Gotta admit these macarons were really good. I've been trying out different bakeries and macaron shops and these are by far the best. Not surprising since they are from NY. 

Its a small little stand outside VS on the bottom floor of the mall, can't miss it. Its in the middle of all the hustle and bustle. Pretty good location if you ask me. 

So they had a marshmallow macaroni, different! Had to try it and was super happy I did! Yummmmmmmy! They had a few different flavors as well. They are a bit on the pricey side, but if you love macarons I'd suggest this spot."}
{"text":"Hit or miss for me. My first one was vanilla and it tasted like bacon. The pb&j is one of my favorites. The flavors change which is nice, i just hope the vanilla flavored changed!"}
{"text":"Awesome customer services i really recommended, Ben was really nice and polite he even offers us free frap samples."}
{"text":"I was troubled that they were offering discounts for Yelp reviews, but my wife really wanted to try them.  The prices seemed high to me, $4 per cookie, and you can't buy just 1 or 2, you have to buy them in a small pack.  It was a very expensive purchase for a mall food court.  Some of the flavors tasted OK.  The lavender flavor tasted like hand lotion ... yum.  The caramel flavor tasted burnt and left an acidic/burnt flavor in my mouth.  We ended up throwing out the rest of the cookies in the garbage before we left the mall.  I will not be using this Yelp review to get a discount; I've had more than enough Macaroons for a lifetime."}
{"text":"So good! Yum! A special treat after a long day of shopping."}
{"text":"Isaac is super nice person! Good service!, love this place. Always the best, come on buy. Girls love this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Super tasty! Had the matcha green tea and was super fresh and light! That was the first time having one and now I'm addicted! I'll come to the mall just for one of these! Trying the Nutella, chocolate raspberry, creme brûlée ect! Super excited!"}
{"text":"Awesome service & great treats best macaroons in the state I will come back for sure. And Yaron was so helpful thank you"}
{"text":"Stopped by this kiosk because I am intrigued by anything that is sugary or sparkly. I had never seen a macaron except for a few pictures people shared on the internet. 
    I chose four macarons, which I thought was  pretty expensive ($12) considering the size. I was a little bummed that I couldn't just buy one, so I could try it out and make sure I liked them first. Who am I kidding, these are sugary AND sparkly! Why would they not be absolutely heavenly? Well, they are. I'm glad I had the little bag of four when I got home. I was able to share this great new dessert discovery with my boyfriend.
     I went back a second time, and it was one minute before the mall was closing. The girls working were still cheerful and inviting. Maybe excited that I would be their last customer of the day? I don't care, as long as you're polite. (A few minutes earlier I got aditude just for existing,  from the girls working at Cinnabon just a handful of steps away.)
    The macarons were bomb, again. Consistency. Nice. I should start ordering more of these at a time.
    You might someday try to figure out how to make these yourself, but once you figure out that they are the most difficult dessert to make, Macaron Cafe's convenient selection appears nicer than you could have imagined. They are always stocked up and have several flavors of these sweet little cookies. They are soft (no crumbles, no air pockets) and always taste perfect!!  5 Stars"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this cafe!! I live in Peoria but I'll drive all the way to Scottsdale just to see Danielle and get a tasty treat :)"}
{"text":"What are these people talking about?! I must have gotten the wrong kind or came at the wrong time because my matcha green tea macarons (only ones left at about 4pm) were nasty - they were almost hard as a rock, almost couldn't chew through it. The filling was bitter. My bf said it tasted burnt. For a place called \"Macaron Cafe\" I was expecting to be blown away but I was quite upset. Don't waste your money. This was the first time I've thrown macarons away. One star for the nice staff, free sample of slush (which wasn't good in my opinion) and for being appealing enough to reel me in to buy. But never again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The first MacarOn Café on the west coast and they chose Scottsdale. They are to die for and at a great price for the quality as well! The handmade detail put into each colorful all natural MacarOn with the perfect texture and flavorful inside make them a treat any day of the year!!! 

Besides them all being hand made with natural ingredients, they are all GLUTEN FREE because the fluffy outside is masterfully crafted with Almond milk and Almond flour! They are all LOW calorie, as well as TRANS FAT FREE....which sets them at the top of the podium compared to all the others. The MacarOn flavours are always changing to with about 30 flavours always in stock that also rotate with the Season! 

Its a must to at least try one, but with a warning that you will become addicted...trust me! These MacarOns are MacarOning (Haha I just had too) me crazy!!!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem

Macaron Cafe is the sweetest find in Arrowhead Mall that I've  discovered in ages. The macarons at  Macaron Cafe are to die for. Macarons Cafe offers a variety of different flavors, and I wanted to sample every single one. However,  I controled myself and I tried the almond, creme brulee, and orange. My favorite was the Wedding Almond, very simple, light, with a creamy filling, the Creme Brulee was equally delicious as was the Orange. This little Shop reminded me of the Macarons I get back home in New York and no wonder why the owners are from New York.

Macaron Cafe offers  breakfast, lunch, Baguette sandwiches, croissants, salads, and even lunch specials. On my next visit I plan on trying the white chocolate, PB&J, and pistachio.

If you enjoy great Macarons head on over to Macaron Cafe."}
{"text":"Service was great n macarons were fresh and so pretty. My favourate flavors are green tea and pistacho. I always get the box of 12,,."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The flavors are amazing. I have like most of the flavors tried. I get them every time we make a trip to the mall. Customer service has been great every time."}
{"text":"Great staff. Very friendly. Taste like the real deal. My wife says they taste just like France. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times and they always have amazing service! Danielle helped us this time and she was very patient with us as we took foreverrrrrr to choose and we're back and forth indecisive :P

Pistachio is amazing and the Milk Chocolate Marshmallow Fluff is my favorite so far but that's a season item. Can't wait for it to come around next year, they said around Easter! 

They give you a free slushie if you write a review on yelp, so make it a good one! Definitely a must try place and who doesn't like macarons!! 

Make sure to ask about their rewards program for points to get free cookies! Yay!"}
{"text":"I used to always go way over to Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall for these babies as there's a Macaron Cafe there, but now I don't have to go so far! Which is awesome! I love almost every single flavor, except for Matcha Green Tea.. Not my fave. 

The Pistachio is my top, I always get the most of these and then will try a new one or two as well. The Marshmallow one, isn't always in season, but when it's there it's a must try!! Also creme brulee, vanilla, jasmine, wedding almond, white chocolate, dark chocolate, and orange blossom (tastes like fruit loops). 

I give five stars for this place because I'm so in love with the desserts and convenient location, and the price is better than Scottsdale, but the service could be a little more personable... They always make me feel a bit awkward and uncomfortable when trying to be friendly with them.

PS: Ask for a sample of the Mocha slushie! It's yumm."}
{"text":"Presley the guy working the counter was awesome!!  these macaron's are amazingly delicious.  

Everyone must try when at fashion square 

The best ones I've found in AZ, very close to those I've had in Paris"}
{"text":"Deliciousness!! Come try them.. Super nice staff!; mi favorites are Nutella, coconut, almond; although, I have not tried them all!"}
{"text":"Best place ever, has amazing cookies and good flavors, Nutella dark chocolate and expressio! Good coffee slush too"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just picky with macarons? These were kind of hit or miss for me. Some were pretty good, others were just alright. My sister was in town and is obsessed with macarons, so when we decided to spend the day at Fashion Square, we knew we'd have to try this place out.
The girls working there were not the friendliest. They were not mean to us or anything, they just were not very welcoming and did not seem to want to be there. Also another small complaint was that I did not like how they were displayed in a little plastic tray. Kind of cheap looking, but I know that is not an important factor!
I was excited to see all of the different flavors on display though, most of them sounded amazing. We decided to pick out four to share. The flavors we tried were Nutella, Caramel Crunch, Raspberry Chocolate, and White Chocolate. The first one we split was the white chocolate, and the bar was set high because it was very tasty! Texture and flavor was great. We were not as impressed with the other 3. I thought the Nutella was pretty good, but my sister thought it was too chocolately. The raspberry chocolate was just meh. My sister said it had no flavor. I did not really taste chocolate or raspberry either. It was edible, but I wouldn't get it again. Our least favorite was the caramel crunch, which surprised me. It was just so gritty. Not the most pleasant texture to consume.
I would not go out of my way to come back here, but would not be opposed to stopping back for a delicious white chocolate macaron again sometime."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I learned a very good macaron cafe opened in Scottsdale! After a month of thinking about it, I finally had a chance to visit today.

I got there really late and they only had one flavor left, matcha green tea.  Matcha green tea is my third favorite flavor and this was not what I had in my mind tonight but I wanted to try one from here anyway so I bought one.

After the first bite, I was thinking I should have got two or three.... I didn't go back as I need to watch my girly figure and it was already late in the night.....

Shell was very close to my first favorite macaron store Ladurée.  Consistent, moist, yet not chewy. 

Matcha green tea filling was what I remember from ardeur in Japan. It tasted like real matcha green tea powder, those you get from tea ceremony.

Fillings and shells were nicely put together to create a really good macaron.

I must say this is the best macaron I ever had in Arizona.  Too bad my favorite pistachio or salted caramel were sold out tonight.  It's good sign that they sell out by evening. Who wants to eat the next day macaron anyway.  I will be back to try more flavors very soon."}
{"text":"Yarin was great! Recommended the most amazing flavors! Truly amazing!!! The best in Arizona."}
{"text":"Short and sweet- They have pretty good macarons and have a variety of flavors to choose from as well. Not too expensive either. If you need a few macarons to feed your craving then this cafe in the mall can help you out. Try a few and see what you think!"}
{"text":"These macaroons are amazing! They're so soft and creamy, you can tell that they're amazing quality. I'm a huge macaron lover and these are the best macaroons I have ever had and the customer service is always excellent! I would definitely recommend these, even if you aren't usually a macaron fan. I'll definitely be coming again!"}
{"text":"It's amazing! You must visit it in fashion square! I love the pb and j macaron it tasted amazing and he service is awesome"}
{"text":"Best ever!! Great customer service and the yummiest I've ever tried!! I recommend the vanilla to start with!"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped by the other day and we were immediately hooked! The presentation, the service, and of course the macaroons were fantastic!!  I tried the creme brûlée one and my friend the Nutella one. I can't wait to go back and try other flavors. Did I mention the presentation is absolutely lovely??? And they cater!!"}
{"text":"I love Macaron Cafe. They are delicious and a great gift idea.....Itzhac and Beni are awesome. Customer service is excellent. Try the pistachio and coconut. There is also a second location at Arrowhead so you have double the chances of getting these great cookies."}
{"text":"These macaroons are incredible. They melt in your mouth. Perfect idea for mothers day gift. Lots of different flavors to choose from. I didn't get to try them all so I'll have to keep going back until I have. Highly recommend Macaron Cafe."}
{"text":"They have The most amazing Flavors ! I loved every single one of them ..Except from the Great flavors the macaroon cookies are colorful and pretty ! 
Thanks for a great experience and I will definitely be back !

I highly recommend it !"}
{"text":"I first ate at the Macaron cafe in NY a couple years ago... These are amazing macarons! I'll be back for sure :) the salted caramel crunch is awesome!"}
{"text":"Finally! Perfect moist delicious and beautiful macaron in Arizona !!  

These were good size , tastey and well presented ( and presentation is big part of macaron) .

My favorite macaron and will be back for more for me... And for gifts ! Perfect!"}
{"text":"I work in the area and I have been to Macaron Cafe a few times since it opened. When it first opened, my coworkers and I were very excited because French Macarons are one of our favorite desserts. We tried many flavors the first day it was open including, nutella, dark chocolate, wedding cake, rose lychee and white chocolate peppermint. 

My personal favorite type of macaron is classic chocolate so the dark chocolate was my favorite here by far. The wedding cake and the white chocolate peppermint both had sort of an artificial flavor to me. The sheet that comes with the macaron's says to let them sit at room temp for a little bit but I prefer them chilled out of the case. I have found out that if you refrigerate macarons they get very stale and gross on the outside.

Overall I feel that Macaron Cafe is just okay after sampling quite a few of the flavors. I feel as though it has quite a bit of hype right now because it is new and different but the macarons are really just okay. I have had many better macarons in Vegas and elsewhere.

Service is also not the best which always knocks down a star in my book. One of the cashiers that helped me out last time, snapped at me because he said that he was helping someone else before me which I was not aware of. Rude.

I would come back for a treat here once in awhile but there are a few other places nearby that have better dessert offerings."}
{"text":"Macaron Café is the best macarons hands down in Scottsdale. I love macarons and this is by far my favorite. Great options, and always fresh! Love it!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time trying Macarons and they are amazing! Ben was so friendly and helped me pick some great favors. Definitely will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the girls that work there are worthless.  They offer no assistance and wait for you to approach them.  For being open only a few months you would think that there would be some spark of excitement.  And considering that these are not cheap (almost $3 per macaron) I expect a \"little\" customer service.  The macarons themselves are wonderful...light and airy, crispy on the outside, tender on the inside...these melt in your mouth.  Fix the service and you have yourself a five star rating!!!"}
{"text":"I officially have a new favorite dessert now. Macaroons from here are amazing! I am not a health nut however it is super cool that these are gluten-free as well. I can already tell I will be craving these. My favorite flavor is the wedding Almond!"}
{"text":"These macarons were superb! This little spot in the Fashion square mall is tres- fantastique ! I had the peanut butter and jelly and the lavender honey macarons and was so happy to have my moment of pretending I was in France walking along a cobbled avenue , sipping a latte and eating my delicious macaron..... Alas, I was right in the middle of the Christmas hustle and bustle of Scottsdale Fashion Square ... Still, not a bad place to be!"}
{"text":"I love Macaron Cafe! Consistently great macarons and great service! They always have a bunch of flavors and are pretty much never out of stock of anything. Claudia is so nice and helpful too!"}
{"text":"Delectable bites in various flavors. The macarons are fresh and brought in from New York. I shared a pistachio macaron and a green tea. They both had good flavor, with a good balance of chewy, soft, and crispy textures. The flavor wasn't overly sugary which allowed more of the main flavor to show through."}
{"text":"Quick, friendly and tasty!!!

And NOT dry.!!!

Love this place, its a little kiosk inside the mall,  Its my new go to place for macarons!!!
thanks guys!"}
{"text":"My wife and I found another good reason to visit fashion square.  This place has the best macaroons I've ever had.  There's a big variety and great flavors.  The Nutella and the pistacho is our favs.  The people that work there are friendly and I\"m sure my wife will want to keep going back!"}
{"text":"finally a place to get a variety of delicious and fresh macarons. The number of flavors that are rotated in make it hard for you to choose just one. These tasty cookies are hard to find in this state.

These were moist and baked to perfection. The fillings were perfect, not too sweet or overflowing. The price are pretty reasonable for size of the cookies. They are normally $3-$4 else where. Also they have really good slushes. The white chocolate was creamy and smooth. They have a rewards program to earn free macarons. I will probably have to come here everyday."}
{"text":"Honestly, probably the most convenient way to get a macaroon; I love it. Not only are they delicious but they aren't dry like other ones I have previously tasted. 

Though, I'll admit the pricing did send me running away at first, but it is totally worth it. Money definitely well spent."}
{"text":"Probably the best macaroons ever!!!!!! I recommend this place ate here in NYC and my belly will be happy lol"}
{"text":"I loved the Nutella.  The girl who helped us was super friendly and professional.  Her name is Danielle."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the cup of gelato that I received from this shop. Both flavors were watery and runny and if they call it two scoops I would have to say it was more like one scoop half of each, there probably wasn't more than an ounce or 2 ounces of gelato if that in the cup. Plus I had to stand and wait for almost 15 minutes for anyone to show up to wait on me. Can not  recommend the shop and will never go back! Did not try the macaroons maybe that's their specialty but gelato definitely is not!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place no stars.  My God these are the worst macarons I have every had in my life. Had the crème brulee and lemon macs. If I hadn't have hade these I would have believed someone could do such a poor job making them. I had spit mine out. My husband took one bite and threw the rest away. These were inedible."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Delicious cookies and great service! Love it love it love it! My favorite is pistachio and coconut yammmmmm"}
{"text":"Excellent macaroons!

Confession: I love great macaroons like a baby loves milk. The almond crust exterior, soft interior, sweet paste filling in tempting flavors.  Uber yum.

Macaron Cafe is now in my top three -- following a place in DC, another in San Fran, and now their booth at Fashion Square.

Great assortment of flavors from Cassis, to Honey Lavender, to Green Tea, to Nutella.  All taste great and induce squeals from our little girls. (I love them enough to share. A little.)

The two guys manning the booth shared they are based out of New York.  When I asked them why their prices for batches of more than 12 are *more* expensive than the smaller,they said it's because the larger orders come in a premium gift box.  Then one asked if I was an accountant.  He laughed and said I looked like one of those, too.  Ah, New Yorkers. :o)

Wil be back to buy a box or two as gifts..."}
{"text":"Excellence Next to the Escalators

Swung by Arrowhead Mall after my wife read that a Macaron Café had opened at Arrowhead. We wandered looking for it, before resorting to Yelp. Finally found it next to the food court escalators, downstairs. We passed it twice!

Very nice gal served us and we selected an assortment of 12. Highlights were the Pistachio, Wedding Almond, and Cassis. Dulce de Leche was very sweet and while I liked the Matcha/Green Tea, our little girls thought it was too bitter. 

Top-notch macaroon and worth the stop. Now, I'll just have to be very careful about visiting often... else my body shape will take on macaroon attributes. :o("}
{"text":"I absolutely love the macarons at macaron cafe! My absolute favorite is the wedding almond and I will drive all the way to Scottsdale from Gilbert for these. The only thing I might comment on is the staff. There have been a few times when they're attitudes came off as a little rude and snooty. I understand they are in a higher class mall but that doesn't mean they need to act like they are better than everyone. All in all I love the macarons but I think the staff could use some slight adjustments."}
{"text":"Some of the tastiest macarons I've ever had!!! Yum!! I just tried the pb&j first. Not only are they so pretty but delicious. What a rare find! Thank you so much to the management for your generosity helping us macarons with our French party at our pop up shop today"}

{"text":"This place is absolutely on point with their macaroons. I have tried nearly half the flavors and have yet to be disappointed. The pb&j as well as the honey lavender are to die for. Go during the first half of the day for the best selection as many flavors sell out by dinner time.  Macaroon Café has in my opinion the best macaroon in the valley."}
{"text":"Linda was so helpful in picking the best flavors and had amazing customer service! We will definitely be back to visit!!"}
