{"text":"I had gone to Smoke at its Homestead location and was blown away by the new place in Lawrenceville! The space is so much bigger, but they retained the atmosphere of the old restaurant. The food remained phenomenal. I had the mac and cheese with ribs, which is listed under \"Sides\" but it is a good portion and I even had to bring half of mine home. I also ordered the Brisket taco, which was surprisingly spicy and delicious as well as the specialty taco of the day, which included chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes, gravy, and a sunny-side-up egg. My server warned me it would be a messy disaster, but would be totally worth it; he was right.

The only criticism I have of the new restaurant is that the servers use iPhones to take your order. I didn't like this. It feels almost rude to be talking to your server while they are playing on a phone, even though I know they are entering the order. It just seemed impersonal. I had not experienced this at another restaurant, and it is something I definitely dislike.

Other than that, the decor of the place is almost as good as the food, only because the food is so dang amazing. I love Smoke and will be back many times!"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. Yes the tacos are good, and the queso is AWESOME, but nothing else is anything special. I will never understand why 1 taco costs $7 or why it takes 45 minutes to get that taco. I know it's all made to order but it doesn't seem like a sustainable model. Service is never more than a person taking your order then you never see them again. Bakersfield downtown is cheaper, faster, and awesome."}
{"text":"Very long wait 2.5 hrs after told would be 1.5 hrs.  We arrived at 6:30. Seated at 9. They comped us cheese dip and apologized. That was appreciated but point of going out for me is to spend relaxing time w friends w and having to bar hop in local neighborhood while waiting was frustrating. Plan ahead if you go for this type of arrangement. They are no longer BYB and do not allow guests to wait at their bar. You can order drinks while waiting in the lobby. I'm not a drinker and appetizers while waiting are not an option.  Menu is limited to tacos and sides. Cash only. What they offer is good. I would not say amazing but somewhat unique. Nice vegetarian selection. They have corn tortillas avail upon request of you are gluten free. The apple slaw very good and meatloaf taco special really interesting mix of flavors. One of our friends from NY commented atmosphere kinda like a Brooklyn skit. If you enjoy trendy place to explore may enjoy.  In the end not worth the wait for me but w right timing and plan may work for you."}
{"text":"I did really like this place, but the last two times I tried to go there for lunch before shopping at the Waterfront, they were closed. They've reduced their hours so much they might as well give up. I won't even try again."}
{"text":"Best hidden gem in Pittsburgh.   I have never had such incredible tasting tacos, especially their pork cheek that they had on special last time... Not to mention their mac and cheese - absolutely mind blowing!  Favorite place for a really cool atmosphere and even better food. If you haven't gone yet, go NOW!"}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of smoke until the relocation. 
We waited for over 2 hours to be seated, and another hour for the food to arrive.  
They were out of ribs and chicken...and the tacos that WERE available were mediocre when compared to the excellence I'd come to enjoy at the original spot.  
The music was unbearably loud.  Screaming your conversation = no bueno.
It was FREEZING in there.  It's hard to enjoy a meal when your feet are numb.  They made it seem that the heating problem was not worth the money required to fix it...

Maybe when the weather breaks and they get their act together in the kitchen, it'll be better.   For now though, they'll be leaving a lot of loyal customers unsatisfied."}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side, since I'm used to an abundance of yummy tacos in LA and Texas, but good flavor in both the tacos we tried and the best place we've found so far for tacos in Pittsburgh.

We only tried two tacos and took them to go, so there's not much else for me to review at this time.  But, we're definitely going to go back to try some more things, so an update will definitely be added."}
{"text":"I've been eating tacos from Smoke on a fairly regular basis since a few weeks after they opened, and there's a reason. All of the staff are incredibly friendly, the atmosphere is great (especially now that they have more than three tables in the restaurant!), and (most importantly) the food is *amazing*.

Now, I feel like there's two distinct types of restaurants that I expected Smoke to fall into when first visiting - the cheap-but-authentic-and-delicious category (Reyna's is my go-to for this), or the lets-try-something-new-and-its-amazing category. This restaurant definitely fits the latter, and does so extremely well. My typical order here is the Chicken Apple Bacon taco and a BLT taco - one of each is definitely enough to fill me up. It's not your traditional Mexican fare, but don't worry - it's unique, and it's awesome. The freshness of the ingredients is readily apparent, with homemade tortillas and the restaurant often smelling of various delicious smoked meat aromas at lunchtime.

Be sure to check their Facebook page before going, or at least ask about the specials once you're at the restaurant. There's some pretty interesting and delicious things they come up with here that they'll offer for a limited time.

If I had to find just one fault, it would probably be the prices, but this is definitely an instance of paying for quality and it's certainly not worth taking stars off over. My order of two tacos plus a horchata comes out over $10, and the restaurant does have a cash-only policy (they've installed an ATM on site if you don't have cash on hand).

One last tip - if you're on a schedule (as I often am, driving here on my lunch break), they do take orders over the phone and via email. Going in to sit down has taken quite some time in the past, but I don't fault them for it... this place gets busy, and that's for a reason."}
{"text":"I like this place. The waitstaff was incredibly friendly and checked in often. The space has some funky details. The duck quesadilla was terrific. As well was the pork taco. The queso was so-so. Definitely going back. The best place to eat when going to a movie at the waterfront. BYOB."}
{"text":"My first experience was good. The food was above average, but the wait time was pretty long. Went for a 2nd visit for lunch today and ordered two tacos but had to leave before eating, because the order still hadn't come after 35 minutes! 

The waitress wasn't very nice when asked about the delay in serving my order. The place was only half full. Maybe others have had the same experience I had and made the same decision not to go back"}
{"text":"Met friends on a weeknight and arrived at 6:30pm.  We got a table no problem but this place fills up fast.  BYOB per person corkage fee.  The menu has soft tacos you have never dreamed of so keep an open mind.  Every taco is great and some were downright awesome.  All meats are marinated and smoke on site.  A perfect place for gourmet tacos at an inexpensive price.  Great atmosphere, great music played all night.  Definitely coming back as this place is a gem!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on March 18th.  A little difficult to find, but worth it!  Waitress was friendly and attentive.  Food was great.

Chips were out of this world.  Queso was amazing as well.  Table next to us saw us chowing down so they ordered the same.

We both ordered veg tacos.  I added brisket.  It was good.

Cannot wait to go back to try more!"}
{"text":"Great, great, GREAT food!  

The macaroni and cheese is evil and must be eaten quickly so it does not take over the world.  Oh it is SO good!  I've had the brisket taco, the rib taco, the wings that are only available Thursdays, and the queso with chorizo.  I would order and enjoy everything again.  Great little gem by the Waterfront."}
{"text":"Food, so good. It's tiny and they need more tables but they found us room and it was delicious. We shall return. And BYOB too. Everything we had was delicious, the environment was fun, and the staff was real friendly and a delight to be with. I definitely recommend this place to all."}
{"text":"So good.  The staff is nice and friendly and the restaurant is BYOB.  There is a beer shop on the other side of the movie theater.  
They use an ipad wait list and you get a text when your table is ready.  We waited just long enough to pick out some beers.  The waitstaff uses iphones to take orders and it goes directly to the point of sales system and to the kitchen.  Very efficient.  The weird part is that they don't take cards.  They are very high-tech, but they don't take cards?  They also don't have a website.  They rely on a stinkin' Facebook page.  And Google Plus (?!)  I don't know if they are working on these things. 
Also: it's pretty loud.  Not a great place for a first date."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a transitional neighborhood, one blink and you could miss it.  Once you step inside the aromas will draw you in.  The service can be slow, so allow yourself some extra time.  Don't forget to bring cash, because they do not accept credit cards.  The mac and cheese is a standout, and tastes even better reheated!  Vegetarian options do exist, and they are quite flavorful.  This would make a great addition to Lawrenceville!"}
{"text":"very cool atmosphere and service was good. Really want to like this place but the food  was confusing. Queso Dip was quite good but their chips were like fried pita or something....not good. A taco place with no salsa or quac? The tacos themselves were large portions of a meat, covered in sauce, placed in a flour tortilla, and wrapped in aluminum foil....this was dine in. 

The place is trying and Pittsburgh needs a good taco joint, bbq too, and they have everything but the food right now. Will try it again to support their effort and hope to like the food more."}
{"text":"This place is such a great palace! It is not really a kid-friendly place but it's still a great place out to eat. I am not a salad person but the beef hash salad was delicious and I ate it all! Great Place!"}
{"text":"The speed of the service at this place can really not be understated.  I need to say right off the bat that we ordered two (tiny) tacos and two bowls of chili and it took us OVER AN HOUR to get our food. 

That aside, the food was really good.  I got the chicken taco, my husband got the brisket. My taco was mostly meat, with very minimal other toppings.  The meat was good, but I would have liked to have had more of the other stuff that was in the taco (apple, bacon, a chipotle mayo).  They make their own flour tortillas, which really made a bigger difference than I was anticipating.  They were really light and tender. The chili was also really good.  It had bits of the brisket mixed in which made it really smokey and filling.

I really do have to go back to this slow service thing, though, because it blew my mind.  We are taking about tacos and chili here..  how can that possible take an hour to make?  I feel like they make every tiny portion of chili from scratch when it is ordered instead of having a big pot of it ready to go.  And the tacos?  Seriously?  Have they seen other people make a taco before?  You should have the stuff ready and then you just put it together!  

The other huge issue with this place was the seating.  When we walked in, all three tables were taken.  The bar had two people sitting at it with loads of other room, but there were no chairs.  There was also plenty of room for more tables.  Anyway we said we could just sit at the bar if they had some more stools.. the girl brought us two low stools that were clearly intended for a table, and not a bar, and so we sat with the bar at about nose-height.  

The reason that these things were so frustrating is that they seemed SO easily remedied!  Buy a couple of stools!  Get a couple more thrift store tables (the other ones in the place didn't match, so I just can't understand why they didn't invest another $10 in another table!)  Have the chili prepared!  Have the meats for the tacos prepared!  

I understand that this place is new-ish.. they obviously have a few kinks to work out. I think if they can get it figured out they will be in good shape because, like I said, the food was really fantastic.

Oh and also- like everywhere else in Pittsburgh, its cash only, so come prepared for that."}
{"text":"Atmosphere - kinda weird, really bad use of space, but I like the overall vibe. They need to get a liquor license and put up a proper bar or put stools on the other side of the table. The 2 huge tables are a colossal waste of space and can make for some weird seating arrangements and insane wait times. We saw a lot of people order take-out and it makes sense.

Service - good. Everyone who works there seems to be genuinely enthusiastic about the food. The entrees come out a little slow but its generally worth it. 

Food - good. I think it is crazy but awesome to use wagyu beef and berkshire pork. However, it tends not to show so much in the food because of the tex-mex style tends to hide low and high points with the ingredients. I'm sure if they offered straight up barbecue it would be amazing. All the agua fresca drinks we have had were awesome. I'm a fan of the frito pie and the mac and cheese, but they aren't for everyone. The potato salad was unexpectedly good with those homemade bacon bits. 

Other stuff - Call before you go if it's getting late to see if they are open. It's 2012, they should take credit cards."}
{"text":"The service was so great! Our waitress was so helpful. She curated to what I was looking for and gave amazing suggestions. Great vibe, service and food."}
{"text":"It was a little bit difficult to find. For those searching: it's the door directly to the left of the Rowhouse Theatre.

Otherwise the experience was excellent. My friends got there around 5pm on a Thursday and by the time I joined them at 5:15 they had been seated. We ordered shortly after and our food arrived in a very timely manner. I'd say we probably only waited 25 mins at the most, for 5 people to be served. Our server was nice and very helpful.

The queso and homemade chips are delicious. Everyone had great things to say about their tacos. My veggie tacos were yummy, and I think the prices are appropriate. Next time I'd like to try the brisket or chicken tacos to actually get a feel for their smoked meat. 

It was a little bit chilly in there, so bring a sweater. Also, will be nice when they serve corn tortillas with their tacos - I asked the server and he said it's on the agenda. I'm sure the gluten-free folks out there will be appreciative. 

Overall - we all enjoyed our meals and the atmosphere, and will be returning."}
{"text":"Lawrenceville. Hipster capitol USA. This area produces more beards, hats and casual shoes per capita than the entire gross domestic product of Zimbabwe. Needless to say I continued on. Smoke doesn't really have a sign on their establishment (and if there is one, than holy christ, it's camouflaged better than the Predator during peak hunting season). It's just there. If you aren't paying attention you'll walk right past it and into the cinema next door. 
Now I have stumbled upon something amazing. It should be a discovery or some sort of anomaly only seen in some demented parallel universe. I'm not talking about the food. The food was actually pretty good. Friends, I come to you here and now in the year of our Lord two thousand and seventeen to discuss the waiting you will do at this restaurant. Yes, the waiting. In fact, if you are reading this there is an 80% likelihood that you are waiting to be seated at Smoke whilest standing in Industry Public House. Take a moment and let your brain process that. Yes, waiting in Industry to be seated at Smoke. This type of waiting goes beyond anything our civilization has seen. As I stood there I knew I was on a precipice of discovering the next common cliche. They give out noble peace prizes for these types of discoveries, I thought. Like some sort of tear in the fabric of space time, or discovering a new element in the periodic table, or experiencing deja vu in the Matrix. The waiting you do at doctors offices don't hold a candle to this place. It must be some sort of speak easy type of thing that only hipsters in Lawrenceville are privy to. I felt like an outsider having walked up and asked for a table when I should have, in reality, called 6 hours in advance. The brevity of the situation began to sink in. I thought to myself, who was I to have walked with an air of facking nonchalance to this place and asked for a table. 40 minutes turned to an hour, an hour turned to an 1 hour and 20 minutes. Time began to slow down. I witnessed the birth of the universe. It was only a Friday night, not Saturday but Friday. The yuppy crowd was long gone. It's closer now, I thought. Just a little longer, you are almost there. 2 hours passed and nothing. Even as I'm writing this I feel as though a part of me is still there at Smoke. I have to go back and rescue my memory that still lingers there. Dumbledore probably has it in a vile somewhere. Why is the wait time to be seated so long? It's tacos, people. You arent being served a 7 course meal. Are they hammering their own corn in the the back and making tortillas from scratch? That must be it. That's the answer I will give myself so I can sleep tonight."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed this place!  BYOB which is always a plus.   It's an adorable and small place in Homestead outside of the waterfront. 

The mac and cheese was delicious, as what the pork taco I got. Helpful server... overall good experience."}
{"text":"Oh Smoke! Your food is a 5. If only the way you managed the restaurant volume could keep up. We live a block away so we stop in frequently but usually get quoted a 1 1/2 to 2 hour wait. Fine, so we'll go on Saturday for lunch, we decide. Today, there was plenty of room but the host warned us that the kitchen was really backed up-- so much so that maybe we would like to come another time. 

I appreciate the restaurant's popularity and the fact that they take the time they need to make great tacos. But at this point, we've written off Smoke because it's so hard to reasonably get in."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Work in the waterfront and have been meaning to go here.  Finally did today... and I am very mad that I have waited so long.  Chicken and Pork tacos were both had incredible flavor, and tortillas were obviously fresh.  Pineapple Agua Fresca was perfect."}
{"text":"I love Smoke! It has become one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. The food is inexpensive and so tasty. The egg taco is especially good. Seriously, go to Smoke and support a great local business. So good."}
{"text":"Food: There are multiple tacos to choose from, including beef, chicken, veggie, and more.  The tacos aren't huge (but are cheap, see below), and two tacos and an appetizer or three tacos on their own will likely be enough to fill you.  The appetizers are fairly small, and won't fill you up before you get to the tacos.  We ordered the homemade mac and cheese and the apple slaw, both of which were good.  The veggie tacos are filled with fresh veggies and are above average, however, I think Smoke is more suited for carnivores.  The non-veggie tacos seem to be what draw the crowd.

Price: The prices are very reasonable, most tacos are $3, and both appetizers we ordered were $2.50 each.  Neither the tacos nor the appetizers are huge, and you won't have any to take home, but you can eat your fill for well under $15, maybe under $10.  Cash only.

Drinks: BYOB.  Multiple tables had six packs on the table with their dinner.  Smoke makes their own version of flavored water that rotates daily or weekly.  This earned rave reviews, and it is good, but nothing spectacular.  It was Honeydew flavor when we were there.

Atmosphere: Located right on 8th Ave. (the main drag of Homestead) near the Valero station, you may miss it if you don't look closely.  It feels like a smoke house, starting as you walk through the screen door and into the strange old-fashioned interior.  You seat yourself, and there aren't many tables, but you can move them however you want to accommodate your group.  The entire dining experience is very casual.  There are no plates; your tacos come wrapped in aluminum foil, and the appetizers come in coffee cups.

Service: The service was quick and friendly, and we had no complains at all.  Our waitress came to our table right away, asked if we had been there before, and filled us in on what we needed to know as first-time-diners.  She checked back on us multiple times.

(+): above average authentic food, great price

(-): for vegetarians the food is good but not great

Would I go back again? I probably wouldn't make the trip to Homestead just to eat here, but if I was at the Waterfront and didn't want to wait to eat at one of the chain restaurants, I'd definitely pop in for a cheap lunch."}
{"text":"We had a rib taco, a chicken taco, and two breakfast tacos. Really good! I think the egg breakfast taco was the best. I would really recommend this place above anything on the main drag of Waterfront Dr."}
{"text":"Long wait. We're told 45 to 55 minutes. Waited 1 hour 10 minutes. Very noisy. The food was ok. A little pricey. 12$ for a peach cobbler is crazy. 4 tacos, 2 appetizers and 2 ice teas with tip 75$"}
{"text":"This a cute little restaurant in Homestead started by a couple from Austin. Nelda is an amazing hostess, she makes you feel really welcome and is very passionate about the place. The food is amazing, great great flavors! I have always been a fan of tacos, but these tacos are something else. They have great combinations of flavors which I really enjoy. The menu is not super long but has something for everyone. I can't pick a favorite taco, I enjoy them all. And along with my delicious tacos, I love to have a glass of the agua fresca of the day. I love the sprinkle of lemon on the top. These guys are pros!"}
{"text":"I am pretty sure the queso dip is made from unicorn horns and daydreams.  

I've had a few of the tacos, and found the veggie to be my favorite, overall.  Rumor has it that this week they are featuring a chicken and waffle taco...I don't know who is in charge over there, but I am convinced they fell straight from heaven."}
{"text":"I love this place. But note, the hours have changed and they are now closed Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday."}
{"text":"TL;DR - The food was delicious, but the menu is a la carte and expensive. CASH ONLY!

This was my first time at Smoke BBQ Taqueria.  We went for a late lunch around 1:15PM on a Saturday, and waited about 20 minutes for a table.  The host provided us with our first round while we waited.  Unfortunately, the kitchen had run out of chicken by the time we sat.

Three of us shared the queso with chorizo which matched very nicely with what appeared to be pita chips made in house.  We each ordered two tacos (they're priced individually).  The waitress seemed to think we weren't ordering enough food, but we all ended up leaving with leftovers.  1 bloody mary, 3 beers, 5 tacos and queso w/ chorizo ended up being 88$ with 14$ tip.

I had the brisket and ribs, and I also tried a bite of the pork, and they were all delicious.  The brisket was by far my favorite.

The drawbacks of this restaurant are essentially its pretentiousness and subsequent high cost.  Our service was fair, but not up to par for the pricing of the food."}
{"text":"I love tacos. I love barbecue. I do not really like this place. The tacos had way too much meat in them making them so heavy and just tasting of meat. If you like tacos that are essentially a barbecue sandwich with no sauce in a tortilla then maybe you would like it. I would have preferred barbecue or tacos. That said the queso was delicious. Being cash only was also inconvenient."}
{"text":"Very impressive. Tacos were delicious. The mac n cheese was possibly the best ive had in a long time. My head almost exploded."}
{"text":"The best tacos in Pittsburgh.  I've eaten here once a week since they opened, I seriously can't get enough."}
{"text":"The chips and queso are the best I've ever had! They're pita chips that are crispy on the outside but soft on the inside and salted perfectly.  The tacos were just ok. I feel as if the flavors didn't mesh as well as they sounded. Mac and cheese was great but when ISNT Mac and cheese delicious?

I don't understand the cash only policy for a place that gets enough business to subsist and the seating is so strangely organized. 

I think this restaurant gets such amazing reviews because Pittsburgh is severely lacking in two main food areas: Barbeque and Mexican food. This place tries to combine both with the hippest atmosphere they could possibly muster in Lawrenceville. All of this comes together for a very pretentious dining experience.

Overall, there is basically no restaurant in Pittsburgh that I would wait 2 hours for. There are many other options to eat around that area. I will probably only get take-out in the future."}
{"text":"Prices have gone from $4.75 & up for one taco to $6 & up. Not worth it. Go to Las Palmas or Doce instead."}
{"text":"Five stars for the food, zero stars for the agonizingly slow service.

I read on Yelp and elsewhere that getting food at Smoke could take a while, so I called ahead to place my order. I arrived about 25 minutes later and was told that my order was not ready. From that point I had to wait another 45 minutes before my food started coming out. Tacos are basically fast food; I can't even fathom what could have taken so long. The place was not particularly busy. Do they smoke each little portion of meat individually? I don't get it.

The tacos were excellent, especially as I was ravenously hungry after my 70 minute wait. I tried the veggie, pork, brisket, and breakfast with chorizo (they were out of ribs and chicken). Only the veggie taco left something to be desired, i.e. meat. The other three were delicious, especially the brisket and breakfast.

I will definitely patronize Smoke again, but I will make sure to call an hour ahead next time. I hope they use some of my money to hire some additional help."}
{"text":"smoke.....taco's....yeah i don't get it ..... but there seems to be some kink in this town for boring one word one syllable restaurant titles. If you're into overpriced mediocrity in the form of a \"taco\" this might be your thing. If you ever wondered what it would be like to have someone chew up food and spit it into a skimpy foil clad corn tortilla and then eat it then this is really going to be you thing. so going with the one word syllable theme i would sum it up like this

Bland. Sad. Lots. Of. Hot. Canned. Corn."}
{"text":"Second time here, and I just felt like the servers weren't very friendly. Took a long time to get menus and the fact that it's cash only and they do not split checks is really inconvenient.

I had the chicken taco with avocado cream and it didn't taste like much. The food is just okay. I enjoyed the mac and cheese and broccolini sides - but for the price I doubt I will return."}
{"text":"The macaroni was good. I am not familiar with this style of taqueria, but I would come back to try other things for sure. I enjoyed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tacos! The chicken and the fish tacos were both excellent. I typically hate onions, but I absolutely love the way the onions were prepared at Smoke. This is hands down my go-to taco place in Pittsburgh. Service is very relaxed and friendly as well. 

Definitely try the horchata if you're here!"}
{"text":"The hipster approach to dining at Smoke is a little much for me.  They don't take reservations, but you can call ahead (and they ask you if you've called ahead).  I prefer a restaurant that either takes reservations, or doesn't.  It's also cash-only.  

Prices were a little high on extras.  I couldn't tell that there was avocado cream on my tacos at all, and I paid more for it.  The chorizo tacos were insanely spicy.  I expected heat and I love chorizo, but they were inedible.  However, the broccolini and corn was delicious.  The queso was tasty too.  

In terms of drinks, they certainly put thought into pairings.  It's great for IPA and stout drinkers, but I'm not a fan and it would have been nice to have one lager or wheat beer available."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  My husband frequented the location in Homestead before it moved to Lawrenceville, and kept telling me, \"I have to take you to this place.  It isn't typical barbecue.\"  (I'm not a big fan of barbecue.)  We went to Smoke on Butler Street and it was out-of-this-world good and reasonably priced.  The inside has very cool urban decor, too.  Run, don't walk to Smoke BBQ Taqueria!"}
{"text":"Love the food, drinks and owners. The menu is very creative. Combining BBQ with tacos is both of my favorites in one meal. Gotta love it. My daughter and I made the trip from the North Hills area and found parking right in front. The lemonade is amazing. We wanted to try everything. We even ordered a couple for my wife to go. We will eat here when we go to the Waterfront or Kennywood or even just as a destination to eat period. Yum..."}
{"text":"Before I ate at Smoke, I always felt estranged from those who had horrible restaurant experiences.  Needless to say, that all changed tonight.   My wife and I put our name in at about 7 o'clock.  We were told the wait would be about an hour and half.  To our misguided surprise, about an hour later, we were contacted, telling us that our table was ready.  We quickly closed-out at the adjacent bar.  When we arrived for Table the hostess conveyed that, for some reason, seemingly beyond his control, the message was improperly  sent out and that our table would not be ready for another half hour.  

Not taking this as a sign, which we would both later deeply regret, my wife and I came back after 45 minutes for a table.   

After sitting down, it took about 25 minutes for a waiter  to come over.  From this point on, we might as well have been dining in purgatory.  After an hour of asking where our food was, we were told that it would be coming shortly.

So as to avoid wasting your time in any way similar to the time the staff at Smoke wasted mine; after 45 more minutes we were finally served with our food.    

We didn't receive the appetizer we ordered and the food was cold.

For all of our trouble we were told that we would be compensated...

We received a 20% discount, and get this, a 15% coupon off our next visit.    

It turns out that Smoke is not only incapable of giving good service, but also thinks that recipients of said service are stupid enough to return."}
{"text":"Here's the deal:

(1) The wait can be a bit long. Call ahead. The wait for food can be long too.

(2) They aren't really tacos. It's basically awesome meat wrap in a flour tortilla.

(3) The music is too loud.

(4) The mac and cheese is flavorful but nothing special. Definitely not worth $7.50"}
{"text":"Awesomely industrial looking place!!!!!!!  Went there couple nights ago with a buddy who also loves tacos.   I will go back for sure, maybe even later today!"}
{"text":"What a place.  This is NOT your standard taco joint.  Bring tequila and they'll supply you their special margarita mix.  Apple chicken my favorite.  Wings on Thursday - DO IT.  Also Mac and Cheese.  YUM."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 tacos and 2 sides ( slaw and mac) for takeout and the bill came to $40. For that price I was expecting enough food for a family of 4...however, taco's contained nothing but 2 ounces of greasy meat (no veggies or fresh cilantro or sauce of any kind) and, to add insult to injury, the \"smoke\" flavor tasted like it came out of a bottle. The slaw was several days old and tasted of refrigerator and the mac was bland and pasty (but the only thing that was even remotely edible). If I could give this place negative stars, I would."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try on the night on the RANT festival. It was very crowded and we had an hour wait for a seat at the bar--not sure if this is typical or if there was extra crowd from the music fest in Lawrenceville. Either way, it was quite loud and bustling. However, we had prompt service considering the full house.

The ambiance is dim and trendy with lots of exposed brick and wood.

The tacos were unique and very tasty! Wish I would have gotten two or at least a larger taco for the price though.

The drinks were unique and refreshing--we had the Horchata and Aquas Frescas. 

Overall, I would love to go back when it is a little quieter. Very good food that is a little pricey for the portion size, but worth it and on-par prices with comparable restaurants in Lawrenceville."}
{"text":"Decent food. Great service. Menu is hit or miss depending on the day you go. Great idea but inconsistent food."}
{"text":"I was vegan. Then I came to smoke. I love smoke!! I wish I could do more than just keep going back to show my appriciation. So here I am writing a review! I hope you go there! All the staff if really cool and stellar atmosphere."}
{"text":"Don't worry, whatever you choose on the menu will be delicious. I'm not kidding. I've tried almost all of it. And never disappointed. How often does that happen? Not frequently. And yes they are no longer BYOB, but since they started serving alcohol, they've always had shorter, but excellent selection of beers. They keep it simple and great like many other success stories."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try Smoke. I love smoked meats and tacos?! Yum! We went on a Tuesday evening, which I did not know means \"burger night.\" I was still looking forward to my meal, even though it wasn't going to be tacos. Cheeseburgers are actually my favorite food. Unfortunately, we were very dissatisfied with our meal. The flavor was mediocre. It smelled great in the restaurant. However, there was about a half a cup of grease that leaked onto the dish and about a half a cup that entered my gut from the burger. The fries were yummy, but they were soaked in vinegar which did not sit well with the aforementioned grease. My fiancé and I were both sick from the grease the next day (and believe me I have had my fair share of bloody burgers-it was not because of an intolerance to red meat). There is also very very limited ability to customize the burger. There's basically only one option and it's not at all worth the $14 dollars they charge. Also, it was very very loud inside. We could barely talk because the music was playing so loudly. 

Overall I rated it two stars because I HOPE their tacos are better than their burgers. I am giving this place the benefit of the doubt. Avoid Tuesday's though."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant in or around Pittsburgh right now, certainly for the price. But it's too bad they aren't especially veg. friendly, bc that means I can only ever go by myself.  Anything with their house made bacon in it is amazing. Pinto beans and potato salad are my favorite sides. Rib and brisket are my favorite tacos. Spread the word. No one in Pgh is doing BBQ this well."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The brisket taco is the best I have ever had. Homemade flour torts insanely good. My wife loved the pork taco. Fresh ingredients, homemade not processed = great end product!!!!! For the complaints of slow service we waited about 20 min for our food and they were bizy. I did not think that was too bad for the best HOMEMADE taco in town!!!!! For those of you who still think that's too long they have a place called taco bell where you pay $1.50 for what looks like beef in 1 min. For me I'll take my fresh made taco with real ingredients."}
{"text":"Short and Sweet- Get anything with Brisket in the meal. We go back and forth between the Mac and Cheese and Tacos. Can't go wrong with either choice!"}
{"text":"This place was hard to find, but worth it. It is located beside Atlas Bottle Works. My husband and I ordered 4 different tacos. The brisket one was spicy, but good. The rib taco was our favorite though. The mac 'n cheese was amazing. Prices aren't cheap, but I don't mind paying for good food."}
{"text":"Smoke. I love you.

The smoked chicken tacos were perfectly tender and surprisingly flavorful, and the horchata is TO DIE FOR. If you like horchata, you need to order it here!

A cool place with a cool vibe and cool servers that have beards. What more can you want."}
{"text":"The best smoked meats and chipotle sauces I have ever seen in any Mexican food restaurant. I loved the 2 types of tacos I tried, and the dip as an appetizer. The cocktails and beers are mostly locally crafted, and really a good selection.

The chicke taco is a favorite, I liked the vegetarian one as well with the chipotle sauce and love anything with poblano's. This is an excellent stop!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable and everything is so good! I have yet to be disappointed, in fact I'm here for the second time in a week I love it so much!!  The food takes a LONG time though, because it is so fresh.  The drinks are slightly overpriced, but overall it is great!!"}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable prices and nice ambiance. We went on a Wed. at 6:30 and had no problem getting a table. We ordered queso which was really good. The taco I had was very good and the wait staff was nice and attentive. It is also great that you can grab beers next door!"}
{"text":"Real mexican food in the Pittsburgh area! Ah! I feel in love the minute I saw special agua frescas on the menu. And extra points goes to Smoke for moving into a neighborhood that is trying to revitalize itself. Do yourself, Smoke owners, AND Homestead a favor, try not to be a food snob, and try some amazing tacos!"}
{"text":"I was all about the hype of this restaurant and the location is great and the inside of the restaurant is really nice. However, the cost for these tacos is a bit pricey for what you get. The brisket taco is good, but not $7 good. The amount of brisket was a tiny quantity. The mac and cheese was decent but very rich-so make sure to share with at least 2-3 others. Ended up spending $38 for four tacos and mac&cheese. Not too impressed with that and felt my money could have been spent elsewhere for higher quality food. It was nice to come during a weekday for lunch and not have to wait at all. I couldn't see myself waiting longer than 15 minutes here during a busy time at the restaurant. Service was fast and adequate-food came out in less than ten minutes.  Also, the music the restaurant had playing was sooo loud during lunch and there were only three other occupied tables at this time. Oh and remember-cash only!"}
{"text":"Would be 5 star review bc the food is THAT good. But, this has been a favorite BYOB place for us and when we went out of our way to fill up our growler to go with our tacos, we found out it's not BYOB anymore. I understand they expanded to have a full bar. but if you open as BYOB and are BYOB for as long as they were, it's pretty messed up to just take it away. My mistake, it's not gone. It's a $15 corking fee. No thanks. Oh and desert is isn't everyday. What the heck is that!!??? We won't be coming back as often."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Smoke. I loved their food when they were in Homestead and eagerly awaited their opening in Lawrenceville.

So, it took me 4 tries before I could even get some food to eat. The first time they ran out of food during a street festival. Totally understandable. The second time I stopped by on a Friday night around 6:30 and told that they were no longer seating for the night. Ok, it was a weekend night and there's a lot of hype surrounding this place so I get it. Would have been nice if they had a sign on the door so I didn't have to wait in line to be turned away. The third time I was quoted a 90+ minute wait for dinner and told that they weren't doing take-out. Really, 90 minutes for street food? I decided to try another time.

Finally, on a Sunday at 2pm I called to see if I could get a take-out order. I was quoted 45 minutes and decided to give it a go. However, it took well over 60 minutes to get 4 tacos. The restaurant was only half full, so I couldn't figure out why it would take so long for 4 tacos. I talked with the hostess and confirmed that yes, they do smoke the meats ahead of time. She explained that it takes them 10-15 minutes to prepare an order of 3 tacos and that they prepare orders one at a time; hence, the incredibly long wait time. This truly baffled my mind. How is it that the taco truck can whip out tacos faster than a restaurant with a full kitchen?

The tacos were ok, but definitely not worth waiting over an hour for. The quality has decreased since they were in Homestead. I really hope that they learn how to run their kitchen more efficiently and return to having the quality of tacos that they used to have. I won't be returning unless their service improves and their food quality returns to what it was at their previous location. Not worth a visit now."}
{"text":"As long as you don't mind horrible, ignorant service at the hostess stand -proceed.  Food is fantastic.  However, it is not that good to be treated the way I witnessed they treated several customers tonight.  After waiting for an hour and seeing we still had 8 people in front of us, we decided to get it to go.  Told it would be another 1/2 hr and would get texted when our food was ready.  After 1/2 hr and no text, decided to check status only to find our food had been bagged and lukewarm because they were too busy to text.  Saw other people miss the text message and were told that because they didn't come, they'd be put on bottom of the list.  With great restaurants popping up all over the area, if this service keeps up pretty soon you won't have to wait long at all to sit down because people will have chosen to go elsewhere like I will probably next time I am craving a decent taco."}
{"text":"This is one of mine and my husbands favorite restaurants. We've been for both dinner and brunch. The food is constant and delicious. You get a full size taco when you order and they are amazing. The queso and chips are the best this city has to offer and their brunch has a lot of amazing delicious options. Make sure you get there house made margarita when you order!"}
{"text":"Decided to try out Smoke last night on a whim with the husband and I was not disappointed. We started with their special of chicken wings with homemade bleu cheese dressing. The size of the wings were a little small, but they made up for it with flavor. I was expecting a franks type buffalo sauce and instead I was pleasantly surprised with an almost tomato spicy sauce. The bleu cheese dressing was obviously homemade and delicious.
We continued to order our tacos, we did the egg, chicken, rib, and chorizo. Egg and chorizo would have been perfect for a hangover breakfast. Chicken was great, but that Rib Taco... it was literally the best taco my husband and I have ever had... EVER! Now to ask for $6.50 for a single taco is a pretty high price, therefore setting a high standard. But I would have literally paid upwards of $10 for that taco and it still would've been worth it. We also got the mac-n-cheese and it was delicious as well. It said it used marscapone cheese which gave it almost a light flavor instead of typical heavy mac-n-cheese.
Our service was on point as well. Our server was prompt in checking in, clearing plates, and making sure we needed. At one point I told my husband that I needed more napkins for my wing soaked fingers. About 10 seconds later the other server came by and dropped off more napkins. Now that is good service! She must've overheard me.
The total overall experience was great! The only complaint I would have is that it is BYOB... but hey, a lot of people like that however we are typically cocktail drinkers. Also that it is CASH ONLY. We had cash so it is not a big deal but I think it would be more accommodating if that they would at least give you the option to pay with a card. Two minor things overlooked for that delicious food and prompt service. We will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Okay, so this place has none of the traditional restaurant items such as sodas and Tabasco hot sauce. Everything has a fresh touch to it. They recommended 2 tacos but it was a bit much with the delicious black bean onion dip appetizer. I ate everything though cuz I couldn't stop! Very good!"}
{"text":"Beginning with a truly refreshing watermelon and cucumber drink accompanied by nachos and queso that tasted just made, I then enjoyed the percectly sized blt taco with smoked applewood bacon and just enough spice to not overpower how delicious this combo was. Great brunch spot for those who are just looking for a great meal in a funky hipster setting. I don't drink so it was a perfect spot."}
{"text":"I don't think I paid enough for this experience. Excellent food - medium to high spice, but so any flavors in every bite. I had a special chicken taco with bacon, and the combo of soft and crispy added another dimension.  The 3-pepper lemonade was superb, even sans alcohol. I ate at the bar.  Wait staff was superb. Ambience chill and friendly.  First time in Pittsburgh, and I'm mighty impressed.  Smoke BBQ: how about a franchise in Moscow, ID?"}
{"text":"After living in Austin, TX for a while, I would say my standards for both BBQ and tacos are pretty high. Smoke **just nearly** knocks it out of the park. I've tried several tacos (e.g., chicken, ribs, brisket, migas) and they were all pretty good. The random thing I fell in love with was their sweet tea! So good for being in the north, ya'll! 

I will say on that both visits to Smoke, I encountered some pretty slow service. If you aren't in a hurry or super hungry that's probably not the biggest deal, but don't expect to eat fast."}
{"text":"Update:  They are no longer BYOB and prices have increased.  The tacos are still delicious and large (really enjoyed the migas with burnt ends and the brisket the other day).  However, after a recent visit (and spending 11 bucks on an average cocktail) my overall impression was much less enthusiastic as it had been in the past.  Reminder: It's cash only."}
{"text":"We finally made it to Smoke this past weekend, and it was all amazing. It was a little after noon on Saturday and only waited about 10 minutes for the table. We received some complimentary smoked nuts while we were waiting that were awesome.  They had a nice selection of drafts we both really enjoyed. For food, we ordered a pork taco, the chicken apple taco, some queso with chips, and some burnt ends which were on special. Everything was so good! Their home made flour tortilla chips were so unique and fresh. I loved that they were still a little soft, but very crunchy. Both tacos were so good, as were the burnt ends. I definitely can't wait to get back there to try out more of the menu. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Bangin, 
May prohibition live on.  

Open kitchen, clean food, good service.   

Swag all around."}
{"text":"The tacos were pretty good, although I found the pork and brisket kind to be a bit bland and full of large onion pieces. The queso dip was tasty, but it was served with Fritos which were way too salty and kind of threw it off.  

But I won't return because of the abysmal wait time. The place was virtually empty - I counted a total of ten people when I walked in,but it took well over an hour for them finish my takeout order. There are just so many good restaurants in Pittsburgh, that I can't see myself wasting that much time going to Smoke again. Yo Rita serves similar fare with much better service."}
{"text":"The side dishes are AMAZING!  I would drive an hour to eat here, but am lucky enough to be a 10 minute drive.  Its hard not to get one of everything on the menu"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, and queso dip was to die for! We definitely felt out of place not being hipsters, but overall a good place to stop for lunch. Bring cash!"}
{"text":"Out of 5:

1.5 - ribs taco: smothered in too much sauce
2.5 - chicken taco: very spicy
2.5 - duck quesadilla 

1.5 - Value: small proportions, especially the \"to share - or NOT to share\", which are kind of impossible to share.

If you want good tacos, also give Las Palmas Carniceria a shot."}
{"text":"Made a reservation, was seated 30 minutes late. Waited 15 minutes for a server. Got the rib plate, dry on the inside and greasy on the outside. Also was scolded for looking at the gluten free menu for some reason. But that's ok not going back. Thanks I see why you are one of the lower reviewed establishments in the city. I'll do my part as well in contributing to that."}
{"text":"Stopped again today for lunch.   Had the chicken and brisket tacos.   (I was smart enough to order one of each!)   Excellent!"}
{"text":"I tried this place a few times. The food is decent but nothing worth waiting for. It is bland and needs spice added. I had the rib taco the brisket and the chicken Apple taco.  I also had the queso chips. 

First the service is horrible. They seem pompous and after the first time I didn't want to go back. They just reopened when I went so I did give them another chance. I shouldn't have. I even went for take out and asked if I could order and pick it up in 2 hours because they were busy they wouldn't take an order they couldn't make 3 tacos in 2 hours ridiculous. The attitude from the host was enough to not want to go back. The time I did sit to eat the wait for the food took an hour to get to us. The meat just needs cut how long can that take. 

The meat was  cooked well but lacked flavor. The chips were good and fresh, but the queso cheese needs some flavor. 

Over all bland food and rude staff not worth the wait."}
{"text":"The tacos are outstanding. I ordered the chicken and apple after reading reviews on its awesomeness. I was not disappointed! It was delicious. I also ordered the pork taco, equally fantastic. My friends got the veggie and rib and loved them. There were 3 of us and we ordered the Mac and Cheese (again after reading reviews) and it was some of the best Mac and cheese I have ever had. The portions were good, the taste was great and the customer service was perfect! It's a tiny place so plan on waiting and/or sharing a table to get in faster. We were told 40 mins and the hostess recommended the bar across the street and even called me when our table was ready! I almost forget one of the best parts! It is all affordable and it's byob so you save $ that way as well. I spent $18 total for a wonderful meal. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A 15221-MUST. Smoke BBQ marries authentic n fresh tortillas to modern creativity. Wear your white cause this wedding is the bees knees

Walked twice past the nondescript door beckoned.. but don't just open! Pause at the threshold. Empty those lungs. Anticipate. Then open that door and BREATHE!

Rich smoke fills your nose as you take in the decor: brick, wood, people.. tight space and full at 2pm on Saturday. Expect a wait. Don't expect a bar seat--there are only 12. Plenty of glassware and a hop-driven tap list. Only bar-complaint is the lack of foot rail.

The tacos were quoted 30 minutes and took 31; it's not Taco Bell..

1) Chicken apple - borders on chicken Waldorf, refreshing!. Boosted by salty bacon and light heat. Juicy chicken is slightly pink.. Excellent! Candidate for a top 5 taco!

2) Wagyu brisket - lightly dry but nice char, peppery spicing. Acid in good doses from the peppers and spiciest of the three. Very solid.

3) Pork - dull flour tortilla. Subtle spice in salsa, onions add tang, but overall bland. Pork is the highlight but too dry. The worst of the three, will skip next time."}
{"text":"Three instead of four stars for a couple reasons... One- too long of a wait. Tacos are great but the two hour wait is a little too much. But I do understand why... With so few good places to eat, that's why you wait! Service- waited two hours, ate dinner, had $100 in cocktails during that hour, and they shoved the check in our face so they could close and we were not the only table left. We would have had another drink. Our bill was around $150 for four. I will say their gin and tonic cocktail w/ St. Germaine is really good."}
{"text":"Smoke is quite tasty, but it's a huge bummer that they do not accept anything but cash.  Don't hippies like to use square anyways?  Regardless, I could eat there daily...multiple times a day.  Get the chorizo tacos...mmm mmm mmm.  Hopefully they enjoy lots of success and move to a nice part of town soon!"}
{"text":"I love their food, since we first been to their place back in Homestead.
Their tacos are awesome, so is the queso dip and mac and cheese.
I just went back a few weeks ago and they now have an increased menu with a lot of BBQ options, that said I had the brisket which was delicious and absolutely like Texas BBQ quality! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh! It is a unique menu and reasonably priced, making it a go to dinner spot.

While I've never disliked anything I've ordered, my go-to order is the Pork taco (w/ caramelized onions and habanero sauce), Egg taco (w/ potato nuggets, beans, and cheese), and the Mac & Cheese. Two tacos is enough to fill me up, but the Mac & Cheese is probably my all-time favorite version of it and makes a great shared side dish. Also, be aware of their interesting specials! From pies to doughnuts or burgers, it always is delicious. 

My one critique of Smoke is that the service can be quite slow. Don't be surprised if it takes 45-60 minutes for your food to be served. I'd consider the wait worth it (especially now that they serve alcohol!) but it seems to contribute to their lengthy table wait time."}
{"text":"We had six people going there on Saturday without making a reservation. We chose to sit at the bar and it took 45 mins to wait for it. The restaurant opens only 4 days from Thur-Sun. So it's quite crowded. I recommend to make a reservation in advance. The restaurant is BYOB, having a shared fridge for cooling your drink. About food, they are real good, but you need to wait quite long. They serve wings only on Thurs. If you want to try new thing, beside mac&cheese, which is pretty good, I recommend duck quesadilla."}
{"text":"Wanted to eat around 730 and had been turned away in the past when they were busy. Called at 530, but they don't take reservations.  They instructed us to call back later to be put on the wait list. Had to call back about 3 times to try and get on the wait list to eat around 730. Finally made a call at 630, and they said it would be about an hour wait. Perfect! Except they called shortly after to say they had an opening and we should head down now.

When we did get there, our table was ready! The food was great, but not 100 percent sure why it's tacos. Could just be awesome smoked meat."}
{"text":"As a born-and-raised Texan, here is the highest praise I can give without hyperbole: Smoke makes hands down the best tacos I have ever had, anywhere. Yes, you heard me: a little taco joint in Pittsburgh, PA makes better tacos than I have ever had in thirty years of living in Texas, Mexico and California. It's all of the flavors of Texas BBQ and Tex-Mex combined and executed in a way that actually surpasses the real deal. If Smoke were to open up a location off East 6th Street in Austin, they would have lines out the door in the first week. It's that good.

In my mind, there are three 'staple' items on the menu: the brisket taco, the pork taco, and the ribs taco. Each brings unique flavors and varying amounts of heat, but the meat in each taco is consistently smoked to perfection in a way that could go head-to-head with any of the best BBQ in Texas. The house-made sauces and fresh toppings perfectly accent the flavors in the meat, and they're wrapped up in some of the best hand-made flour tortillas I've ever had. Some people complain that their tacos are expensive, but in my mind they are worth every penny because every menu item is made from scratch (and they taste like it.)

Their other menu items range from superb -- the daily aguafrescas, their \"available if we made some that day\" desserts and the Thursday-only hot wings -- to the occasional special that misses the mark (though I applaud them for trying new things, especially when the \"staples\" have been so consistently good since day one.) One item that I didn't like the first time I had it but eventually grew on me was the queso: as long as you can discard your idea of what chips and queso should be, it's an incredibly tasty take on chips and cheese that bears no resemblance to \"typical\" Tex-Mex orange queso.

Any problems I've had with Smoke were solely due to their popularity; never the food or the staff. If you're planning a visit, get there early or go during off-hours, because it is a small place and has become increasingly popular with the hipster crowd (as small places cranking out awesome food tend to.) Even if you can get a seat, the amount of labor that goes into each dish means that you could be waiting quite a while for your food if there's a large party ahead of you. Also, considering how they have to smoke the meat for about a day before serving it, they do sometimes run out of some kinds of tacos.

I recently moved away from Pittsburgh, and if I could take one restaurant with me, it would be Smoke. Smoke reminds me of home, while being superior to anything I ever had there. If you are a fan of Texas-style BBQ, tacos, or just awesome food in general; I recommend Smoke without hesitation. Easily the best restaurant in Pittsburgh, and quite possibly my favorite restaurant anywhere."}
{"text":"I want so badly to be able to give this place a good review because I love their concept. Their menu is innovative and the interior of the restaurant has a very cool vibe. The first time my husband and I came here we had a great experience, but we came back a month later and it was the complete opposite. We had a reservation, but did not get seated until over an hour later. The service was slow, and by the time we finally got our food, it was dry and seemed like it had been oversmoked. The food and overall experience was not nearly as good as on our first visit, which is a shame because it is not cheap. We will give Smoke one more try, and hope that it is consistent with our first visit."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic the food was outstanding a must try! I had chicken and brisket tacos."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews unless
It is terrible. One word horrible , longest wait ever and considering how
Hungry u would
Think the food tasted better. when we received our chicken pork and brisket tacos it was sooo dry. I don't understand
How they call this place a bbq
Because it tastes nothing like it. I will never ever come
Here again."}
{"text":"Yeah I can definitely get into this joint. I loved everything about it. I like the laid back feel of it, the simplicity of the menu and of course the food. We took it easy or so we thought but the tacos turned out to be bigger than what I had thought, they were a nice size for their price but the taste was even larger. Right in line with what everyone else has been saying, great joint with great service and excellent tacos. I like the BYOB option, $2.50/person. I also tried the macaroni and cheese which was extremely flavorful as well. I'll be back sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"Excellent food, but slooowww, expensive and cash only"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh.

The food:
All the tacos are pretty good. The chicken taco with avocado cream and onions are mouth watering, the rib taco with the special BBQ sauce is great and if they ever have the pork cheek taco as a special item, do NOT think twice.
Please also consider that these guys are actually baking the tortilla for your taco AFTER you order. So complain all you want while waiting your food, you will forget it once it arrives. 
The wings are from another world (only available on Thursdays and they run out by 5 - 6PM usually). They have the perfect BBQ sauce, the blue cheese dip and the meat just doesn't want to stay on those bones, nice and juicy. 
The mac and cheese is also delicious. 

The ambience:  
I really like the staff and the owner. They are always welcoming and responsive. 

It is cash only but they have an ATM inside."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever eaten.  Service was very good also.  Tuesday is burger night only,  haven't tried the tacos,  but hear they are delicious as well.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Smoke during a weekend trip.  Cool, unique neighborhood.  The inside of the place is a simple and rustic but welcoming.  Service was friendly. It is cash only which I find to be a nuisance...  Also BYOB, at least for now.

We started with the bowl of cheese.  It was delicious but we agreed that half the portion at half the price would be more suitable for two people.  The tacos were good.  We had chicken, pork, and brisket. I enjoyed the bbq flavors but found the tacos to be each a little one-noted for 6-7 bucks a pop."}
{"text":"A couple of years ago this place would have been awarded a five star, but I'm afraid it's gone down hill.  They reduced their taco options and expanded into burgers and plated meals.  

We decided to sit at the bar and bypass a 30+ minute wait.  I ordered the brisket taco and pork taco.  The meat in the tacos was dry and overwhelming with sauce, it poured out on the tray while eating them.  The mac and cheese side was bland and lacked salt.  

Maybe we just hit this place on a bad night.  I will go back again to make sure, but this trip was disappointing."}
{"text":"Hands down the best taco I've ever had. Went for breakfast and got a breakfast taco and a pork taco. Serve great la proms coffee too. BYOB so will be back again for dinner"}
{"text":"I'm currently at Smoke, and I'll tell you- the customer service is terrible. A 3 hour wait time for mediocre tacos? Fine. But the staff pushing me away from the bar while I'm waiting for change from the bartender while it's busy? Unacceptable. The bartender was great and the margaritas on point, but the front of the house needs some serious education on service and how to manage customers in an appropriate, respectful manner."}
{"text":"This was a very interesting and unusual dining experience.  We lived in Texas for 25 years and we're on a mission to find the best smoked beef brisket in Pittsburgh.  Turns out the smoked beef here is from Australia (opposite of local!!) and is very, very lean.  The beef was sliced very thin and the portion was too small, about 1/4 the size of brisket portions at other restaurants.  The taste of the beef was above average, but not the best in Pittsburgh (try Smoq in Brookline for the best smoked brisket in Pittsburgh).  The beef slices were flanked by a few tablespoons of tiny chopped bits of more flavorful beef called \"burnt ends.\"  The BBQ sauces were very good, consistent with the restaurant's theme: unusual dishes with a lot of attention given to presenting flavorful and unique sauces.  The baked beans were outstanding.  They had robust and complex flavor, and they included beef burnt end crumbs.  If you like Austin baked beans, you will love the baked beans here; in my opinion they are the best in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I heard great things about this place so maybe we just had bad luck on this night.. it was burger night and the burgers were not cooked to temp they were missing components that were on the menu. Their juice of the day and homemade soda was horrible. I believe they got too caught up in being trendy & \"cool\" that they forgot the food has to be good. The waitress whose name I can't remember was very pleasant and did her best to accommodate date us.. I would maybe go back on a night when I can actually get bbq from a bbq joint instead we had to order disappointing burgers"}
{"text":"Finally got around to stopping by their new location for a weekday lunch, which admittedly is one of the best times to come without having to wait. I was a little confused upon arriving as they had, what seemed like, 3 hostesses around the entrance. The place was much larger than I expected but we quickly got a seat in the middle of the restaurant.

As others had suggested, we started with the queso which was delicious, as were the homemade chips. Large portion too.

I went with the Chicken and Brisket tacos for lunch which were good, although not as good as I remembered them from their Homestead days. Brisket was perfectly tender but incredibly salty during this trip - just a very overpowering taste.

I was tempted to try their mac n cheese as well, but maybe next time.

Waitstaff was pleasant but I don't understand the use of technology for technology-sake. Instead of discussing the menu and having a conversation, our waiter had his eyes fixed to his iPad for the entire ordering process. I'm sure it makes things easier for their cooks, but it added no value to the customers IMO."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS FOOD BUT I HAVE A MAJOR BEEF WITH YOU...!

Hi My Loves!

So fans know I'm having a love affair with Lawrenceville right now! I was excited to eat at Smoke again BUT I'VE GOT A BIT OF A BEEF WITH THIS PLACE!

I'm VERY disappointed in the fact that this restaurant left Homestead for Larryville. You gave hope to 8th Avenue business owners that the tide could be turned in Homestead. You had tons of business, there was consistently a 2 hour wait just for takeout! People drove to Homestead for your food! For sentimental reasons I loved your 8th Avenue place, I grew up in Homestead and had an amazing first date at your place a couple years back! That said I begrudgingly returned to your new Larryville location...

Larryville 2.0 is a bigger for sure but still a damn zoo! The wait for a table is fucking ridiculous. You guys still don't have a big enough place to accommodate the demand for your food. 

When you can get a table the food is still legit awesome. Homemade chips and queso is excellent. The mac and cheese is maybe one of the best in the burg and the brisket is to die for! I also like the pork and apricot taco and I'd love to try this place for breakfast one day.

You'd be cooler if you kept Homestead open and/or got a bigger fucking place!

In the meantime I'll still be a fan but a hard ass fan!

Love you!

{"text":"While it's been over a year since they shut their Homestead location, the owners have obviously not been idle. Their new location in Lawernceville is very cool with a wooden and rustic interior. When I visited, they were piping in some old school rap that made for a fun brunch atmosphere. We got the Mac and cheese and queso to start. The Mac and cheese was good but didn't stand out as a signature dish. The queso was very flavorful and the homemade chips added to the dish. The breakfast tacos were well flavored and had a nice punch to them. We will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Came in with a larger party on Saturday afternoon and they were very accommodating. Great service and excellent food. I recommend the queso.. its AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food but they make you wait for your full party to get there before they will seat you (even if you only have a party of two). After working many years in a restaurant as a waitress I understand this may be to help turnover time for tables, but it doesn't help customer satisfaction. Also, it is a little pricey to be cash only. Again, this may be to save money for the restaurant but it feels a little archaic. With that said, I love the food (especially the mac and cheese with chorizo) and they mix a great cocktail."}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to go Coca Cafe for Saturday brunch, but the wait was outrageous and we were starving, so we ventured down Butler Street. We came across Smoke, saw it was open and had to stop in (It's been on my to do list for ages, my friends rave about it). And it was such a good decision.

We ordered the chips and queso to start - and it's the most delicious, fluffy warm pitas that you've ever had and the queso, I don't even have words for. Maybe we were just extra hangover hungry, but I think it's really just that good. And the best part? There's an equal proportion of pitas to dip (which never happens). And you get tons of it - I probably could have just eaten that and been fine.

But, we also ordered tacos. I ordered the chicken and the special of the day, the Gringo. They were absolutely amazing. I took the chicken one home and ate it drunk at 3am; just as good then. Yum. My friend had the veggie and the brisket (she'd been before and referred to the brisket taco as \"her first real orgasm\" - so maybe you should try it). I can't describe how good the food is, I don't even like spicy, but I dealt with the (probably minimum, but i'm just a baby) spice to eat every last bite. Delicious. And so satisfying.  

My only criticisms - the water was lukewarm. Ice in the carafe would have been wonderful. it wasn't horrible, it just could have been colder. But, that could also be due to our waitress - she really could have been so much better. Not that friendly, not that helpful, didn't check on us at all and never refilled our water. Halfway through, a guy started helping us - handed us our check, got us to-go bags, etc. He was warm, friendly and hillarious - so like anywhere, it just depends. Also, cash only killllls me.

Our tab ended up being $34 for four tacos and chips/queso. I definitely loved this place and will definitely be coming back. Apparently some days, you can get Smoke to go and take it next door to see a movie at Row House. Awesome."}
{"text":"Love this place. Tuesday burger night is my crack. It's the best burger in pittsburgh. So good. The cheese queso and chips are unique and so good. Love love love this place. Food. Drinks. All of it."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday around 5:30pm with a group of 5.  Because they don't use NoWait our plan was to show up, get on the list, and then go next door to Bierport and wait 40+ minutes for a table.  That's our standard plan when trying to get a table at Smoke.  Miraculously we didn't need to this time, as they were able to seat us right away.

Smoke definitely has some of the best tacos in the city of Pittsburgh and they have vegetarian options.  The Veggie option is a solid choice for those so inclined, but a lot of my friends went for the Migas this time around.  If you go meat, you really can't go wrong.  The Chickenapple is a personal favorite, but I've also had the Brisket one and it's another great choice.

You also should not overlook the sides at this place.  We get a few to share amongst ourselves.  The Brocolini and Corn is a great option.  I have friends that swear by the Jalapeno Apple Slaw and others that go the Mac route. No matter what you chose you will not make a mistake.

The only reason this place doesn't have five stars is the lack of NoWait.  Given how crowded this place gets the wait is a killer.  Until they adopt it, do like we do.  Show up about 45 minutes before you want to eat and then kill some time over at Bierport's taproom downstairs."}
{"text":"After much deliberation I decided on rating Smoke a 3 and not a 4 for a few reasons. 
Let's start out with the not so good aspects of my experience and get it out of the way. This was my second time here, the first being a very short time after they opened. I remembered my first time as having waited almost an hour to get my food so I hadn't gone back in awhile, but decided to give it another shot. 
When I walked in they were pretty busy, and I stood at the hostess stand for about 5 minutes without anyone coming up, so being alone, decided just to sit at the bar. A hostess approached me as I was sitting down and I asked if it was fine if I sat there to which she somewhat flippantly replied \"yea, I guess so\". A bartender did approach me right away and was very friendly, immediately telling me about the special that day- a chimmi churri chicken taco. After looking at the menu for a couple minutes I decided to get that and a side of broccolini and corn. The bartender took my order and I proceeded to wait...and wait...and wait. A half an hour later I finally got my one taco and veggie side. By this time I was ravenous. A few minutes into the wait the hostess came back up and proceeded to seat another single customer at the bar. To my right were two empty bar stools. To my left were 2 bar stools, one being taken up by my bookbag, another being taken up by a different patron's coat. Instead of seating her on one of the empty stools she said \"here, you can seat at either of these stools\" without even acknowledging the coat or bag. Of course, we both removed our item so the woman could sit, but it was just odd to choose those seats when there were empty ones right beside me. Another thing that I felt was slightly ridiculous was the cocktail prices were higher than most of the food. Getting one drink would've almost doubled my bill. Even the wine was $10 a glass. Some of them sounded great, but I'm really not interested in getting a $12 dollar drink to go with my taco I'm eating off of a tin tray. 
As far as the food goes, the taco was delicious. I would hope so, since it was $7.50. (For one taco!) It was the size you would expect a taco to be, nothing out of the ordinary. The side of broccolini and corn was tasty, but very stemmy. 
The bar staff was great, checking in on me twice, making sure I had water and seeing if I needed anything. I did remember from my first visit that it used to be BYOB, and I asked if it still was. I was told you could bring your own bottle of wine (only) and there was a $15 corking fee.  $15?! That's more expensive than a lot of bottles themselves! I've never heard of a corkage fee that high and I've worked at several places that had them. 
The decor was beautiful - industrial and rustic at the same time. The women's bathroom was very clean. Maybe someday I'll go again if I decide I need a fancy taco night, there were plenty of things on the menu that sounded great. But I'll have to save my money and make sure I have nothing going on for the next hour and a half."}
{"text":"This is the letter that I wrote and mailed to the management staff at Smoke. 

August 4, 2016
 
To whom it may concern,

?I am a huge fan of Smoke, but I am writing this letter to in regards to an experience I had at Smoke last night. Three friends and myself came to Smoke for dinner last night for our friend's birthday. When we arrived at 7 p.m., we were told that the wait would be between 45 minutes- 1 hour and that we would be texted whenever our table was ready. We walked around Lawrenceville, and around 8 p.m., we decided to start walking back towards Smoke as our wait time was nearing 1 hour. (We did not receive a text yet.) When we came back in, we inquired about how much longer our wait would be. The greeter said our group was the next group of 4 to be seated, and it would be about 20 more minutes. We were a little annoyed at this point, but we decided we would wait, as this was the first time at Smoke for two of my friends. We saw a group of 4 leave, so we were thinking that we would be seated after the table was cleaned off. After about ten minutes, the table was finally cleaned off and the greeter escorted another group of 4 to the table. So, we went back up to the greeter and asked what happened since we thought we were the next group to be seated. He said he didn't know what happened and that he was very sorry, but we were the next group to be seated. He again assured us that people were getting their checks and would be leaving. Again, after about another 20 minutes or so, another group of 4 left and that table was cleaned off. And again, another group of 4 was lead back to a table. At this point, when the greeter came back, we just looked at him, confused. He started scrolling on his iPad and kept saying he was sorry and how backed up the kitchen was tonight. At this point, we were ready to go, but also wanted to stay because of how much time we had invested. (It's about 8:45 at this point). The greeter comes over and says he will talk to his manager to see what he can do because he was so sorry. He came back and said there will be an order of chips and queso delivered to our table as soon as we sit down. I'm guessing that took longer than expected because a waitress brought the chips, queso, and water out to the table we were sitting at in the waiting area. As we were eating the chips and queso, she came back around to take our orders and assured us our food would be ready right when we sat down at a table. We placed our orders and continued to wait. Finally, around 9:15 p.m., we were seated at our table and like promised, our food came right out. The taste of your food hasn't missed a beat, but the service sure has.
?I'm writing this letter because I'm been coming to Smoke since the Homestead days. Whenever I come to Smoke, I expect a wait, but ever since coming to Lawrenceville, this process has gone completely downhill.  I came here when Smoke first opened in Lawrenceville, and the service was really slow then too, but I attributed it to being newly opened and trying to work things out. When Smoke first opened in Lawrenceville, I was also told that Smoke would be on the No Wait app, but that still hasn't happened. I really do love the atmosphere and the food at Smoke, but if I ever come back again, it would just be to get takeout.  I went onto Yelp last night after I got home, and noticed many recent reviews on there have been about the same issues I addressed above.  I hope you don't take offense to this letter, but rather find the root of the problem, and work to fix it.  I wish you all the best in the future.
 
Thanks for taking the time to read this."}
{"text":"I felt compelled to write this review to clear up a few questions about this gem of a restaurant. I started coming in early June and have been a regular ever since. I have become friendly with the owners and have taken the time to find out a few things about the restaurant. 
First, they only have three tables. At this time, they are only licensed as a carry out establishment. Their carry out license included an allowance of seating for ten people to eat in. When they are able to expand and install another bathroom, they will be able to get a license to become a \"sit down\" restaurant and even apply for a liquor license. Unfortunately, these things take time and money. I know that it's in the works and continued patronage from those of us that love the place will make it happen sooner. 
Second, good food can take time. I've had my food come out in a matter of minutes and I've also had it take close to an hour. It really all depends on how busy they are. These are not \"assembly line\" tacos. When any restaurant is busy, it can take longer to get your food. I know that they do quite a bit of carry out business and sometimes they are making food for the customers that are eating in AND carry out. They take great pride in the food they serve and I hope they never sacrifice the quality of the product to make it \"faster\". I would suggest calling ahead if you are in a hurry. It's always worked for me. 
Last, for those looking for \"authentic Mexican\", you'll be disappointed. You won't get chips and salsa, rice and refried beans, or burritos. What you will get is an outstanding taco with barbecue with a Mexican street food flair. It's not fancy, it's just good. I don't need fancy plates for that. 
Like I said, the place is a gem and I encourage them to keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I cannot put into words how much my husband and I love this place!!! Everything is so fresh and the recipes they come up with blow my mind! The brisket is my favorite, I always order it without the hot peppers, I don't have a very high tolerance for hot things, however my husband loves the Brisket as is, as have a few other people I know that have ordered it. My husbands favorite is the Migas, with brisket and pinto beans.  

The staff are always great, and always seem to know exactly what they're talking about when it comes to the product. We love to go there to eat, as it is a very cool trendy place, however the pick up option for food on the go is an awesome bonus for those nights when we're looking to stay in. 

Their Queso is actually making my mouth water thinking about it, it's that good, and the \"chips\" they serve it with is the best part.  We always order more tacos than we need to because it makes awesome leftovers for the next day. Just pop them in the microwave! YUM!

If you're not sure about trying a new place and pass Smoke up, you're crazy!"}
{"text":"Smoke is always delicious! It's a trendy atmosphere in fun part of town and if you're from Pittsburgh you probably already know this. I've enjoyed Smoke for years. I still wish they had more veggie friendly options (the new mushroom options are tasty - but I dream of the day they offer smoked pulled jackfruit) - but it's hard to complain when the food's this good. And I have to say even though I miss their old BYOB method, they do nice drinks in house!"}
{"text":"Taste wise, this is easily one of the best new places I've eaten at in quite some time.  Smoke is very easy to miss / hard to find, as it's on East 8th Avenue, which is the main road that runs through Homestead.  It's not located in the Waterfront area.

I absolutely love this place.  It's very informal inside, as there are only 4 tables and a few seats at the bar, and you pay your bill at a register.   This place definitely needs to expand, which I think it will.  The demand for the food is way too high for a restaurant this size, and every time I've been here there were double the number of people waiting than there were eating.

Anyways, to the food.  The menu is simple, with 8 or so different tacos (all soft tortillas) on the menu.  There are a few sides and a few specialty drinks.  I've tried just about everything on the menu and everything was amazing.  I really don't know what else to say.   Everything tastes fresh, and is not overly seasoned or salty. 

REMINDER:  IF YOU EAT HERE, YOU MUST TRY THE MAC AND CHEESE."}
{"text":"Incredible food, horrendous customer service. Smoke has the best BBQ and Mac and cheese in Pittsburgh, unfortunately it's impossible to enjoy their food because you will easily wait 2-3 hours for service. It's unfathomable to me that a restaurant that serves a majority of food that requires no \"cooking to order\" can't put food on a table in a timely manner."}
{"text":"If you ate a smoke a year ago and enjoyed it, beware. Something in their kitchen changed and their food is no longer what it used to be. Not terrible, but not great. Then you add on ridiculously long wait times and you have a recipe for a very disappointing dining experience."}
{"text":"I can't put into words how amazing this place is.  Everything I have ever ordered from here has been simply spectacular.  The food is just amazing.  Favorites include the mac & cheese, rib taco and the Brisket taco is pretty much my favorite dish in all of Pittsburgh right now.

2 things you should know about Smoke: 

They take a long time to get you your food.  Not sure why this is, but at least it is well, well worth it in the end.  Be prepared to wait.  I usually get take out to help alleviate the wait - call it in and go pick it up.

There are hardly any seats in here.  Maybe 3 tables, and a bar that will seat about 4 or 5 folks."}
{"text":"it was my first trip to Smoke and had a great time.  The food was great with a diverse selection of tacos.  i got the chirizo taco with brisket mac and cheese.  both were outstanding with a rich BBQ taste.  the slaw was OK.  place is small, cash only, and BYOB.  service is friendly and accomodating.  i reccomend it."}
{"text":"The tacos are pretty meh. Definitely worth passing up if you've been to a real taco and/or BBQ town. Also, they need to really figure out their table management system. We were told that we would have to wait another hour after we were initially told there would be a one hour wait.  Definitely don't visit during a peak time like Friday or Saturday night. You can certainly find better tacos in places like Las Palmas, Tako, and Doce Tacqueria. The staff is also somewhat stuck up at times, refusing to remove an ingredient in a taco because that's how the \"chef created it\" even when it's for allergy reasons."}
{"text":"By far the best BBQ in the entire area. Please stop bitching about the wait time. Sure you'll wait a long time because assholes like me are coming here from cleveland. The food is amazing. Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place to try in Lawrenceville last Saturday night and thanks to Yelp we found this place.  It is very small inside with not a ton of seating and luckily they do call ahead seating. I called about 40 minutes before we arrived and it was an hour and half wait.  We were lucky enough to get a seat at the bar 20 minutes after we arrived.  My only complaint of the night was the service at the bar was very very slow. I waited over 25 minutes to put in a drink order-we only got 2 cans of beer (Victory Summer Love) which took another 10 or so minutes. They have a pretty extensive drink list but I was not that impressed with the draft and bottle beer list.  We put in an appetizer for the queso and chips which was very tasty.  White cheese with the perfect amount of spice and homemade chips. By the time we started our app our table was ready.  Our server was great and the order came out quickly.  I got the pork taco with the coffee sauce which is supposedly the least spicy of their sauces (wow it still had a smoky kick to it). For my side I went with the grilled corn bread which was just ok-tasted more like a corn bread French toast.  My fiancé ordered a bbq sandwich and the mac and cheese. I highly recommend the mac and cheese (all of their sandwiches come with a side)-again that white cheddar goodness.  The portions are pretty hefty so we had enough for leftovers the next day.  It is a bit pricey ( 6-7$ for 1 taco) but worth the price."}
{"text":"New, trendy kinda place. We ate at the bar which was great. I had the veggie taco, pork taco and tried some of the mac and cheese. Tacos were yummy. The pork one had a lot of pork, worth the price for one taco. The veggie one was full of black beans and corn. Great flavor. Loved the potato fritters on top. The mac and cheese was soooo rich. Definitely a sharing dish. No drinks other than strange juices on the menu. We stuck with good ole' H20. Would definitely go back. Yum."}
{"text":"Our first experience with smoke was a 3/5. My boyfriend and I ordered the coleslaw, which was average, the pork and ribs tacos, which were just far too dry to enjoy, and the queso, which is amazing. 

The only reason we decided to go back a second time was for the delicious queso. We called in to get our name put on the list and they told us our table would we ready in a 75 minutes. We then downloaded the NoWait app which they suggested downloading after making our reservation, which told us how many parties were ahead of us. After about 45 minutes we received the text that our table was ready and if we did not arrive in 10 minutes our table would be given away, even though the app told us there were 7 parties still ahead of us! I promptly called the restaurant again to tell them there is no way we would get there in time as we live 15 minutes away. The person who answered the phone was quite rude and explained how they don't even use the app. I also told her that according to her time when we originally called in, we still had 30 more minutes to arrive. 

Needless to say when we finally got there, which was well before her original 75 minute estimate, our table had been given away. Essentially, the only way to secure your table is to wait there the entire time because they have no way of estimating how long it will take. So if you want to waste and entire night waiting for your table, unable to wait at home, smoke is for you.

We had already driven all the way to the restaurant so we just put our name back on the list. We waited for another 35 minutes and finally got seated. We ordered the chicken and brisket tacos, broccolini and corn, and queso. The chicken taco was by far the worst taco I have ever had. After one bite my stomach was hurting from how spicy it was (so if you like really spicy maybe you will like this taco). I unfolded the taco and contents were some bland chicken in a bland avocado sauce, and a huge amount of hot sauce covering the entire thing. I tried to eat some of the chicken not covered by the sauce, but the chicken alone wasn't very appetizing. My boyfriend had a similar experience with the brisket taco. Although the brisket meat was good, the taco was difficult to enjoy because the only flavor that it contained was extreme spiciness. It seems that because the tacos don't really have any flavor, they try to add flavor by just putting on more hot sauce. If you like hot sauce, then I'm sure you would like their tacos. The broccolini and corn was good, and the queso was very yummy again.

Overall we will not return to Smoke because we do not wish to waste our whole night waiting in the restaurant to secure a table, the front desk staff was rude in dealing with the whole wait list system, and the taco are just really not good at all and leave your stomach hurting from how spicy it is."}
{"text":"Tuesday are now burgers only. Seriously, all you can get is your choice between 4 or 5 burgers and French fries. The potatoes are soaked in vinegar and then fried and their awesome. The burgers are the best I have ever eaten! The meat melts in your mouth like butter. Spectacular!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow.

The reviews were rave...and this place had been on my list for awhile, and the wait was beyond worth it.

A friend and I headed there before a movie at the waterfront.  We immediately wanted to try everything.

The staff was soooo nice, welcoming and helpful.

We had the Fritopie.  Amazingness.  Piles of fritos with heaven on top. 

Between the two of us we had the pork taco, the breakfast taco, and the short rib tacos.  Wow.  Each one better than the one before it.  BUT - I am dreaming of the pork taco, it haunts me at night - beckoning me to return.
They were out of the chorizo and the brisket.  The potential of those alone - is enough reason to head back.

The sides were also great - Mac and Cheese. Amazing. Next time want to try it with the chili added. 

The jalapeno apple slaw had a nice bite, but was fresh compliment to the tacos.

The beans were also great (but hey - they're beans...to even mention them means they were great).

It's byob, very casual, only a few seats.  

As this place grows - I would assume it will be harder to get a seat.  Next time I'm planning on a take-out feast.

Hopefully tonight."}
{"text":"I have experienced a healthy majority of East End dining options, both high end and not.  However, my favorite dish in the city if the rib taco from Smoke.  The perfect mustard based sauce blends so well with the rib rub.  The pickles on it are also a great accompaniment.   I love Cure/Morcilla, Vandal, Smallman Galley etc, but in a vacuum, the Smoke Rib Taco is my choice (I always get 3, and then eat salad the next day).  There's usually a wait, but you can always do takeout.  Or you can do your best senior citizen impression and go early and secure a seat (the bar is fine too).  Difficult to accompany large parties, go with a loved one or random stranger you met on Tinder.

IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND:  Procol Harum.  I don't know a ton of their work, but \"Whiter Shade of Pale\" is still one of my favorite songs worthy of lofty status."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since they were located in Homestead.  I have never been disappointed with anything that I have ordered here, but I would say anything with the brisket is my personal fav.  Such good smoky flavor. My hubby's go to is the chicken apple taco.  The mac and cheese and all of the is also top notch.  The place is fairly small, so there is usually a wait.  I would say it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Garbage...absolute garbage. I never had such bland overpriced food. Where to begin... Chicken and brisket need to be marinated or marinated longer. Soo tasteless. They try to cover this up by throwing what I'm sure they think are exotic sauces on them, which are also terrible. Don't bother with the way over priced sides as they are equally tasteless. This place is perfect for Lawrenceville as they prey on ignorant Pittsburgh hipsters that don't know what good food is and are unwilling to travel. Shame on you Smoke, you should have been left to die in Homestead. But instead you are taking advantage of less educated people."}
{"text":"some of the best BBQ I've had in Pittsburgh so far! Fun mixture of Mexican and BBQ. Has some of the best tacos I've ever had!! I would definitely recommend going here on a complete empty stomach! It's your classic southern comfort food and the portions are huge!!! could be a good or bad thing, you can go on an empty stomach and eat it all or take some home for left overs. They don't take reservations or credit cards so don't forget that!"}
{"text":"I've been a consistent patron of Smoke since they were located in Homestead.  I've never had a negative experience. 

Atmosphere: Urban rustic! Casual vibe - no need to wear your Sunday best.

Service: Attentive and typically seated within 15-20 minutes during busy times.

Food: Great!  We do typically order the same items: Chicken Apple Tacos, Burnt Ends appetizer,  Macaroni and Cheese, Salad with those delicious fried nuggets, Broccollini and Corn. The quality of the food is fresh and well prepared. 

Cocktails: Recently I had a mango margherita and delicious!"}
{"text":"The chips and queso are good. The brisket taco is great, chicken taco was so so. Friendly service but the kitchen is incredibly slow. I didn't time it but we had to wait a long time for our food. Worth the wait? Maybe but I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed the food and vibe at this taco spot. We used to go to their location in Homestead often but are happy they are now located in Lawrenceville. BYOB is a plus, but don't forget it's cash only. I would recommend any of the tacos, they are all great.
Also, we ordered the queso and chips. Absolutely amazing. Soft fried pita chips are so good. Eat it!"}
{"text":"This is for Burger Tuesday only!

Two of us walked in around 8:30, greeted by a friendly host. He seated us right away. I swear the decor keeps getting better in there. The noise level though with all the people and music, was a bit challenging to have a conversation. 

The service continued to be stellar after the host seated us. Our waitress couldn't get to us right away but let us know she knew we were there. I always appreciate that. Throughout the meal she was personable and accommodating.

The burgers: we both got the More Deluxer done medium well. I wanted to swim in the bacon jam. My friend took a bite of my burger after he was done with his and mentioned that he thought it tasted completely different than the meat on his burger - he actually said his tasted more like brisket than a burger (he wasn't upset!). The fries aren't my favorite, and were fairly cold when they arrived at our table. And while I applaud the homemade ketchup, it tasted like I was dipping my fries in spaghetti-os sauce. 

Overall, I'd go back for the the burger but get a different side (if possible)."}
{"text":"Best taco I've ever had. This is a worthy destination for food or drink. Try the aqua fresca, fresh squeezed orange juice, or a well above par cup of coffee. If you find yourself at the waterfront, wonder on over to 8th Avenue, this food is eons better than Panera, Bar Louis, or any of the like."}
{"text":"I miss this being BYOB. 
That being said...
Try their entire menu. THEIR ENTIRE MENU. 
The special taco you're not sure about? ORDER IT. 
The rib taco, GET IT.
The brisket? Eat it up!
The mac and cheese, the beans, the jalapeno slaw, the queso... ORDER IT UP!

You want to stuff yourself full of this food. You want to bask in the warmth that is their decor.
You need to. 

That aqua fresca? Nothing is better on a summer day.
Fresh squeezed lemonade? You'll never have something more thirst quenching, it's like drinking a cool river of love while standing on the sun. You feel me? 

The wait staff is kind and attentive. 
Be like me, make friends with your neighbor and they may offer you some of their beans that you didn't order and now regret that decision.

I have been here 3 times so far, each time is even better than the last. 
THEY ARE CASH ONLY, BE PREPARED, BRING ENOUGH FOR A TIP, TAKE OUT THE EXTRA 20, YOU'LL THANK ME YOU DID."}
{"text":"The food is good but the wait is unreal. The chips are overly salty other wise they have some great tacos and sides. I love the chips and queso even if it's salty. It's in a great location and they have some good drinks."}
{"text":"The food is average.  The Mac and cheese had good consistency but no flavor. Utter lack of salt and pepper. We got it with pork and that was flavorful but the portion was small.  We tried to spice it up with a sauce but that was a $1 extra. 

My recommendation is this place is ok if you want to spend $7 on a decent taco. Just bring your own salt and pepper shakers and a bottle of cholula."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love bbq and who doesn't love tacos? No one. Combine the two and you have Smoke! Brilliant, I tell you. 

As soon as you open the door, the smell of smoke hits you right away. Smelled delicious. The hubby and I came here late on a Friday night and the wait for a table was 30 minutes. Luckily, the bar was empty so that's where we sat. The bartender was super helpful, friendly, and attentive.

The bartender told us that most people get two tacos or one taco and a side and that's enough to fill you. We were skeptical of that but we took his advice anyway. Hubby got the ribs taco and the burnt ends taco. I got the chicken apple taco along with a side of their special side that day: macaroni salad. I would say that the amount of food suggested by the bartender was accurate for me, but not so much for the hubby. He probably could have gotten two or three more to be satisfied. Anyway, of the three tacos, my favorite was the ribs; it was so moist and flavorful. I absolutely loved the bbq flavor. The chicken apple had a nice contrast of flavors and textures and was surprisingly spicy, which I enjoyed. Burnt ends was my least favorite as there was little depth of flavor; all you could taste was smoke. Although it was delicious for a few bites, it seemed like a flavor that I would get sick of after a while. 

I found the tacos to be a bit pricey and the fact that they only take cash makes it a little less convenient. However, I would definitely come back. The service was great and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Had the Gringo and the Rib tacos, which were bigger than I expected, along with the original chips and queso. Don't be fooled by the word chips, however. They are the perfect combination of chewy and crispy. Trust me, you need to order these. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Visited this place a few times. Interesting food combinations in the tacos. Sometimes, it's a hit, sometimes, it's a miss. If you're a spice-a-phobe like me, ask for your sauces on the side, because some of the tacos are quite spicy by default. Every side I have had is tasty (mac and cheese, chips and queso, potato salad) but so rich that it kinda makes you feel ill if you eat too much of it. 
Food seems to take a while, even on weekdays. One time, we were even given a free cookie because the wait was so long, which was nice of them to offer, but we wish the service was a bit quicker.
Cash only. BYOB."}
{"text":"Utterly amazing tacos.  They had a smoked ribeye + eggs special going which was probably the best ribeye I've ever had.  The fresno hot sauce was a little on the bland side from my perspective, but I ordered a side of sauteed hot peppers which totally made up for it.  And even though it's not on the menu, they have gluten free tortillas and the staff know what menu items are gluten free, which is really great if you need it."}
{"text":"I'd be lying if I didn't say Smoke used to be my favorite restaurant. Unfortunately, they have fallen down a slippery slope. After the blasphemous act of removing their BBQ plates from their menu; which was a divine meal if I have ever had one, I decided to return and try their tacos. It's noon on a Monday, and they are out of two signature items-their shrooms and their burnt ends. It is clear that they manipulate you into ordering their high margin items, which is unfortunate given the fact that their quality meals once brought me joy. I look forward to a competing BBQ eatery opening down the block in a matter of time, as they will certainly receive my visits at least thrice a week, as Smoke once did. These continuous acts of betrayal are nothing short of a travesty, and if not for the fact that I don't want the landlord to suffer from the loss of what is sure to be a high value lease, I look forward to their imminent demise."}
{"text":"We went in for lunch saturday at 3pm, it was empty but they sat us and after waiting for 20min for our server to at least say hello or offer drinks we gave up and left. We asked what happened and they said she would be with us \"soon\". Not acceptable, just go to Tako for a better experience and amazing tacos."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD!!! TO DIE FOR!!!  I am IN LOVE with SMOKE,,everything is just soooo good,,just sad they moved away from homestead"}
{"text":"I am a frequent diner at smoke. The food is very savory and leans on the spicy side. Two notable dishes: the chicken taco (not spicy) and the burnt ends (moderately hot). The sides are always flavorful and filling. I like to share my food with others, since I can never choose what to get. The serving sizes aren't huge though. Staff are friendly and always willing to explain the menu and tell what is gluten free and not. Only complaint is that you have to pay with cash (which we always forget). If you go with a giftcard, you still have to tip with cash. 


Expect to wait if you're in a group!"}
{"text":"I have heard awesome things about Smoke, so I was excited to try. The atmosphere was hipster/trendy, but very small. They accept reservations for groups, but the location honestly isn't ideal for them. Our wait was said to be 1.5 -2 hours, which we expected at 5:30 on a Saturday night with 7 people. Sadly, our 2 hour wait turned into almost 3 hours, and we had already invested so much time we stayed. Some of us had seats at the bar, so we at least got an appetizer and some drinks while we waited. Once we were sat, we ordered pretty quickly (we had already looked at the menu like 10 times while we waited), but the food took about 45 minutes to come out. 

The food was good, but it wasn't good enough for me to risk this wait time very often. I had the bbq plate with brisket and chicken. It was a VERY large portion which was great, because I wanted two sides and wanted to share. Everyone else got tacos, and for the most part they were pleased. The chips we got with the queso were awesome, a combination of a pita and a chip, so I would definitely recommend those. I also loved that they have $4 cans of beer in addition to a decent draft list, wine, and mixed drinks. 

Bottom line - Smoke is definitely a cool place to check out, but you will for sure be waiting a while if you have a group, and there will realistically be a wait for 2-3 people too. You can put your name on the list, so do yourself a favor...and do it. Also, this is a cash only place. You can never say you don't know though, because it is literally plastered everywhere."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! The macaroni & cheese is the best I ever had. The tacos are huge and full of flavor. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very intimate - I love that it's BYOB. I'm very sad that they'll be moving to Lawrenceville this spring because they're currently only about 5 minutes from where I live, but I'm sure they'll get even more customers. And of course I'll still continue to go!"}
{"text":"Smoke is the go-to date night for my wife and me - if your're trying to get a feel for Lawrenceville and the Pittsburgh food scene, this is the place.  Hipster restaurant in every way at its finest; we're talking exposed brick, hole-in-the-wall type exposed lighting, unique mixed drinks, interesting/exotic additions to each dish, and of course tattooed servers.  

Speaking of the drinks, the agua fresca drinks are a great way to start.  Each day they rotate the fresh fruit juice base and mix it with your choice of gin or vodka to spice it up..  Whenever the mango is an option, I will bypass ordering a beer and go for one of these every time. 

Appetizers are great here too. When I'm with friends, they insist on the queso which is top-notch nachos (leave it to the hipsters to make simple nachos amazing). Just a thick floury cheese with a bit of a kick and some quality pitas.  This isn't your classic plate of store-bought chips drizzled with cheese and jalapenos on a checkered paper in a basket, this is art.
When it is just my wife and me however, we go for the burnt ends which may be my favorite dish here.  Somehow they manage to get the juiciest pulled pork but perfectly crisp each strand's end so that its as soft as butter but as crispy as potato chips simultaneously.  If I had to recommend one dish - this is the one.

For the main course I have tried all the tacos and keep coming back to the pork as the taco of choice.  The chicken apple bacon is a crowd please but is a little less exciting than the pork, gringo or brisket.  So if you are feeling safe and want a delicious taco, go for the CAB, but if you want something with a kick and chock-full of flavor, try these other ones.  Amazing sauces in each one and honestly not a taco you'll find anywhere else.

Wish the place wasn't cash only, and as others have mentioned, there are no reservations so the line/wait can take some time if you don't get it right.  But hey, they're hipsters, what else would you expect?"}
{"text":"I've had the tacos, and they are good...top three in Pittsburgh. 

But the burger...yes I said burger...I mean, I typed 'burger' and now I've added '' so you know I'm serious...'how serious?' You ask... serious enough to write a review and post a picture give these hipsters 4 stars. 

Check yo taco at the door brah"}
{"text":"Amazing Tacos - highly recommend the pork and chicken/apple. House made chips are some of the best I've had. Burnt Ends are a highlight, Mac & Cheese is decadent in all the right ways. Can't miss."}
{"text":"Yummy, but pretentious.  I've only been on weekends, but the wait is always super long.  We waited over 3 hours (on a Saturday night, to their credit) for 3 people, and then were seated at the bar..

Just discovered that Atlas (downstairs part of the Row house) is BYOF (what?!), and the awesome bartender there gave us the grand idea of ordering takeout and eating there..definitely the better experience!

Queso is my favorite from anywhere, but I like Doce Taquerita's tacos way better (and they're half the price, with like a 5 minute wait time)."}
{"text":"Food is decent but over-rated. The place is definitely VERY hipster....I'm not sure if my expectations were to high or what but the taco stand over in Brookline has much better tacos for a fraction of the price. 

I won't be rushing back but may decide to get it another chance in the future."}
{"text":"SMOKE was awesome.  This is exactly what Pittsburgh needs. Great food that is reasonably priced. The owners are cool and the place is simple and very chill.  Not tacky!  We got pork, chicken, brisket and veggie tacos.  The sauces are perfect.  We even made some new friends sharing a table.  Be back real soon!"}
{"text":"Any place in Pittsburgh that serves Horchata automatically gets four stars. If you've never had it, you have to try it.

Really good tacos. They are more gourmet than traditional, with interesting BBQ pairings. The chicken apple sausage is pretty good, and sometimes they have a sirloin steak special that is out of this world. I personally often just get the mac n cheese (not quite as good as Pig and Chicken, but lord knows I can't eat there everyday) and black beans and call it a day. Between the two of us, we've probably tried most of the tacos here and haven't found one we don't like yet.

Our only complaint is sometimes they can be really really slow. I think they need more staff in the back."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was delicious - bloody maries alongside egg taco w/smoked pork, and BBQ chicken taco.  Lovely environment, interesting and flavorful food, and a great staff.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Slow service, extremely over-priced, and CASH only!

$8 for a taco?  In what universe?  \"Out of smoked meat?\"  Uh, smoked meat is your supposed specialty.  

I could go on but I'll stop here.  I've been four times and won't be going back.  Two hours after calling in an order and arrived to find it not ready and had to wait another 30 minutes."}
{"text":"I use Yelp to find restaurants that are good and that I would normally not stumble upon. To pay it forward, I'm compelled to let everyone know about Smoke in Homestead. It's a cool little place tucked away behind the monster of the Waterfront. 

We had  chicken, brisket, pork, and chorizo tacos, all were very good with distict flavors and combinations. A little on the small side though, I would need at least two to feel satisfied. 

The mac and cheese side is outrageous! Seriously, just get it, that's all I'm saying. The apple jalapeno slaw is also fresh and tasty. 

The horchata and aqua fresca are made fresh and are a nice departure from \"mexican Coke\", which is so played out anyway.

It's worth the trip, the staff is cool and the food is perfect. Look at 4-6 for each taco, and try some drinks."}
{"text":"I have been waiting to go here for months. The first time i tried to eat at Smoke, the wait was two hours so today was finally the day! Overall the food was good. The service was good. But for the food, this place is extremely overpriced."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Good variety of tacos to choose from plus some delicious sides and appetizers. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Smoke BBQ Taqueria offers a unique dining atmosphere. Very modern and appealing decor and a wonderful color scheme make you really feel comfortable. Despite this the
music playing was slightly louder than we would have liked and talking across the table was a bit of a task, not unbearable but voice had to be raised. The water is served without ice which we actually agreed was a huge plus! Who would've thought!? As far as the meals are concerned I was extremely pleased with the chicken and burnt ends brisket meal. The meats were cooked perfectly and very flavorful. There are a number of side options that are unique and all appetizing. Our only gripe was the taco order only comes with one taco and the price is a bit steep for such a small servicing without being accompanied by a side. Luckily my entree came with two sides  and I am always happy to share with my lovely girl! 4/5 Definitely recommend if you are in Lawrenceville in Spring/Summer and are craving Mexican style BBQ! Will be trying the ribs next!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Their food is affordable and delicious ! But I hate that it's a cash only I wanted to buy two chicken apples but only had a $10."}
{"text":"My second time here, first in July and it was even better than I remembered. Quite possibly my favorite restaurant and I have access to numerous BBQ and taco options being from Texas. It's definitely my #1 recommendation for anyone asking and I won't miss it the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"They only have burgers in Tuesdays, which, is disappointing.  I've eaten many $14 burgers, and today's burger was not at all worth that. 

The menu of four burgers is small, and lackluster, and the fries could have been better. I would go back another day, but after today, I think I am just reaffirmed in thinking this place is just okay, and very expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Saw this place a few weeks ago and heard from a friend it was really good but they have long waits and run out of food. So taking that as a factor I went early Saturday. 

I will start with the bad and with only one bad thing I will keep it short. It took a little time to get someone to greet me and put my small group in the system for seating. That was about it. After that we were seated fast and orders taken. Also I feel since it's a new place everyone is still trying to find the flow of it and they are all doing a great job but just need to get the rhythm down.

They don't serve alcohol but the beer store is right next to it and for a small fee of $1.75 a person you can do BYOB.

They have a small menu but everything has big flavor. I mean the brisket Mac n cheese was awesome! Every taco we got was amazing. The tacos are personal size but the sides easily feed 2 to 3 people with extra. We all just got the tacos we wanted and split the sides. The bill was not bad at all and everything was very good. I would go back and you should try it."}
{"text":"My new favorite place in Pittsburgh. Most amazing combination of flavors I have ever experienced- so well executed- amazing- can't say it enough. My Favorite- The side order of cowboy beans gave me such internal warmth I almost teared up. Great drink of the day- fresca something- DO IT. Chicken taco isy current favorite.  I order two tacos, mac and cheese and beans to share with my husband, he gets two tacos, and we get out of there for under 20. Amazing. Mac and cheese is so creAmy (AND MY SON LOVES IT) it fills you up after two tacos- so stop complaining about the size- if you want big without flavor- go to a fast food place.  this is quality and that is the size it comes in- love it or leave it. They say the tacos are small, but they are BUSTING with flavor.   BEST FOOD YET here in pittsburgh. YUMMM."}
{"text":"This place had a very nice atmosphere and a nice Smokey smell when you walk in. The house queso was awesome along with the pita bread that came with it. The tacos were not as flavorful as I had expected for the price. I got the chicken apple and the rib taco. The rib taco was pretty good in terms of flavor but the chicken apple was very bland. I got a horchata as well which was pretty good but not as milky as the typical horchata. Overall, it was alright but I probably wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"I have loved this place since it was in Homestead.  You can't go wrong with a brisket taco and some queso and homemade chips.  It is literally the best you will ever eat.  I dream of those flavors at night sometimes. They have NoWait but you can't get in line unless you go there first and check in with the hostess. Not sure what the point of that is other than to tell you approx how long you'll have to wait before leave the house.  Which makes you not even want to go sometimes."}
{"text":"Smoke is so so delicious! 

I love the Egg Taco and can't seem to order anything else. The Mac and cheese is to die for! 

TIPS: The smoked meats are great, but some of the tacos pack some heat!. Ask your server about this if you are at all sensitive to spice. Get there early to save a table on the NoWait app and stroll around Lawrenceville while you wait. It's not always busy, but we have waited 2 hours for a table on a busy night - well worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm publishing this because I saw a lot of holes in the concept. I loved the food and hope they get the rest right. 

There's nothing better on a hot day than lukewarm water. I'm saying that as a joke because it actually happened at smoke.  Plus on a hot day I'm not sure if there that cheap to cool the place or not but still I understand that the smoker takes up most of the area of the place but work with me on those dog days of summer. 

The food. 

The only saving grace is the food. 

The breakfast taco was phenomenal and the chorizo was out of this world. 

No doubt about it. 

You'll not go wrong if you get those two accompanying that with the queso is well worth the wait. 

I'm publishing this because you have to get the little things right along with the bread and the butter. 

Smoke is better then good. 

I want it to be great."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening and asked for a table for 6.  Was told to wait for 1.5 hours, even though it seemed like they were not completely full.  When I came back 10 minutes later to check, another employee tells me they will actually have a table ready in half an hour.  Hmm.. so we decided to wait.  And after another 15 minutes, I get a call on my phone saying \"the owner's family\" is coming in and now they no longer have a table for us until 2 hours later.  I complained saying that I was counting upon them.  The answer I get back is that they don't take large groups until after 9 PM.  So, why are you telling us this now?  We gave up and asked them whether we could do a take out instead.  And they tell us it takes more than 1 hour to do the take out.  1 hour for a take out??  They rationalized it by saying that it takes longer to prepare a take out for a larger group.  Hmm.. really.

Moral: if you have a group larger than 4, best avoid this place.  Sure, they have decent food.  But there are plenty other places on butler street with good food AND service."}
{"text":"I love all their tacos, I love their mac, and I love their margarita mix. Pretty much everything on the menu is fantastic. And the prices are very low for the quality.

The only problem is the wait: on a Saturday night, it can go up to 2 hours! And, even when you do get seated, food takes forever to come out. 

However, I still go once a week, it's that good :-)"}
{"text":"First: definitely not a barbecue restaurant.  Some of the meats in some of their tacos are roasted, but you can't buy a plate of brisket or a pulled pork sandwich here.  (I'm Southern.  I have very strong feelings about barbecue.)

I had a pork and a brisket taco with a side of potato salad, and my partner had chicken with a side of black beans.  The barbecue (all 3 meats) were dry and pretty tough.  Actually, the pork was some of the least tender \"barbecued\" pork I've ever had - not the product of at least 12 hours on low heat.  Everything tasted great, but go elsewhere if you're looking for barbecue.  The black beans were excellent.  Given that it's in grungy Homestead, $15 for two tacos, a side, and a drink is a little steep.

Service was excellent - very friendly, very helpful, very attentive without being smothering.

Pretty nice digs inside.  Looks like they're still getting used to the space: they had a bunch of boxes stored behind the bar that looked a little junky, but the rest is good inside.  I'm not 100% certain, but I think they're still flying the cloth banner out front instead of a real sign.  That's cute when you've been open for a few weeks, but it's pretty trashy when you've been open almost a year, especially when you're charging more than $2 for a taco.

I'd have gone 3.5, except that this is yet another Pittsburgh business that doesn't take credit cards.  It's 2012, for chrissakes, and you're not a street corner taco stand.  Stop making me carry cash just so that you can hide revenue.  Minus one star.  Minus another half star for claiming to be a barbecue restaurant when you're really just a taquería."}
{"text":"I think this is one of the best places to get tacos in the city. They are very rich and tasty. I love the food here! Nice atmosphere/decor and friendly staff. Be warned this is a cash only place. Service can be on the slows side- I wouldn't come here if I was in a hurry. They recycle which is a plus."}
{"text":"Just to let you know always call ahead for a table and expect to wait about 20-30 minutes for your meal after you order. It's so worth the wait, you'll understand once you dig into these magical tacos. If you're really hungry you can't go wrong with queso and lightly fried pita chips.. They're a home run. For tacos my hands down favorite is the rib and close second is the chicken apple. If it's your first time I recommend trying both I just mentioned, the jalapeño mayo is amazing! Honestly be patient and you will be rewarded with amazing food, and yes the place is very 'hipster' but it's Lawrenceville, it's expected.

My rank of tacos:
1.Ribs
2.Chicken/Apple
3.Brisket
4.chorizo

Pros- 
*The signature 'smoke' smell
*Laid back environment
* reclaimed/industrial theme
*Mac&Cheese 
*Rib taco 

Cons
-wish they had more seating
-wish they delivered"}
{"text":"Outstanding service folk. Best tunes playing. Creative and unique cocktails. Flavor-bursting tacos. Great decor. Warming queso dip. And the donut was deadly good. Will undoubtedly be back."}
{"text":"After spending three hours in Frick Park on a Sunday, my hiking buddy suggested that we head over to Smoke.  My buddy had been to Smoke about about a dozen times and was shocked that I'd never been considering my love of tacos.

We ate at the \"bar\" (quotations because there was no alcohol service) since there were a couple families taking up the tables.  I tried both of the chicken tacos and I was warned they would be spicy--they weren't, unless you count about 4 cilantro leaves as spicy.  Meh.  The chicken was pretty underwhelming in flavor and the lack of kick to the taco was a disappointment.  The mac & cheese, however, was quite tasty.

While the price of $4-5 a taco seems like a deal, the tacos are pretty small.  Most people would need two tacos and a side.  Combined with the unimaginative chicken, I felt like I overpaid for what I could have just whipped up in 20 minutes or less for a fraction of the cost in my own kitchen...and actually have used some spices.

The pluses were the service--very attentive and friendly--and the industrial chic decor.  I'd try it again since I've heard good things about the other tacos, but the chicken just didn't do it for me. 

FYI, CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"You like smoked meats? Look no further. Do yourself a favor and get the black bean dip, it's super tasty and probably the best I've ever had(be careful not to fill up on it). We also started with burnt ends, delicious. For mains we split ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. The ribs were nice, fall off the bone. Brisket was good, a little dry, and the pork was good but I've had better. One of our friends had brisket and chicken tacos, they must have been great cause he devoured them before I could steal any! It was a Friday night, we sat as soon as we entered without a res. They were out of a few items, which was a bummer but a good sign that they're doing something right. 
Overall it's good slow n low eats in a pretty hip setting. Get and get some."}
{"text":"We had a party of 7. I called an hour before and they had our table ready when everyone arrived. The waiter was great and very patient. Food was super, as always. The only 2 negatives: it was a very warm evening and the air conditioning was either Off or on very low. We were all uncomfortable. When water is served, it is served without Ice!!! It was already hot and now we were to drink uncooled water. I think not!
I hate to post anything negative. While these items are relatively small, they were annoying.
Overall, we had a great time!!!!! 
Thanks Smoke"}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night around 7 and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. Our waitress was nice but the service wasn't memorable. She kept saying she would \"give us another minute\" when we didn't need one. I get it though, she seemed busy. One thing is they seem to take your order on a cell phone....fine but doesn't seem necessary to me. At first I was annoyed because I thought she was texting while taking our order. 

The chips and queso were amazing and reasonably priced for the HUGE portion. We took about half home and it was still tasty the next day. I had the burnt ends taco at our waitress's recommendation and it was delicious and a good size. I also had the mac and cheese which was very tasty but did not blow my mind like I thought it might from some of these reviews. 

BF had the special of the day which was a chili with the burnt ends. Tasty but VERY spicy.....he's a wimp though when it comes to heat. 

Cash only poilcy is midly annoying and the vibe is a little too hipster for my taste but overall a good meal. 2 beers, an appetizer and two meals with plenty of food came to $45 before tip."}
{"text":"I stopped in after work on a Wednesday night with my husband. It wasn't very crowded to our surprise and got a seat right away. Our waitress was very helpful and friendly. Everything was delicious. My husband ordered Gringo and Chorizo tacos and   I had the special which was a chicken cordon bleu sandwich with fries. I loved the decor. It was fun and interesting. We will be back and next time with some friends!"}
{"text":"I got one rib taco and two brisket tacos.  The brisket tacos were amazing and the mustard used was a perfect complement to the tender meat.  The rib taco was solid, but the brisket taco is in a class by itself.  Make sure you get the jalapeño lemonade."}
{"text":"I have been irritated about my experience for 24 hours now so I want to review this place as soon as possible so I can just forget about.

I cannot get over how unnecessarily expensive this place is. ~$7 for a dinky taco. I only ordered one taco when I saw that price because I assumed they would be larger. It came rolled up in foil and the taste and quantity of onions was overwhelming, I couldn't taste anything else.  $14 for queso and chips? Granted the chips were delicious, the bowl of queso was pretty small for the amount charged. 


Not to mention this place is cash only--with a bill of $70 for TWO people (before tip)--luckily my friend had enough cash and I was able to pay him back. 

Our waitress was kind and attentive, however. 

Not worth it to come for mediocre food and high price tag."}
{"text":"The customer service was awful. The hostess was probably one of the rudest people I've ever met. Her attitude straight up sucked booty"}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever had in my life. Tried the chicken apple and pork. Delicious. I will be coming back many times."}
{"text":"I was super excited to hear that Smoke had re-opened after a quite a hiatus.  I'll break my commentary down into three components for this one to be fair.

The Experience:

So, we started our on a bad foot.  After consulting Twitter/Facebook to find their address (an updated website would be a good start), we drove a couple circles around the 41st/42nd block of Butler Street looking for the building.  After a few attempts, we finally got out and walked it looking for a door number or sign, but no avail.  The only way we found it was a group of people walking out of the door we thought belonged to the neighboring theater with carry-out bags.  I'd suggest at least putting an address or a sign on the door (it would go a long way).

Getting inside, the place wasn't full, but we were told it would be around a 45 minute wait via NoWait (once again, it would of been nice to know they were using this anywhere on their site/social media presence).  Determined to give it a try, we waited about 30 minutes before being sat.

I will give Smoke props for their environment.  A good vibe, music selection and space lead to one of the more unique dining environments in Pittsburgh.  From here however, we had a varied ride.

The Service:

Approachable, yet brash (if that's even a possibility).  That's how I'd label the service.  Overlooking that factor, what really stood out here is HOW LONG it took for not only us, but all of the tables around us to get our food.  One hour for three tacos, mac & cheese and some slaw...  really?

The table to our left cancelled the remainder of their order and left and the two tables to our right complained pretty consistently about the time to receive their food as well.  Eventually our server brought out part of our order and apologized, but it still didn't make sense...  they're tacos.

The Food:

Here, I'll break it down into the good and the bad...

The Good - Brunch Special (biscuit and gravy), ChickenApple Taco and the Jalepeno Slaw.  While the gravy could have used a bit of seasoning (a consistent theme), the biscuit was rocking and the ChickenApple Taco was one of the more unique tacos I've ever had... kudos to those.

The Bad - The Migas Brisket (breakfast) Taco, Chorizo Taco and Mac and Cheese.  Once again, seasoning here would have saved these...  what should have been big flavor items ended up being super-bland.  For a smokehouse, I would of expected the brisket to be a lot better than it was and the Mac and Cheese could have used perhaps a few more stirs before being plated into the mini-cast-iron bowls (the flavor was pretty inconsistent bite-to-bite)

Overall, this has the makings of what could be a rocking place, but they need to get past the half-baked effort that we experienced.  We'll probably give it a few weeks for them update their sites, nail down their service and fine-tune their food, without some improvements, I don't see us going here again."}
{"text":"Out of the pork and the brisket tacos... go for the brisket. Super good taco, awesome decor!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite little restaurants in Pittsburgh. It's cash only, so be sure to bring cash, but know that it's totally worth the inconvenience of carrying around cash! They are moving locations to Lawrenceville soon, but for now they are located near the Waterfront, right on 8th in Homestead. It's really easy to find street parking, or there is a lot almost directly behind it.

The atmosphere is quaint and inviting. There can be a wait if you come during a peak time, but if you come closer to 11 on a weekend, you will be fine. Even if you have to wait a while, it is totally worth it!

One of my favorite things about Smoke is that it is BYOB! Hallelujah! Why aren't there more BYOB spots in Pittsburgh? Silly Pittsburgh.

The tacos are outrageously delicious, and I think they are worth every penny-about $4-$5 per taco. The sides are inexpensive as well, only $5 for the most filling, delicious mac and cheese you will ever taste in Pittsburgh, and around $3 for pinto beans with jalapenos, and apple jalapeno cole slaw.

The pulled chicken taco with avocado crema is my absolute favorite. I also love to get the veggie taco and add avocado crema.  Grilled veggies, black beans + avocado crema = heaven. The mac and cheese is out of this world. It is creamy smooth, and topped with crunchy bread crumbs and served in a mini cast iron dish. I can never even eat half of it as it is extremely rich, so I always take it home and enjoy leftovers the next day...or maybe later than evening.

I can't say enough about Smoke. It's delightful."}
{"text":"Hard place to find! We walked by it twice before finally finding it. We were meeting friends for dinner and drinks. We put our name in at 710, we were told an hour to an hour and a half wait, they don't have reservations and are all cash. We were fine with the wait and expected it ahead of time. We were put on a wait list and were told they would text us when the table was ready. We went down the road for drinks because that's a long wait and the restaurant is tiny. After 2 hours, we finally walk back to the restaurant because we never heard from them. We ask the front desk person and she insists that we opted out of the wait list?! We were mad because we didn't and had the text from them to prove it! She was very rude and had an attitude the entire time. Anyways, she added us back to the list and told us it'd be 15 minutes, we waited at the bar and had drinks. Finally she came up to us with an attitude to tell us our table was ready. Once we sat, we took a look at the menu. It was very high priced for the type of food and amount. It was about $7.50 for one taco. If you wanted to add anything on it, it was an extra charge and all sides were an extra charge. A side of Mac came to $9! When the waitress arrived, she told us that they were out of anything that had ribs in it, we were pretty upset. It was one of the main things we had wanted. We ended up getting brisket Mac & brisket tacos. They were good and filling. Standard is averagely 2 tacos per person. The Mac is enough for two people for sure! We won't be back. It was nice for a one time visit but just not worth it."}
{"text":"Smoke and I got off to a bit of a rocky start, as I made my initial pilgrimage there months ago only to find them closed, when the hours posted plainly said they were open. So they violated rule number one of The Good Restaurant Code, which is \"be open when you say you will be\", but I got over it and had lunch there yesterday. My first thought upon entering was that the place smelled heavenly. Nothing stimulates my appetitie like the aroma of smoked meats. My second thought was that I liked the decor, which is minimal but inviting, and my third was that, while they have space for more tables, there are only three, plus a couple of bar stools at the counter in back. The reason for that, I learned, is that they need to add another bathroom before they can add more tables. Damn health codes. 

The menu is brief and to the point. They make smoked meat tacos here, and they offer a few sides to go with your tacos. They also make their own flour tortillas. I find flour tortillas to be bland and uninteresting, so I don't get why they don't make corn tortillas instead, as corn are so much more flavorful. The woman who waited on us offered to make me corn tortillas, which was very nice, but I went with their original because I knew I'd be reviewing the place and wanted to try the house specialty. So I went for the pork taco with a side of pinto beans and the mango agua fresca. The agua fresca didn't taste much of mango, and was a tad too sweet, but I liked the lime zest floating on the top. The pulled pork taco was good, with meltingly caramelized onions that added sweetness and a spicy/sweet salsa that brought plenty of heat and flavor. I was looking for more smoke to the pork, but that's my only gripe. The flour tortilla was actually pretty good. I'm still not a big fan, but you can tell that these are homemade. The pinto beans are made with beer and had too much of that going on. My three star rating means I'll be going back to try more."}
{"text":"Smoke taqueria is incredible. Their chicken apple taco is not only my favorite taco in Pittsburgh but quite possibly my favorite thing to eat period! I've been going there since they were located in homestead. Was worried over time it would become not as good the more popular it got, but I was wrong!  Chicken apple taco, bacon Mac n cheese, and their queso are some of my favorites but have never had anything I didn't like."}
{"text":"Great lunch today at Smoke. Good craft beer list on tap to start things out. The special today was a smoked mushroom taco which was exceptional. The brisket was tasty but the mac and cheese was to die for."}
{"text":"Smoke: It is right by the waterfront, but easily passed up due to a small, unlit sign. The interior décor is a refurbished storefront with hardwood and modern vibe. As far as drinks go, its byob. I did not know that, next time. The aqua fresca is awesome if you have ever tried one, its cucumber juice with a hint of sugar. Super awesome. The horchata (rice milk and cinnamon) is also delice.

For an app, we got \"Frito Pie\" which is fritos topped with salsa, guac, sour cream, beans and some other junk. It was delightful, and filling for one person. The mixture of flavors was perfect.

We ordered a variety of tacos, with myself ordering the \"philly\", a brisket-esque taco that utilizes Smoke's barbequing skills. Once again, a plethora of flavors to satiate the pallet, with a decent sized, hand made tortilla, just slightly burned to perfection. My other taco was a spicy chicken variety, with apples in it I believe. The fruit really complemented the protein, though I would say the philly was my favorite by a marginal amount. We also ordered the mac and cheese with Chorizo, which is a must have. I do not remember what sort of cheese, but it was very wholesome, not your typical processed American cheese. This was quality Mac if I do say so myself, and most definitely worth ordering. The mixture of flavors make me want to return, with a case of Tecate, an empty stomach, and penchant for sampling the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Carnivore's heaven! We tried the duck quesadilla (my favorite), the brisket taco and the slaw. Delicious! The apricot infused hot sauce was awesome, too. An outstanding meal, especially for the price!

BYOB ($2.50 corking fee), cash only."}
{"text":"I dream about their chips and queso! Great tacos and plenty of options for vegetarians. I only wish there was a location closer to my house so I could go more often."}
{"text":"This is one of mine and my fiance's favorite places to eat. I see lots of complaints about long wait times, but I don't think we've ever had to wait! We've always gone at the right time or made reservations. Sometimes the brisket or pork can be a little on the dry side, but everything else on the taco makes up for it. We've never had a bad experience here and LOVE that they serve alcohol now. Definitely recommend the queso!"}
{"text":"Oh Pittsburgh.....
I think I might have ruined myself by living in California: I can't seem to find much good, innovative, FLAVORFUL food here.  Way more misses than hits as of late for me.
I understand the economics of a restaurant and that they need to turn a profit, but the price is too high for what you get...period.  I'm not a cheapskate or a poor student, I just know the flavor/quantity/price balance is off.  There's innovation here, but it could go SO much farther with a few simple tweaks.  I'm know by some people as somewhat of a 'big eater' but when I went I wasn't that hungry, and ate 5 tacos plus fritos and queso, and could have eaten a bunch more.
To their credit, the roast pork was good, but it didn't have anything else to set it off, no other textures or flavors to accompany.  Also props on making their own bacon, I hope you like it extra smokey tho.  I might return to try the things they were out of when I was there, the chicken and brisket, but it will only be for a snack
The reason they got 3 stars instead of 2: THE HORCHATA!  Super excellent, I'm more likely to stop by for a to-go horchata than anything else."}
{"text":"If I would give this place 10 stars I would.  While I've enjoyed my time in Pittsburgh, Mexican food is not a strong point of this city.  Smoke gives me that great down-south feeling, like I'm back in the dirty-third (Houston, Texas for the uninformed).  I love it.

The menu is simple, the prices are cheap, the food presentation is bare bones, the execution is tremendous.  Breakfast tacos available for dinner?  Amazing.  The veggie tacos are fantastic as well.  The selection of sauces is fantastic, not to mention sufficiently spicy for one with a seemingly desensitized mucosal lining.  Fantastic drink choices abound including horchata. What is perhaps the best part of this restaurant is the pricing!  So cheap, especially when considering the high quality food you're getting.  Don't forget to order up some Mac n Cheese.  While not Mexican, it's comfort food that is well done and well worth it.  

My only critique about this place is that I've been meaning to eat here for damn near 6 months but the only time I've actually been successful despite numerous attempts was on a weekday at 5:30 PM.  They don't take reservations, and frankly it's a pain in the tush to have to wait for over an hour in homestead waiting for a seat.  They really need to take reservations because this wait thing has completely gotten out of hand.  Do yourself a favor and go during an off-peak hour."}
{"text":"Burnt ends salad with crumbly blue cheese!  Just do it!!! Gunpowder Irish Gin available for a cocktail!  Haven't seen that spirit since Ireland! And yes, those are tater tots on the salad!  Mike had a burnt ends taco.  Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't go here if you are super hunger the tacos come singular so it really adds up. Wish that their specials were veggie more. Food as been good every time will continue to go back."}
{"text":"I went on burger night therefore the menu was limited but it was nice and they had a few non-burger options. Also there was no wait for a table around 8pm. I had the appetizer fries with brisket and it was more than enough food to fill me up. I also had the Big Fiz tobdrink (St. Germaine and grapefruit cocktail) and found it to be so light and refreshing. It's a great summer cocktail and perfect to lighten up a big heavy meaty meal."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great offerings with a barbecue twist. Best Mac n cheese I have ever tasted. Great service. Nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"This place has the best tacos I've ever had.  A few of them are on the spicy side, so make sure you order something you can deal with.  There's not a single item here that is sub-par."}
{"text":"I don't usually eat mac n cheese. But when my daughter kept saying how good it was, I tried it. It WAS delicuous! So was the brisket salad and potato salad.  A+  NOTE. Byob and cash only"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious tacos. Had the brisket and the supreme chicken. A little expensive but you absolutely get what you pay for."}
{"text":"The food here is spectacular.  So why only a 3-star rating?  It's because of Smoke's disrespectful and blatant misuse of the NoWait system for getting a table.   When you call ahead (and yes, you're going to need to call ahead) for a table, they get your phone number, and you'll get a text message prompting you to install the NoWait app on your phone.

Normally, I avoid installing apps on my phone, but I figured I'd make an exception.  NoWait is kind of cool in that you can see how many parties are ahead of you, and what the estimated wait time is.   Well that seems nice, as I don't have to sit around waiting in the lobby of the restaurant.   It started out with 8 parties ahead of me with an estimated 60-75 minute wait.   Eventually it made it down to 6 parties ahead of me, but still with an estimated 60-75 minute wait.  And then I got a text saying that my table is ready, and if I don't get there within 10 minutes, they'll give the table to somebody else!  As I was running to the location, I glanced at my phone and there were still 6 parties ahead of me in line!

When we got to Smoke, they had mentioned that while they use NoWait for their own wait list management and also text notification system.  However, they do *NOT* use NoWait as it's *SUPPOSED* to be used by keeping the wait info updated.   The result is that everybody that uses NoWait to check on the wait status of Smoke is surprised.   So while the two of us made it in time, the other two in our party would not have been able to make it in the 10 minute window from having received the text message.   If we got back on the list, it would have been more than an additional hour to wait.   So we told them to not bother showing up.

Smoke:   Either use NoWait, and use it completely, or don't use it at all!   What you're doing now is disrespectful to the customers, and I could imagine it even causing yourselves undue headaches.   While we were waiting for our now 2-top opening, I overheard you explain the NoWait situation to pretty much everybody else who showed up.  How does this not get old to you, and how have you not realized that it's a problem?

Anyway, I'll likely be back because I love the tacos so much.  But my girlfriend has mentioned that she won't ever come back, solely because of the NoWait fiasco.  And I will definitely be hesitant to suggest it to friends until the problem is addressed."}
{"text":"Went on Burger Tuesday. Sat at the bar. Food was phenomenal although my burger was kind of falling apart.  Great beer selection and a really good cocktail list with fresh juices."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this place today on my never-ending quest for decent tacos in Pittsburgh, and I wasn't disappointed! 

Pleasant decor, an interesting menu, friendly service, and excellent food. The horchata was clearly homemade and tasty although a little week, and the tacos were delicious. I had the pork, chicken, and vegetarian tacos on corn tortillas and would highly recommend both the pork and chicken. The vegetarian was decent but paled in comparison to the others. 

My only slight complaint is that all the tacos came wrapped up in foil which seems kind of wasteful - I would prefer to see them served on standard plates. Also, the time it takes to receive the tacos is quite long!

I will definitely be back in the future!"}
{"text":"Although Smoke used to be tacos only, they've recently expanded and started offering burgers on Tuesdays, brunch menu on Sunday, and on other days barbecue plates and pulled pork sandwiches. The side dishes here are some of my favorite things -- try the queso which comes with delicious homemade soft tortilla chips, or the brocollini and corn which is my hands-down favorite! I tried the pulled pork sandwich for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and it was delicious on a home made soft brioche bun. If you're in the mood for tacos, try the migas, chicken apple, or pork. They now have a full bar -- wine, beer, and cocktails.

Note that they are only open for lunch on Fridays currently.

I wish it was a little quieter inside sometimes as it makes it difficult to carry on a conversation, but love the place otherwise."}
{"text":"So where do I begin. May 22, 2017  we decided to take a large group for dinner. We went to the website and emailed per the website is we had to email them with 8 or more in our group. I sent the email and received a reply stating we would have seats ready at 730pm.  Going back and forth updating the amount of people in our party, they confirmed us for 730 for 14 people. We arrived around 650pm, with 10 minutes to spare. The person at the front counter stated he didn't know about our reservation. And also stated the website doesn't sync with their in-shop program. We waited an extra 30 minutes to be seated. We finally were seated. The waitress started to take our drink orders and explained the menu. We received our drinks within a few minutes. We stated to order, and our waitress said, no, we are out of chicken and ribs. She was getting rude with our group. We decided to leave due to being treated terrible. After deciding on a different restaurant, we shockingly received an email  from the programs that won't communicate with each other, stating how sorry they were they didn't have our table, and they offered to comp a bottle of wine upon out return. 

1. I would not recommend this place to anyone hungry. 
2. The host stated we needed to come in to make our reservations instead of using THEIR website. 

I am very disappointed in this business!!!!!!! It's 2017 and there are still shady restaurants out there."}
{"text":"Smoke's new location in Lawrenceville is somewhat hidden for now until they get signage.  Not going to lie, I walked right by it twice.  But in case you need to know, it is right next to Row House Cinema on Butler Street.  Depending on when you go in, it might be packed to the gills or empty with only a few patrons.  I was lucky enough to find only two other patrons at the bar when I stopped in one random weekday afternoon after exploring a few other shops in the neighborhood.  

I'd been to Smoke's previous Homestead location so I knew what to expect.  Cash only with just a few items to choose from.  Nothing too crazy as far as tacos but the combination of ingredients will usually awaken the taste buds.  I went with tres tacos: the chorizo, chicken and brisket.  All were delightful, but just like my last Smoke experience I felt like it was a little pricey.  Service was friendly and I didn't wait long, but I'm sure when there's a line of people out the door service isn't as friendly, fast or efficient.  

I want to try the mac n cheese but haven't yet, mostly because, again, I'm turned off by the cost ($7 for what doesn't look like a very big portion).  If/when I return, it will be the first thing I order.  I hope to update my review with an extra star after a taste."}
{"text":"Now I've been a fan of Smoke for quite a few years now. The place is unreal. Everything I've ever had their is just to die for good. Can't go wrong on Tuesday for Burger only night and then every other night the tacos are the way to go! So many different options and they always have a special that is extremely good! Whenever someone says hey let's go to smoke I never say no."}
{"text":"Looking for great tacos. ....head here. The meat is fresh and great tortillas. I had the rib taco and the sirloin (brisket wasn't ready yet). Both were very good but I think the rib taco is hard to beat. My sister had the migas and said it was very good.  I have had their mac and cheese prior to this visit and it's hard to beat. Only reason 4 and not 5 stars....the chips that come with queso are fried flour and hold a lot of grease."}
{"text":"Smoke has great food, but it can be difficult to get a table. Considering that they serve tacos, it's also a bit expensive. The flavor is worth the price though, just be sure to make a reservation or have 1-3 hours to wait for a table!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious.  The chicken apple tacos are my personal favorite.  I've been there a few times since they've opened and have yet to have bad service.  My only complaint would be the size of the restaurant.  It's a little small but they are still a 5 star in my book."}
{"text":"I stopped in here on a whim with a friend for an early dinner a couple of days ago. I feel like Smoke has been on my list for ages, but with the ridiculous wait times there always seems to be an easier option. I'm happy to have tried it during a non-peak time! 

We walked in and were given a choice of seating by the host. She was a bit snappish, but I brushed it off. We chose the bar. The bartender was super friendly. She took our food orders and was quite attentive at the start of our visit. I had the pork taco and my friend had one of the chicken tacos and a side of some sort. I believe it had corn and asparagus. My taco was divine. It had juicy chunks of shredded pork with a flavorful BBQ sauce and some sautéed onions. Everything worked well together without being too messy. Two would have been a full meal for me, but one was perfect for the light dinner I was craving. The beer list looked great, and I will be taking advantage of it in the near future. 

We didn't end up receiving a check, so we just left cash plus a tip on the bar. I wish someone would have checked in and asked us how we liked our food and such, but that's my only complaint. The staff was clearly preparing for the dinner rush and had other things to do. At any rate, the food was delicious and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I ended up here on Burger Tuesday over the summer, which was a little disappointing considering I really wanted tacos. However, I quickly got passed my disappointment after tasting the burger. It was to die for! I'm amazed that a taco place can do burgers this well. 

I've also had the tacos on another occasion and believe it or not, they are even better than the burgers. They are full of flavor but don't have too many ingredients (I find that some places try to add too much to make their tacos interesting). 

The food was excellent, the service was good and the location is prime! The only cons are that it's cash only and doesn't accept reservations."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Especially the brisket taco and omg their queso is addictive. Great ambiance too. Food in Pittsburgh is truly fantastic."}
{"text":"We have always loved this place for the delicious queso, homemade chips, and smoked tacos. However, we recently stumbled in on a Tuesday, which is Burgers only night. We were skeptical at first, but stayed anyway. WOW, were we wrong. This is hands down the best burger in the Pittsburgh area. My only complaint is that they don't broadcast this awesome feature. Will be back for more burgers!"}
{"text":"I've tried a whole lot of taco places, but I can say without hesitation, this is my favorite! I know that's a little bold, so let me back that up:
Their Queso and Chips are next level. This isn't some orangey goop that tastes cheese-like... It is LOADED with cheese, and other things depending which kind you order. If you can, the Burnt Ends queso is life-changing, you should order it! It's got poblano peppers, pulled pork... All the good stuff. And I'm not a chips girl, but these were unique! They were crispy yet chewy, but also light and airy. Hands-down the best chips & queso!
I had a Tom Collins, which was good, but what surprised me was their House-made Cola that my friend ordered. It tasted like an in-between of Cola and root beer. I don't even really like sodapop, but this was fantastic.
Now... Let's talk Tacos! The special was a Fried Chicken taco with bacon and garlic mayo. This taco could have used a slight change to the ingredients ratio (both my friend and I agreed ours were dominated by the fried chicken). 
The Shrooms Taco, however, was nothing short of glorious. The smoky, umami mushrooms were perfect in taste and texture. Everything else in the taco played nicely together and created a lively balance. 100% recommended!
We left stuffed, but didn't regret a thing. I'm already planning on bringing my other friends to try this fantastic taco joint!"}
{"text":"The signs say \"no reservations\", but the restaurant uses the No Wait App. Don't waste an hour and a half of your life watching customers with doggie bags chat over their empty plates like I did. 

There is almost no waiting space inside, so be prepared to go elsewhere while you wait for your table. The interior has muted lighting and a warm color palette. Be sure to look at the open kitchen. The fresh baked bread smelled delicious. 

I had to catch my movie, so I didn't get a $6 taco (yes, a single taco), but I did get to try the mac and cheese with brisket on top. I was disappointed by the portion (similar size to Panera's mac for 1.5x the price). The flavor made up for the small portion, cheesy noodly goodness with soft, seasoned brisket. Yum yum. 

Next time I'll be prepared with the No Wait App. Smoke has caught my interest, I'll keep you updated."}
{"text":"As much as I want to give it 5 stars, I just can't.  4.5 would be perfect, but alas...

As others have said, definitely worth the trip to Homestead, and a a perfect stop for lunch if you're already down at the Waterfront.

First off, the space is fantastic.  Certainly what I'd expect from a locovore tacqueria, complete with mismatched tables and copies of \"dwell\" there for perusal while you wait for your food.  This scene is straight out of Lawrenceville.  Definitely very comfortable and welcoming though, with a friendly and accommodating staff.

On to the food.  The tacos are indeed excellent, with the variety of BBQ'd meat being what's showcased.  The pork, ribs and brisket were all very well cooked and full of flavor.  The specific sauce for each complimented them well, and did not overpower the natural flavors of the protein.  Also, kudos for not covering them in guacamole or sour cream...a frequent crutch for those with sub-standard flavoring in the taco itself.  The breaksfast tacos our also outstanding.  The perfect combination of egg, cheese, salsa, beans and your choice of meat.  

The drinks are a great addition. Homemade lemonade and agua fresca accompany the tacos perfectly.  And who can't be pumped for the ever-elusive Mexican coke?  Of course, BYOB is always a nice touch for those interested in a few beers with their taco feast.

Now for where I think Smoke falls short of 5 stars: the sides.  Yes, the chili is quite good.  But the mac and cheese simply is not.  I'm sorry to say it...but it's the truth.  In principle, it sounds great with roasted garlic, marscapone and super sharp white cheddar.  In practice, however, it falls flat.  The flavor balance is just off, with the sharp cheddar coming off as bitter and even a bit funky.  The beans are good, but really, the sides are the only place the menu leaves something to be desired.

Bottom line, this is a great stop, and better than a majority of Mexican-inspired fare found around the 'Burgh.  I mean, any place where you go back the morning after you were there just so you can get the breakfast taco has to be pretty good."}
{"text":"After years of hearing that I *need* to dine at Smoke, I finally found the perfect opportunity on a recent chilly Pittsburgh Saturday afternoon.  My friend and I stopped in for lunch and joined a couple of other solo diners at the large, wooden bar situated in the middle of the room.  The smoky smell that hits you as soon as you walk in is downright intoxicating.  Smoke offers a very broad menu and I thought I was going to have trouble deciding on what to get, until the bartender shared the day's specials with us.  There were several options but I blacked out as soon as the words \"Cuban taco\" left his mouth.  Two of my absolute favorite foods in one delicious mashup?  Umm YES PLEASE.  While we waited for our food, my friend and I each sipped on a house gin cocktail.  I was impressed with the taste and serving size and thought it aligned well with the $12 price tag.  

The Cuban taco was everything I could've hoped and dreamed for.  Honestly, this needs to be on the regular menu.  I somehow managed to snap a photo of it for my Snapchat story before digging in, and I got SO many inquiries as to where I was.  The taco was pressed just like a real Cuban should be, making it somewhat of a quesadilla. Everything inside, from the meat to the pickles, was perfectly portioned and flavorful.  The taco itself was the just the right size for a lunch that wasn't overly filling.  I wanted to try the mac and cheese but I'm watching my carb intake (wahh) and thought better of it... this time at least.  Instead, my friend and I shared the broccolini and corn with brisket which was quite good! 

I definitely see why people love this place and I'm glad I finally got to check it out without a 2 hour wait standing in my way.

Loved my meal, loved the cocktails... but for the love of God, put that Cuban taco on the menu!"}
{"text":"It was 85 degrees and humid today and there was no AC on.  It was miserable and even hotter inside. I stayed because I remembered how good the food had been when Smoke was in Homestead, but was so nauseous from the heat by the time the food came, I couldn't eat much of it.  Why is this place being so cheap?  Turn the AC on!"}
{"text":"classy and fabulous. I'm from California and I know my tacquerias and Mexican food, but combining that with bbq is brilliant. Very inteligent mix use of herbs and spices with quality meat. I'm not a bbq expert but I found all food quite good. Nice beer selection. Charming staff.  Very smart ambience. This was my first spot on visiting the gph, straight from Oakland CA and I was impressed."}
{"text":"Usually, I give places like this a 5 star unless you make my local foodie mad which the bar server did, so you get 4.

Super excited to finally see smoke open up in Lawrenceville after their presence in the Waterfront proved underappreciated. Came on a Saturday night, so we waited for a little bit [40 minutes is normal] before getting seated at the bar [something KB and I actually prefer] The place is warm and inviting, decked out in wood and engulfed in some of the most their elaborate aromas from their chorizo, to their tacos, and mac & cheese. 

We had been eating and drinking our way through Lville from Slice to AWM, so we ordered small. KB had the mac & cheese and a side of the broccolini [her faves], and I had a the taco special which was a chicken with arugula, strawberries, blue cheese and pecans [pretty much my favorite salad dumped into a taco]

The mac&cheese is awesome. It's heavy and creamy with thick, sharp cheeses, a dousing of pepper and breadcrumbs that much makes you as happy as a 5 year old with a blue box. And there is a healthy portion of it. Honestly, it's called a side, but this clearly could be your entire meal. The broccolini was similar, doused with cheese and breadcrumbs, not leaving much to the delicate vegetable dish you may have been expecting. Unfortunately, this dish was a bit disappointing as most of what you taste is smoke. It completely overpowers the vegetable and put a sad pairing taste to the wine [the place is BYOB] we had brought from AWM. [we weren't expecting that flavoring in our Italian greens]

The taco was nice, I loved the blend of the pecan and blue cheese and offset with the strawberries and pepperiness of the arugula. It was also a nice size for a taco. Mounds of fillings. There is a lot of cheese clumped right in the middle, which was a shame, less would have been better, and it would have made the dish overall less heavy. 

The disappearing star went for the attitude of our bar server. She started out great and helpful with specials and uncorking our wine. The checked in regularly and stopped an appropriate amount of time in order to start a tat of conversation with each patron. However, that's when things turned sour. 

We had gotten into conversation about the evening and logically, the wine that we had dragged half way across Lawrenceville for here specifically. She seemed intrigued as KB mentioned it to be one of her more preferred and then offered her a taste. She accepted, poured herself a small bit, tasted it, and complimented it as a polite patron no matter her personal taste. 

Then she asked for feedback on food. Naturally, as foodies, we love giving it. 

We noted lovely blend of cheeses and consistency of the m&c, the unique twist on the broccolini, and I expressed my concern for the amount of blue cheese that was overpowering the taco. With each remark her blatant 'F-U' face became more and more visible. Now, we love this place and want to see it thrive so, we would have believed that feedback that had more depth than just \"It's great\" would be welcomed. We were wrong. By the end she seemed positively irked, decided it was time to move to other diners, turned, and violently dumped out the rest of the wine. Message received. 

We decided the desert was best to go [but it was truly amazing pie - and was devoured later that morning], rounding out our dinner before we made out for the grapparia for a digestion drink. 

All in all, this place is an above average establishment for food and atmosphere, as long as you adjust your expectation to a trendy Lville hotspot [waits and attitude] and definitely a place that will [and has been] returned to."}
{"text":"We were so obsessed with Smoke that we HAD to go back again for Father's day. This time, we brought the boyf's mom and dad as well. This experience- was a lot different than the first, unfortunately.

We started off with their queso- I had heard it was amazing and was super excited to try it. It definetly was a big bowl of cheese- the portion was pretty big and was enough to share with a larger group of people. But the flavor.. was lacking immensely. The cheese dip was almost completely flavorless besides the peppers and cilantro that were scarce throughout the dip. I took the leftover dip home and even doctoring it up didn't add much to it.. needless to say, I was very disappointed. The chips were homemade, which I greatly appreciated, but were also flavorless. My boyfriend's mom loved them though, so I gave her the remaining chips to take home.

One thing I don't like about this place that I didn't notice last time- they really don't have many drinks at all. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE that they are BYOB- it's completely awesome! But I didn't even think about their selection of non-alcoholic drinks. If I am not drinking alcohol at a restaurant, it's water for me, all of the time. But my boyfriend's parents always get pop and were a little disappointed that there were none available. They ordered their homemade lemonade and enjoyed it- but I do agree that some soda should be offered- even if it's only in glass bottle form. 

Our entire party ordered 4 orders of mac & cheese and almost everyone ordered a taco. I ordered the chicken and apple taco that I loved so much the first time I had it (I had been dreaming about that taco ever since). My boyfriend ordered that as well. My boyfriend loved his- I was disappointed in mine. It was drenched in the smoked jalapeno mayo. To the point where it was a little difficult to eat. The mayo is delicious, don't get me wrong... but sometimes too much of a good thing, makes it not so good anymore. It took away the other flavors and just overpowered the entire taco. The mac & cheese was different this time too! It wasn't as flavorful as it was the last time. My sister (who admittedly is a picky eater) had a couple bites and couldn't eat any more. My dad enjoyed his. The one thing I will say is the portion of the mac & cheese is awesome- and I love the crumb filled top. My mom and dad had to doctor up their mac & cheese leftovers by adding a lot more flavor, since it lacked so much in that department. I did the same thing with my leftovers, which made the mac & cheese bearable. My boyfriend's family liked their food, but weren't blown away either.

I do not want to give this place 3 stars, but I have to. The fact that the two experiences at Smoke were so drastically different is super disappointing. The food should be consistent- not different each time you go. 

I would like to return again, but I won't be running there anytime soon. Their desserts sound incredible and I have been too full each time I had visited to try any- so maybe dinner elsewhere and a drink and dessert at Smoke will be my next trip."}
{"text":"The best. Hands down. Awesome service. Fresh. Made from scratch. Mouthwatering. Probably the best in Pennsylvania"}
{"text":"Started out with the drink special of the day, sangria. It arrived with lots of ice and was quite literally tasteless here. What was worse is we were charged $10 for them. Water in glasses on table with no ice. Not a portent of what's to come. 
Thankfully, the food was delicious. Mac & cheese, corn & broccolini, check. Brisket & burnt ends, mustard & coffee bbq sauces check. Service check. 
Donuts were the dessert special. Strawberry/Meyer lemon glaze & a marscapone concoction were so sugary sweet that one could not taste the donut at all. These were $3 & $5. Approximately $75.00 for two, with major negative of CASH ONLY. Go for the food and maybe a beer. Ditch the cocktail and dessert."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is amazing. The burnt ends are the best and the mac and cheese is better. Every time I travel to Pittsburgh I eat at smoke."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!! In Pittsburgh for the weekend and my friend has been harassing me to try this place for the longest. St Patty's Day celebrations tonight and I chose to go here. It was packed of course but we waited a couple of minutes before being seated at the bar. I ordered the chorizo taco, pork taco, pinto beans, and a margarita. My friend ordered the veggie taco, egg taco and the Mac n cheese. The chorizo taco and the Mac n cheese are to die for. The chorizo is spicy and I love spicy food. The pork taco was really good too just had a sweet sauce. I ordered black beans for some reason was given pinto but I was alright with it. No big deal. I would absolutely come back to this restaurant for tacos."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I ordered the brisket sandwich with sharp provolone, pickled onions and aioli.  The brisket was really tasty (as it always is, I usually get the brisket tacos).  The real star of the show was the homemade brioche buns.  Made the whole sandwich.  One of the best buns I've tasted. 

Also had the $5 margarita for happy hour.  Very light and refreshing. 

Great visit!"}
{"text":"Smoke has finally won my heart. I first started coming to smoke when they were in Homestead and liked the character of the place but didn't like the small size and limited selection. I've gone to smoke 5 or 6 times and my experiences just get better. Most recently I ordered take out but decided to eat in; I had one of their taco specials along with chips/queso. The taco was heavenly, like pouring liquid satisfaction in my mouth and the chips are best eaten compulsively to the point of crapulence. I seldom give out 5 stars, but smoke has earned it."}
{"text":"I was only here for a very quick late night bite after Art All Night. They were closing shortly but allowed us to come in for a taco and drink and it was a great way to cap off the night. The tacos were deliciously spicy (which I love). Not everyone in my group did though, so unfortunately it wasn't a great experience for the lesser spiced pallet. 

The only thing that could have made it better would have been a beer special!"}
{"text":"Finally!  The new space is phenomenal, and we didn't think the food could get any better, but....It did! Had the rib taco and the brisket taco - Outstanding.  Also had the slaw and the black beans, so fresh and tasty.  They know how to cook.  Really.  Thanks.  You may want to call ahead for a reservation - it gets packed!"}
{"text":"When looking for new restaurants to try, two things that particularly appeal to me are culinary innovation and convenience of location.  Smoke (at least, at their Homestead location) has both in spades.

I ordered the chicken apple and smoked salmon tacos, and both were excellent.  Both packed flavor combinations (savory/sweet and savory/creamy) that melded together perfectly.  I would recommend ordering two tacos for a meal, as they're a bit on the small side, however.  My dining companion also ordered the black beans, which had a soupy consistency and were a bit too spicy for me.

As a macaroni and cheese connoisseur, I had to order the mac and cheese as a side, based on the recommendations in the other reviews.  Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed, since I found the white cheddar cheese sauce too mild and thin for my taste (rating: 6.0/10).  The taco crumbles on top did add a welcome salty/crunchy note (I'm a fan of bread crumbs on my mac and cheese).  When it comes to mac and cheese, I'm a traditionalist, preferring the bolder taste of sharp cheddar and thicker sauce.  Needless to say, these are my personal preferences, however, so feel free to take them with a grain of salt.

This place is BYOB, so based on another reviewer's suggestion, I brought some Jose Cuervo and ordered margarita mix to go with it.  The sweet but not-overly-so margaritas complemented the meal quite nicely.

My dining companion and I visited on a Sat. evening in Feb. right after it had snowed.  We waited 20-30 min., since another party arrived right before us claimed the last empty table.  The space in Homestead was tiny (it had about 6-7 tables), so I hope that the one in Lawrenceville will be larger.  I wish the owners great success in their new location. 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"I went here to try something new, it's always packed and filled with cool people. 

You walk in and it's rustic shabby chic. The place smells like smoke as they have the barbecue smoker in the middle of the restaurant

There isn't a lot of seating. There is seating in the front and a bar in the back which they never let people use. I had to sit at the bar and it was packed and uncomfortable.

The menu is small and the tacos are $6 or more for one. I tried the chicken and brisket tacos and ordered their cornbread. I waited 40 uncomfortable minutes then finally got them.

The food looked nice but was just OK. My taco meat was.... how do I say this..... DRY.
I would expect for the price and being homemade barbecue meat that it be tender and super flavorful. My cornbread was hot, a little burnt and OK.

When I was done I got the bill and a note saying, CASH ONLY. I didn't have any cash so I had to use their ATM in the back? Just get a credit card machine?

Anyway, I left feeling annoyed, ripped off and I smelled like smoke."}
{"text":"Smoke is great. My go to is the chicken taco (which is delectable) and a side of slaw (great and spicy). Their happy hour special is dangerous. The drinks are strong and go down easy. This is one of our go-to spots for a solid meal."}
{"text":"My girlfriend never stops making excuses to go to Homestead now that this place is there. But I fancy it quite a bit myself. The staff is extremely friendly and always very accommodating to our vegetarian needs. I get a sort of breakfast taco (available at night!) with eggs and potatoes that is fantastic. Their queso dip quirkily served with fritos is to die for. And let's not forget the life changingly good mac and cheese. Definitely go here!"}
{"text":"I recently just moved to Pittsburgh from Texas and I was very apprehensive at first to try tacos in the area but my friend was persistent that this would be the place to match the authenticness of Texas tacos and I have to (grudgingly) admit he was right. I ordered the chicken with avocado and sour cream and the Migas. Perfect blend of spices and it definitely hit the spot! My friend got the Parmesan but it was more of an acquired taste(I took a bite but was not a fan). The ambiance is not bad either(avoid going after 6:30 that's when it gets crowded).Overall, I was very impressed, would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"smoke has been a favorite since first bite, i have been back at least 4 times to enjoy the soft, spicy, smokey deliciousness. my favorite tacos were veggie (with the avocado sauce, meaty in it's own way!), ribs (the pickles added just enough crunch & vinegar to balance out the spicy meat) and brisket. the pork taco was a bit spicy for me on the day i tried it, but still had great, bold flavor. the sauce on the mac cheese was perfectly balanced, definitely go all out & get the bacon on it. agua fresca can't be beat, so refreshing. 

small space but great atmosphere, i like the simple decorations & the overall feel. waitstaff was friendly, food came out in timely manner. 

i highly recommend smoke."}
{"text":"This place haunts my dreams, in a good way of course. 

It is honestly the best tacos I've had in Pittsburgh, and probably up there in the top 10 of my life. Now, Mexican is not my usual go-to food, but I will go to this place every time it is an option! 

It especially gets points from me for their mac & cheese and location! Way to try and revive a part of town that needs help!!"}
{"text":"Best bbq in the city! You can throw a dart at the menu and will not he disappointed. They have a brunch menu on Sunday and do burger night on Tuesday. Everything I have had so far has been great. They also recently switched over to a larger menu which has a bbq sampler, sandwiches and still tacos too. If you are on Butler street this place is a must to check out!"}
{"text":"This place has good food...if you can get it. They either have an hours long wait, are out of everything, or closed. Seems like they need some fine-tuning in overall restaurant management. They've been open a little too long to still be having the problems they have.

Update: I was back at Smoke this week and it was a much better experience. It was a Thursday night and we were seated and greeted right away. They were not out of anything we wanted and everything was fresh and delicious. I had the Gringo and BLT taco and both were fantastic. The BLT taco was off the menu for awhile, but it is back and I am excited!"}
{"text":"Went back again today. We called to put our name on the list and were told to get there in an hour, but when we got there, we waited 40 minutes for a table. The Dining room was not full, in fact, people were walking out and tables were left empty, but no one was being seated. About half an hour into wait time, the hostess apologized for the wait and said that she couldn't seat us until she got the 'go ahead' from the kitchen. 10 minutes later, another woman came to the hostess and told her she could seat only 3 people at a time, and the wait one for every 3 person group was 20 minutes. I don't know what's going on with this place, but it's the second time that we've been here and they have kitchen issues. The tacos are good, but the kitchen just cannot seem to get their act together. Very unprofessional. I gave them the benefit of the doubt the first time, but the second time (and this is months later, in fact, almost a year later), I definitely won't be going back to smoke"}
{"text":"This restraints looks very nice and rustic. I went in with a party of six and it was a two hours wait when no one else was waiting to be seated. I looked in the website before coming in seeing if a reservation had to be made,nope!  But the lady at the counter said yes, for parties for six or more a reservation would have to be made. Hopefully I can try this place again soon to try the food, not the service."}
{"text":"Good, but not great.  The pork taco with apricot jalapeño sauce was fantastic, but everything was just average.  Wouldn't recommend highly.  Takeout service was fast and efficient though."}
{"text":"Smoke is on the top 25 (34) list of the best restaurants in the burgh and it shows. I joined a large group (7 of us) for dinner on a recent Saturday night. We called ahead and were able to get in within about half an hour. Yes, Smoke is on the main road in Homestead. Seems like an odd area but obviously, people still go there. It's a tiny little place so you have to really look to not pass it by. I started my meal with the aqua fresca for the day- watermelon. Yum. Every sip tasted like I was biting into a rip, juicy watermellon on a warm summer day. Speaking of warm, the ventilation is pretty poor. The majority of the table was quite toasty while I was comfortable due to sitting directly on top of the floor vent. 
The table then shared some chips with queso. The chips were phenomenal.Obviously homemade. The queso didn't do much for me. I felt it as rather plain. It took quite a while to get our tacos. Upwards of 15 minutes. Tacos don't seem to be very time consuming to make . . . Anyway, when our order arrived, I eagerly chomped into my first choice, the chorizo. Chorizo sausage, beans and pico. Holy cow! The temperature in the room just shot up 10 degrees. Now, I am a fan of spice. But, in a moderate to high amount. Not in a \"I'd like to burn my lips off today \"amount. Despite the almost unbearable heat, I trucked through and finished the entire taco. Once you got past the heat, the flavors were incredible. Only one other person at the table ordered the chorizo and after seeing my reaction, she took some of the peppers off of the taco before she even attempted to eat it. Smart move since she felt that it was hot but in a pleasant way. Not sure if this was a quality control issue or if they really are THAT hot. If that is the case, it should definitely be shown on the menu. 
My next selection was the chicken taco. Some of the others at the table felt that the chicken was a bit spicy. Seriously? Compared to the chorizo, it was a 2 on a scale of 1-10 where the chorizo was a 15. The avocado seriously cooled down any spice from the hot sauce on the taco. Hubs and I also shared the mac and cheese. I really don't see the appeal. It was creamy, smooth and tasty but it didn't blow my mind like other reviews suggested. When the meal was finished, the waitress gave us all one check. We asked to have it separated and she told us the would take care of it at the register. So, we took turn going up by couple to explain what we got. When all was said and done, they were a bit short but they let it go. I feel like that could have been much easier had we gotten seperate checks by couple. 
Overall, I might head back to Smoke. My only hesitation comes from my issue with the chorizo taco. The heat was just too much for my body to handle and I ended up feeling sick for several hours. Yes, I know I ate it and I am to blame. But, if it was intended to be that spicy, it should be designated as such on the menu. If it was not supposed to be that spicy, then there is a quality control issue. Regardless, I now have a bad association which tainted my overall experience."}
{"text":"Definitely get the mac n cheese. My favorite taco was the pork.  It's filled with a good amount and it's really juicy.  We also tried the chicken, chicken apple, chorizo, and steak. Also, the agua fresca is so refreshing! 

Only gripe is the wait time for food.  We waited over 40 minutes to get food.  So my suggestion; order chips and queso so you have something to eat while you wait."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious tacos, with house made tortillas and the freshest ingredients."}
{"text":"Went on a double date here on Friday, it did not seem super busy and we were told 1-1.5 hour wait this was at 6:15pm. At 8:00 our table still was not ready and the hostess was rude and definitely did not care, even rolled her eyes when we asked how much longer. We came back at 8:30pm, still no table (even though there were clearly two empty tables) and hostess seemed to had misplaced someone's food pick up order. After she found their food she said we'd be seated in two minutes, it's now 8:50, she went in back and then sat us a little after 9:00pm. 

The queso with burnt ends was delicious and we enjoyed our margaritas. The tacos we ordered all seemed overly spicy, so much that we couldn't enjoy the flavor of the other ingredients. 

A side note: Our server mentioned that it had been a slow night for business, to which we told her we waited almost 3 hours. She was shocked. Just felt very inefficient and poorly run."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted. The brisket tacos are perfect. However waiting for then for an hour is not acceptable. If I want tacos I'm going to las palmas on Atwood. I was also put off by the waiter not receptive to us being disappointed by an hour long wait for food."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE! 

Frescas, salads, tacos, bacon, BYOB. Yum! The staff is awesome. I've been here several times and I think about the BLT taco in between. Love their breakfast tacos, the brisket taco, BBQ taco, queso with FRITOS!... actually I've seriously loved everything I've gotten here. And while I love food, and can be easily amused, Smoke continues to enthrall me time after time."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for this place is absurd. The tacos are incredible, my favorite is the chicken apple taco but I've had plenty and liked them all. The mac n cheese is some of the best I've ever had, and the queso + pita chips is literally addicting I always ruin my meal eating them all."}
{"text":"I'm psyched to give Smoke 4 stars after having Saturday lunch there two weeks in a row. Highlights include friendly service, delicious food, menu variety, fun atmosphere, and drink specials. I really enjoyed the burnt ends taco and the salad with pork and avocado. The Hot A.F. sauce is actually pretty mild but the Fresno hot sauce is plenty spicy. Good for couples, families, and small groups. Cash only."}
{"text":"We went here in May for dinner before my bachelorette party. We called ahead for a reservation as we had about 10 people and knew the restaurant was small and busy. Even with the reservation, we waited about 20 minutes to be seated. Service continued to be slow. The restaurant was rather warm and could use better air flow. 
Despite these apparently common issues at this spot, the food and drinks were delicious. I had a fairly decent margarita. Our party ordered several different tacos, sides, Mac n cheese and the chorizo stuffed avocado...no complaints about any of the food! The queso is some of the best I've had and served with fresh soft chips. The burnt ends and brisket tacos were our top pics along with the mac n cheese! $5+/taco was a bit much but considering the sides are enough for at least 2 people, you could still get a meal for $10- $15/person + drinks."}
{"text":"Amazing place right from the moment you walk in. The smokey BBQ air sets up the atmosphere perfectly. All meats are very flavorful served in a taco. There is very little to prevent you from enjoying the delicious meet. The side dishes are mouth-watering too!"}
{"text":"BYOB, Cash only and delish.  The meats and tacos all had great flavors with unique preparations that made each stand on its own.  I am a sucker for Chorizo and it did not disappoint.  The Mac appetizer was tremendous although I wish we had added a type of meat to it.  The beans were a lowlight lacking flavor overall.  Biggest miss is not having a compliment to the chips for dipping as they were great. Strongly recommend a trip."}
{"text":"SMOKE is as good as it gets when it comes to taco shops. All the recipes have been created by Jeff who's from Texas by way of Meadville. He's also the daily tortilla maker - you can tell from the flour all over him when he comes out to say hi. Service by Nelda, Jeff's partner in tacos, is sweet! Each taco is an absolute delight , not like any taco you've ever had before. And don't ignore the sides. This could be the very best potato salad and cold slaw in the Burgh -sorry, Eat 'N Park! I can't wait to get back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!! Smoke is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. They definitely have the best tacos in the Burgh! They just reopened in Lawrenceville & the new place is beautiful. So much more seating available. Everything I've eaten @ Smoke has been delicious. The Queso & chips & the Mac n cheese are definite appetizers. I always order the egg & veggie tacos both with avocado cream. Amazing! This past time I went I tried the Brisket taco & it was so good! Honestly I was a little leery to try the brisket b/c I had just been to Austin TX & tried brisket for the first time (which Texas is known for their smoked brisket). However I must say Smoke did a damn good job making their brisket. Not quite as good as Texas but its still really good!! 
Service is always great, everybody is so friendly. The only downside is once you place your order it takes a long time to get your tacos. But it's totally worth the wait!
Highly recommend!!!"}

{"text":"Underwhelming.  Overpriced. And a \"girls\" bathroom doesn't scream \"woke\" enough to sustain the interest of the crowd it caters to.

Try Las Palmas.  Or Southside BBQ.  Get both?  You'd pay much less and get better hot sauce."}
{"text":"Get the chicken apple tacos and brisket Mac and cheese and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the tacos being pre-made and wrapped in tinfoil, but that said, most everything we had was very good. And well the queso, well, you can never go wrong there and theirs does not disappoint."}
{"text":"This place blew. my. mind.

Seriously, I think I'm in love. I make up reasons to come here (honey, I need shampoo so let's drive 20 minutes to go to the Waterfront - OH HEY WAIT WE'RE RIGHT NEXT TO SMOKE, lookit that!). I could literally eat every (vegetarian) item off their menu. I've considered asking if I can pay rent to live upstairs and eat there daily. I love EVERYTHING about this place!

Smoke is relatively new, so it seems their menu is ever-changing, which suits my easily-bored self quite well. My current favorites there are migas breakfast tacos, their mac & cheese (so so delicious), and their fritos con queso (yes, FRITOS as in Frito Lays - brilliant scooping action there). For beverages, they offer a few outstanding options, including MexiCoke with real sugar, agua fresca of the day, and horchatas, all very delicious. What's even better is you can customize your order quite easily, which is super accommodating since I'm such a picky eater (hey, I know what I want!). For instance, I typically add the crispy potatoes to the migas breakfast taco and take out the hot peppers. Super tasty!

The service is AWESOME. I've only ever been helped by the owner, who is super nice, helpful, and always has a smile on her face. The prices here are also pretty reasonable, considering how much I usually order (about $10-15). I also dig the minimal southwest-mod decor hardcore!

A few things of note: they are CASH only, BYOB, and MAKE THEIR OWN TORTILLAS! How hard does that rule?! (They're apparently also working on making corn ones as well for the future!)"}
{"text":"My second visit and just as impressed! The service has been awesome and they have been more than willing to accomodate me and my food allergies/restrictions even on a busy Friday night. So excited to be living right around the corner!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to smoke since it was a hole in the wall in homestead. I love the tacos and Mac n cheese. But the past two times I've gone the service hasn't been great. I've been hitting up burger Tuesdays for over a year and last time I went my waiter was an a**. He wouldn't let me make my burger the way I wanted it? Which I had been doing every other time I went. So when I said I was still going to place that order anyways he put his pen and paper away. Obvious that he wasn't happy with me. Then when he came back out with our food the order was wrong. So I didn't return for a few months. Then last night I tried again, thinking I'd be safe. Had the same waiter who told me the same thing. Then when I still ordered what I wanted he basically stopped coming to the table. Didn't offer us dessert. Just the checks. It will be awhile until I return again."}
{"text":"This may be the best food in Pittsburgh. No jive.

Floating somewhere between the street-vendor style of Reyna's and the \"fancy tacos\" of Yo Rita, Smoke manages to perfectly balance their ingredients so they meld into one singular flavor of awesome - ably claiming their rightful place as Best Tacos in the CIty.

In fact, I'm going to stop writing this so I can go back and get more tacos."}
{"text":"OK, so let me start with the good. Service was great - we were sat at a table promptly, waitress was attentive and not intrusive, kept drinks topped up without having to be called etc. The decorations and overall atmosphere of the place was great too, albeit the music was a little loud for dinner time. This part was really exceptional.

Now - the food. It was disappointing. We both ordered BBQ plates with which consisted of brisket, burnt ends, and pulled chicken, and sides of BBQ beans and Brocolini and Corn. At a place which has \"Smoke BBQ\" in the name I expected at least mediocre BBQ - but this place failed to deliver. Dry, lack of flavor, and lack of seasoning (mainly salt) all around.There was more smoke smell and flavor in the room than there was in the meats. 

I may have to return to eat some of the tacos, though only due to the great service and ambience at the place.

There is so much potential in this place, if they could just improve the food!!"}
{"text":"Great drinks and great food. The portions of the food aren't big. It's family style but you definitely could eat a whole side to yourself since they aren't that large. They do great drink and food specials on the weekdays. Burger Tuesdays are my personal favorite."}
{"text":"I'm underwhelmed.  It's good, but it's little.  I ordered a brisket salad, the most expensive food on the menu at $12, and got a salad slightly larger than a side salad.  It was tasty, but I'm still hungry right now.  The horchata is excellent.  I'm not a huge eater, but you need to be prepared to spend 20 or 25 bucks on lunch to get full.  2 tacos, one side, a drink, tax and tip....yup."}
{"text":"In town from San Francisco for the holidays, we made it out of the house exactly once- to see Les Miserables & get lunch at Smoke. Tacos were super yummy, loved the savory duck quesadilla, tangy wings and rich Mac and cheese. Service was friendly and attentive, and the space is adorable! Would totally come back!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the food and atmosphere here, but unfortunately I don't think I'll be back because this place was a total hassle to dine at.  It took us three attempts before we were able to eat here.  
The first two times the wait was too long for our schedule, which was annoying because the one time we were there during the off hour between lunch and dinner.  When we finally did eat here, they tried to seat us at this long bar but due to back issues I wasn't able to sit on that chair.  
There was a larger table empty, but the hostess told us to seat us there we'd have to be prepared for them to seat other people with us.  I could understand that, and this place is so busy bc the food is awesome but for me, it just made my overall dining experience really frustrating and so I'm not going to go out of my way to come back. It was just too frustrating.

SO, given we were on what was likely our singular visit to Smoke, I'm glad that my friend and I over estimated how much food we could eat and literally ordered every single taco they had.  You know, to try... so I could yelp! about it!

Other Yelp reviews mentioned the service would be slower and the tacos were small.  I found the service was very good, and the tacos were a normal taco size.  The thing is, they are FULL of meat.  They don't look like a lot of food but they are very, very rich and I honestly think I could be satisfied after just one taco and splitting an ap.

My favorite taco was either the BLT, or the Rib taco.  The BLT was certainly the LIGHTEST of all the tacos we tried, which was surprising.  The Rib taco was just so savory and amazing...a perflect mix of spicy, sweet, and a little kick.  I loved it.  My bf had the chicken apple bacon taco and he loved it.  I had a few bites and really liked it, but it was very rich.  I had also ordered teh Wagu taco and I took a bite and it was excellent.  

I let my bf take a bite of it and his eyes lit up the second he bit into it and he pronounced it the best thing ever.  Who am I to seperate a man from the best thing ever?  So, I pretended I was really full and let him finish it.  So all I know about that taco is that it is very, very good and that I'm pretty sure my bf dreams about it at night.

We also split the mac n cheese and it was AMAZING but as it was incredibly rich, I only had a few bites so I could walk out of Smoke without completely loathing myself/weeping for my diet.

I think the interior or the restaurant is absolutely adorable.  I would love to come back but again....its just so busy and the waits are always so long.  Maybe if they did take out (they might, I don't know) then I would def be there alll the time getting take out.  No reservations, either.  I highly recommend you try this place.  On a night where you have a lot of free time, and an elastic waist band."}
{"text":"The wait for seating and food can be a bit long but the food more than makes up for it. I usually don't order chicken as it can be a bit boring. The last time I was there I ordered the chicken taco on a whim and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. It has jumped to the top of my list of tacos."}
{"text":"Smoke is cash only which is a must die thing in the business. However their tacos are a must devour thing in the world of food. I had the special chicken bacon one and I was so gaht damn happy about it. The servers are nice and it looks pretty grand in there. Plus their mildly overpriced cookie (snickerdoodle stuffed with caramel) was really damn good. Do go"}
{"text":"Went here based on other peoples suggestjons. I went on a Wednesday night and there wasn't any wait but the food was just average. We all got different tacos but it was nothing to rave about. The veg taco was literally just beans and corn with some crunchy things and 2 people got the shrooms which they complained was too oniony. The brisket was really good and so was their queso and chips. But It was also pretty pricey. Probably wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"YUM.  I love tacos... a lot.  So when I heard about Smoke, of course, we had to make sure it was on our list of places to go to.  

I got the chicken apple taco, and BLT taco, fritos con queso, and Mexican Coke.  I was a happy camper.  I did indeed like the BLT taco better.  The tortillas there are absolutely amazing... however they make them, I would love to know (best tortillas that I have ever had).  The tacos are stuffed.  Priced appropriately in my opinion as well.  

The staff was super friendly, the food was good, the environment was very cute.  Cash only, but they have an ATM in case anyone is not aware of this.  BYOB."}
{"text":"The only thing that could improve my experience here, is if they added the Chicken and Waffle special taco that they have on occasions to the regular menu.  Every Sunday, I seem to come here in search of that amazingness and I have turned up empty far too many times recently. 

Smoke is still BYOB right now, but I think that they are getting their liquor license soon.  I love BYOB places, but whether Smoke is or is not, it would not matter to me... the food and service is great, the vibe is chill, and an overall experience is always excellent.  I love the pork taco... it seems to be the standard that I often keep turning to.  The brisket BLT, chicken, etc. are all good as well.  The tacos are served on heavenly buttermilk tortillas. Some of the best tortillas ever if you ask me!  I am also quite obsessed with their Jalapeno and Apple Slaw... soooooooo incredibly tasty and refreshing.

Smoke is definitely on my top ten list of places that I will miss when I leave Pgh... and when I return, it will be one of the few places that I cannot wait to come back to!"}
{"text":"Amazing is too much of an under statement! Be sure to try the Chips and Queso and the BBQ Brisket Taco, can;t go wrong. Service is great and atmosphere is awesome. Smells like smoked meats so unless you're vegan then its as close to Heaven as you can get. DO NOT PASS UP"}
{"text":"Amazing Mac and cheese and burritos. You have to patiently wait for a table to open up, but after you get your seat, let the feasting begin."}
{"text":"Smoke is easily the best casual restaurant in the Pittsburgh area.  

Let's get a few things out of the way.  This isn't a Mexican taco place.  The flour tortilla is only a vehicle to get the array of smoked meats into your mouth. So you SoCal kids looking for a delicate corn tortilla can quit now.  Smoke is its own genre.

Yes it is small and sometimes slow. Suck it up, good things come to those who wait. They don't take reservations but here is a tip. Go put your name in and then walk around corner to Blue Dust and have a drink. Smoke will call your cell when a table is ready. Bring cash and your own booze. They have fresh margarita mixers so half a bottle of tequila is a good addition. If booze isn't your style, try the horchata.

My favorite is the rib taco. I liken it to a McRib sandwich with great ingredients. The brisket, chicken apple, veggie and BLT are all standouts.  One of the best things on the menu is the breakfast taco. Served all day, it is great anytime and you can add a meat of your choice to it.  

One of the secrets of smoke is the wings. They are only available on Thursdays and they run out, but man oh man are they amazing. Smoked then fried, these are spicy and awesome.

If you are really lucky you will be there on a day that someone has baked. The chocolate brownie with peanut butter marscapone frosting are amazeballs!"}
{"text":"I'll start by pointing out the positives of our visit. The margaritas packed a punch and were very tasty. We started with queso as an appetizer. The homemade tortilla chips are to die for and the dip was delicious. For entrees, we had the pork tacos, chicken apple tacos, slaw, and mac n cheese. 5 stars for the chicken tacos, slaw, and mac n cheese. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. 

Now the negatives... the hostess was super pissy with us. The service was slow and scattered. We enjoyed our waiter, so perhaps the kitchen was to blame for that. The pork in the pork tacos was flavorless and incredibly dry."}
{"text":"I gave Smoke a second chance.

The first time I ever went to Smoke, I had a terrible experience.  It took over an hour for them to seat my party of 5.  And then it took another hour for them to bring our tacos out.  Any reasonable person probably would have asked to speak to management at that point (or just up and leave if you're my mother, thank God she wasn't there), but not only did I keep my mouth shut, I gave Smoke a second chance.

Unfortunately, Smoke dropped the ball again.  We were told 45 minutes to 60 minutes to seat our party of 5.  We decided to wait.  One hour and twenty minutes later, they were cleaning off a table for us.  This time the tacos were brought out at a reasonable time, thankfully.  But other small things happened - like we ordered drinks that were never brought out (but we were charged for), we were all sharing their Queso dip (which is the only reason this review has 2 stars, because it was very good) and the waitress took it before we were finished.

The staff has a \"reserved\" kindness.  I'm not sure if I don't appear hip enough to eat there or what.  People are choosing to eat at your restaurant, act excited! Greet them with enthusiasm! Thank them for coming in, etc.  The hostess barely looked up from her iPad when she \"greeted\" me and put the name in.

But, people seem to love Smoke.  So if you decide to go, I truly hope you have a better experience than mine."}
{"text":"Cozy little tacqueria on the mean streets of Homestead, Smoke is refreshing for offering awesome mexican food on a dilapidated main street in the shadow of the waterfront. Smoke is a million times better than the mega-chains across the tracks and while it's expensive for lunch does hit the sweet spot when you are craving craft-made tacos in the evenings."}
{"text":"The BEST tacos in Pittsburgh hands down. The brisket taco is probably my favorite thing on the menu! One taco is very large and pretty filling! Great drinks, fast service, and very accommodating for larger parties!! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Was I at a different restaurant. Small portions and way overpriced. You can get the same thing at taco bell"}
{"text":"I seriously can't say enough good about this place. Any review won't be sufficient so I suggest you just get your tail in gear and get in there. I'll try anyway though;) we got the horchata, Mac and cheese, broccolini and corn starter, and 3 tacos. We got the egg tacos and added chicken and brisket to each, and a pork taco. Each had such a unique flavor and something so delicious. A well done taco unlike other tacos in Pgh for sure. (I've eaten many a taco). Definitely hit these guys up on your way through. No disappointment here."}
{"text":"AMAZING. Seriously one of the best new places in the city. Cash only though, so be prepared as far as that goes."}
{"text":"\"They tricked us with their cool vibes.\" - my wife

Yes they did. The reviews are great, the atmosphere was really cool, but the food was just way too salty. I ate less than half of what I ordered, drank an entire pitcher of water, and regretted going here afterwards.

We got the queso - looked great when it came out, but the chips were over the top deep fried oily and salty.

Next we split 2 tacos (Egg Taco and the Chicken Apple Taco). The egg taco was just too much. Maybe if I was really really hungry it would have filled me up, but tonight it was just overpowering my taste buds and stomach. The Chicken Apple Taco was better, and actually probably would have been good if I already didn't feel sick from everything else.

Oh yeah I forgot to mention we split a side of Mac.  Again, just way too salty.

Also they don't have any soda products. That's kinda a bummer for me since I really do enjoy a good soda with my tacos. 

I can see how this place gets good reviews, I think maybe we just weren't in the mood for such a heavy and salty dinner."}
{"text":"My wife and I went on a Sunday afternoon. A couple of empty tables, so we got seated immediately. The waitress seemed very nice and offered some recommendations to my wife. I had the Aqua Fresca that several people raved about. It was Ok, not great. we ordered two tacos each and waited more than a half hour to get them. Not sure why since the place was certainly not packed. The tacos arrived wrapped in foil and neither myself or my wife were blown away by these tacos. In no hurry to go back. Station Street blows it away in my and my wifes' opinion. No big deal."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their Mac n cheese is amazing and so is the migas taco. They have a great ambiance and bar. My boyfriend loves their old fashioned. My only qualm is that it's always packed and hard to get a table. Wish it was bigger or they did call ahead."}
{"text":"This place is kind of a disappointment. My expectations were a little too high. I expected something better and more quality - esp since I'm paying big bucks for this small taco and sides. 

The place is small and very limited in space. It's BYOB so that's fun, for $2.50 a person - you can decide if it's worth that much. 

Tortilla seems homemade - it tasted soft with a good tortilla texture. The apricot habenero pork was delicious. The ribs - weren't so much. It tasted not as flavorful as the pork with habenero - maybe because the kick of the spice over powered the ribs. 

Mac & Cheese - it was just okay - too cheesy and a little bitter tasting. The Mac&Cheese at Cioppino's is WAY better.

Apple Salad - decent - was not bad. Just cole slaw with apples and jalepenos.

P.S. Be careful of their chairs. People seemed to fall out of them upon seating because they were so old. and fragile.

Overall - Not worth $4 a taco."}
{"text":"Best Tacos in Pittsburgh seems like wan praise.  Like...prettiest girl in the trailer park.  And I don't have a TON of experience with taco places (or trailer park girls), but I have some...and this is the best one.  

I try to avoid referencing other places relative to a place I'm rating, but suffice it to say that Smoke has competition, but as far as a more or less conventional ingredient taco goes...Smoke is it! (like Coke is it...see what I did there?)

Nice beer selection.  Very cool decor.  Great location.  Friendly servers.  Great food.  

Win."}
{"text":"I give this a 2.5/5

I will list the Cons First

#1.) Long Wait Time For Food after ordering.
#2.) Prices on the Higher Side
#3.) We went on a Tuesday which is burger night, meaning only burgers are on the menu. Limited burger and appetizer selection. 
#4.) House-Made ketchup served only, it taste like a cheap mozzarella stick marina. Quit the hipster act and at least have Heinz available as an option. 
#5.) I asked for a small side of BBQ sauce, a 1 oz portion cost me an additional $1.25.
#6.) No Reservations allowed
#7.) Cash Only and you can't split up a check. Not the Most convenient but there are plenty of ATM's around
#8.) Very Small Glasses for water - and instead of giving the table your own pitcher of water like other restaurants have implemented, you have to wait a little for refills. If you come thirsty be prepared to have at least 4 separate wait times because the glasses are small.
#9.) Like much of Lawrencville, the design is completely rustic and hipstered out. Some people like it, some people don't. Although a restaurants looks are about my last priority when rating so take it with a grain of salt.



PROS:

#1.) After all of those Cons, the one thing that truly mattered the most was phenomenal. THE FOOD. After being disappointed in the burger only menu on Tuesday I will say this: One of the best burgers I've ever had. The Meat was perfectly cooked (medium), tender, and extraordinarily juicy.  

The House Made American Cheese is unlike any other.  They load it on thick - but the fluffiness, meltyness, and overall deliciousness of the cheese make it a star.  You've got to try it, words don't do it justice.

The bacon was great, thick cut, although I'd like more than 2 pieces.

So the Burger was 10/10 on quality - so I don't mind the price too much."}
{"text":"So good news or bad news first. Let's start bad news. 

First, the lack of signage. If I hadn't read reviews on yelp before meeting friends for dinner, we might not have found this place. My friends think they are trying to fit the hipster mentality and remain anonymous. I personally hate this. A sign with their name or even the address on the door would be really helpful. Second, they are cash only. Not a big deal since they have an ATM in the back of the restaurant near the restrooms. Third, it's BYOB and we had no idea. Didn't notice this bit of information in any comments or reviews we read online. Luckily atlas bottle works is next door and offers chilled bottles and growlers to go. 

Now for the good news- the food! So good. We started with chips and queso. There was enough for four of us to share. I am a huge fan of homemade chips and these were spot on. 

We also ordered biscuits and Mac and cheese as sides. I wasn't a huge fan of the biscuits; a little to greasy for me. Now the Mac and cheese, that was a different story. Yummy! My husband didn't love it because the cheese they used was a little to sharp for his taste.

The tacos were excellent. We asked the waiter how big they were and he recommended two per person. I would say this is too much food if you are ordering sides. My rib taco was overstuffed but delicious. The chicken and Apple was also excellent but the star of the show was the brisket. 

We look forward to our next meal at smoke."}
{"text":"I think Smoke is probably fine if you are a carnivore, but as a mostly vegan vegetarian, I just can't get into it. Their regular tortillas contain buttermilk which surprised me on my first time there and I was feeling really bummed about the lack of choices...but they graciously said they had time to make some vegan ones for me right then and there! Great service! So, I was told, if you call ahead they will specially make vegan corn tortillas  - which are also gluten free - for you. But ultimately, the fillings of the veggie taco are nothing to write home about, nor worth leaving the house for (beans, pico, roasted pepper sauce); I would like to see some more vegetables in the filling and would love some avocado. Not only that, on my last visit my veg taco was served cold (my companions' food was hot, so it seemed to be a kitchen timing problemo). The space is cute, with especially good service and the food pleases most of my friends, so I am going to have to go with 3 star thingys."}
{"text":"I don't feel like I can add much more to everyone's reviews which is why I hadn't written mine until now! I guess I agree with the rest of Pittsburgh that these tacos are pretty much amazing. I got both brisket and pork and was equally obsessed with each. I also had the mac & cheese, which was good but...after reading all the reviews about how \"SOOO GOOD\" the mac & cheese was, I was a little sad that it was not the best thing I put in my mouth ever. In fact, it weirdly tastes a lot like the alfredo sauce I make from scratch. I actually kind of wished I hadn't ordered it because I couldn't finish both of my tacos after stuffing myself with cheesy noodles! The brisket taco in particular had a massive portion of meat. Which is awesome, don't get me wrong, I was just sad that I couldn't finish everything on my plate! Next time I'd probably skip the sides so I can savor the tacos.

Mentioning the beverages here is very important because I love love love horchata. I was dead set on ordering horchata until I was told that the agua fresca that day was CANTALOUPE. Cantaloupe is my favorite fruit, and I actually have been craving cantaloupe juice lately and do not own a juicer or even a blender (I know, I need to get on that). So yeah, I got the agua fresca. Worth it, but still craving horchata pretty hard. Round two will commence ASAP.

I planned to be here for a long time--maybe the entire day?--after reading all the horror stories related to the wait time. Suprisingly, service was pretty fast when we were in there with three other parties of two. Perhaps they've gotten this under control...or we got lucky."}
{"text":"After many times of coming and not being able to get seated without a 1.5 hr wait, I finally made it to smoke! The menu is simple and delivers what it advertises, BBQ inspired tacos, sandwiches, and side dishes with a fun hipster twist. I tried the famous \"queso\" as appetizer which came with delicious buttery pita chips, broccolini and corn side dish (my favorite of the night!) and two tacos (brisket and chicken.apple).
Being a Texas native it takes a lot to impress me with tacos, and I thought the ones I tried this time were OK, nothing crazy out of this world, but decently good. However, the broccolini and corn side was AMAZING and unlike anything I've ever tried before. My experience here was still great because of the fun ambienace and the great customer service.
Tips: they don't have any gluten free beer unfortunately, and they are cash only as stated probably in other reviews, so bring yo !"}
{"text":"Called at 9:40 on a Sunday night. They said they stopped seating at 10. Hours on yelp said the restaurant closes at 11. So we drove out, got there at 10 and now they are saying they close at 10 on Sunday nights."}
{"text":"This food is so delicious.  The best thing on the menu is definitely the queso.  You absolutely cannot skip it.  Prices are pretty reasonable.  Only negative is that you always have to wait a super long time to get a table."}
{"text":"Friends from Lville asked us to meet them here after the PGH marathon. I was a bit nervous at first since it said they had flour tortillas, but when I asked they told me that they could do corn ones too. I'm sure glad that they did! These are quite the gourmet taco creations. 

I had the veg and the BLT with chicken added! The BLT with chicken was my favorite of the two, but there's others that I'd love to go back and try. Unfortunately, the queso can't be made gluten free so beware of that if you are like me!

Everything I tasted had quite a kick to it. I love spice, but I know some in my party where surprised by the level of spice.

The decor is adorable, and it smells like a true smokehouse when you walk in there. The bar stools could be a bit more comfortable at some of the high tops, but it likely helps a with table turnover. I'd recommend, and will update once I try more tacos!"}
{"text":"Still Cash Only
Call ahead to make sure they're open

It's only been just over a month, and I have to update my review, since I've been here numerous times, and tried just about the whole menu - and I've felt bad about only giving 4 stars the last time because it's too good to deserve less.

 This is one of my favorite places to stop in and check up on. The drinks are always amazing - rotating agua fresca flavors with fresh lime zest, fresh squeezed lemonade - which now comes in rotating flavors! I had the raspberry lemonade today, it came topped with a generous portion of raspberry puree and the fresh tart raspberry flavor went perfectly with the sweet and sour lemonade. Rumor has it they might try blueberry tomorrow, which sounded even more interesting.

The tacos here really stand out. I know in my last review I was skeptical, but that was in their first week, and I got them to go with the sauce on the side. Now, every time I have them they're amazing. My favorites are the Mexican Migas - a breakfast taco with eggs, onions, peppers, and fried tortilla strips, the veggie with avocado creme, and the rib - whose porter BBQ sauce and the bright red smoke ring is enough to make me have dreams about returning here. Beyond that, the mac & cheese, topped with a super sharp cheddar is still out of this world.

There are now some tables for groups to eat at, but the seating is still limited so you might want to call ahead. Also, their small kitchen has been met with a great response - meaning they can, and do, sell out at times. Today they sold out of EVERYTHING before 3pm and had to close - so call ahead and make sure they're still open.

The service here is also super friendly, and sometimes if they're busy it takes them a little while (10-15minutes) to get your order, but it's always worth it. There seem to be some vague plans being tossed around: A downstairs seating area, a brewery, etc. I'm super excited to see what else Smoke has in store"}
{"text":"Cash only and byob.

Food was good, but it wasn't quite spectacular enough to justify how long we had to wait to get it. We waited an hour and a half to get seated (meh, ok, they told us to expect 45min-1hr), but after being seated and ordering, we waited an hour for our food. Fortunately my group brought some wine and was happy to chat, but some tables definitely did leave without eating in that time. Hopefully this was a fluke, since I'd definitely recommend going here another time. The queso and chickenapple taco were my personal faves."}
{"text":"We came here as a group of 9 people. You could previously use the \"No wait app\" for Smoke, but when we turned up, they told us, that this is not the case anymore. For us that was not a problem. But from that moment on, everything with Smoke turned out to be a problem for them. First, we couldn't put our names down until all 9 of us were there, which unfortunately took a while. The receptionist was quite rude and unfriendly, but my friends decided that it's worth the wait. They told us it would be about 1.5 hours, so we headed to a bar first and then came back.

After coming back, they still made us wait for about 10 min, so we started looking at the menu in order to be able to pick everything straight away once seated. In the meantime my friend walked through to the bathroom, where the receptionist ran after him trying to stop him, telling him he's not a customer and not allowed to use the bathroom? It took some discussion that we are actually waiting to be seated.

I wasn't really impressed with the tacos they serve. I had 2 vegetarian options and added meat to it (as the vegetarian option seemed to have much more flavor to it). The portions as others have said are quite small for the price you pay, and I wasn't overly blown away by the quality and taste either. It's tacos that I can prepare myself at home and they would probably turn out better. 
And in addition, the cash only is another thing that is quite annoying with Smoke.

All in all, I am definitely not rushing back as there are so many better options for dinner in Lawrenceville. And in my opinion Smoke definitely does not live up to its reviews/hype."}
{"text":"Fabulous place near The Waterfront on E 8th Ave. It smells like haven when you walk in, smoking meat and bacon. The tacos and sides are fabulous. The horchata and agua fresca are refreshing. 

The mac and cheese side dish is amazing. On Wednesdays, they have a special, varying mac and cheese. 

The potato and bacon side dish is also fabulous. 

Although it doesn't look as if I'm eating much, I'm always pretty full when I leave this place. 

It's cash only. I usually spend around $20 for a taco, side, drink with refill and tip. Great place, friendly service."}
{"text":"Food - amazing, consistent, delicious
Service - horrible. Manager and hostess (who also is a server ) were rude, impatient, and not at all focused on making guests happy. 
Beverage menu - incredibly overpriced (they serve beers in 8 oz pours) 

Because of their FOH staff, I'm reluctant to return. Will likely just order take out in the future. 

Note: they don't use no wait as its intended (reservation system). They use it to keep your name and text you but queuing system is not to be trusted. I hear you should call ahead, however they don't take reservation. Which in itself is frustrating. 

Smoke management, please focus on customer service. we go there to spend money, treat your customers with a little gratitude."}
{"text":"This is the least respectful restaurant I've ever been to. They called us an hour before our reservation and told us they wouldn't be able to seat us for an hour later than our reservation. We were already in the area and had friends in from 4 hours out of town. We finally got sat an hour later than our reservation. Apparently they didn't like us and decided not to serve us so we had to leave. They were really just waiting for us to leave so that they could seat their friends who walked in waiting for a table last minute. To top it all off, when we tried to voice our opinion to the manager, he had to hold back from laughing in our face (along with the other employees). It must be nice for business to be so well that they can pick and choose their clients. Not to mention there were ten of us. Extremely disappointed in what this place has to offer."}
{"text":"Awesome food, run don't walk. Generous portions, only downside was that dessert was crazy expensive.  Maybe they could let you known in advance that the \"Pie\" is small and perfect for 2 people to share, but they will be charging you $12."}
{"text":"Rude, nasty, mediocre food... Chicken taco said Fresno sauce, sounded fresh and cool like Fresno California. Nope!! Super spicy! Couldn't eat it :("}
{"text":"Delicious and simple. This is a great spot to hit up if you want to grab a quick drink and some food. Staff is very friendly and the tacos are delicious. They have a nice selection on the menu. And $5 Margs!  Can't beat that!!!"}
{"text":"This place was suggested by a friend as a small group of us was spending the night out and about in Lawrenceville.  It was a Thursday evening and there was no wait when we came in at 6...though it's small and did quickly fill up.  The service was...sufficient.  Not the friendliest, but not necessarily rude.  Attentive in terms of refills and whatnot, but just not the warmest or most welcoming.

We all thought the food was excellent.  With the influx of taco restaurants in Pittsburgh any more, I was skeptical of $7 for a taco.  That being said, the taco was YUUUGE!  I'm a big eater, and the two tacos I got more than filled me up.  Stuffed with lots of delicious smoked meats.  I would have been more than satisfied with one taco and a side of beans or a veg.  The only thing I sampled (and we all sampled quite a bit from each other) that I wouldn't order again was the burnt ends taco.  I typically like burnt ends, but the combination of that plus the barbecue sauce, which I believe was coffee based or accented, was just too much of an overwhelmingly smokey flavor.  Cocktails were on par for most decent restaurants anymore.

Be aware that it is cash only, and the entire restaurant smells like smoke (duh).  I'm pretty sure my dogs thought that a beef brisket walked in the door when I got home.  Also, I was prepared with layers of clothes because most restaurants have the a/c cranked up and I'm wimpy when it comes to that.  However, I don't think they have a/c, because it was super-warm in there.  I prefer it that way, but just tossing that out there.  Probably give this 3 1/2 stars, but I decided to round up based on the fact that I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. The environment is very trendy and nice. It was a good place to dine with my daughter (age 3). The food is a little pricey and because it was freezing cold outside it had quite a cold draft blowing through, causing my family to have to keep their coats on. 

I will likely eat here again. I recommend the brisket tacos and pork tacos. The mac and cheese and coleslaw are both good."}
{"text":"Great find thanks to Yelp. It is our go to place before a show at the Improv. 

Great atmosphere and even better food. Tacos are not that big so most people would need at least two. They have some good sides and salads as well."}
{"text":"SUPERB.. Insanely delicious food. Staff very helpful and well informed. It's BYOB which is also super cool. Cool setup and atmosphere. Good date spot or even casual dinner.

The food is really the highlight here tho. There isn't anything that's not made from scratch and top quality. Get there early if u want a table..

Its a must try, you'll probly see me there again when you do."}
{"text":"This place is basically dressed up fast food. A such, the food is decently tasty but not refined in any way. (By the way, barbecue and tacos can be refined. It's just that this place isn't.) This place is also slightly overpriced for the quality of the food; if it was a tad more refined, the prices would make more sense. 

The only aspect that is quite dissimilar from a typical fast food joint is the speed of service. We didn't have any trouble getting seated like other reviewers. But, I can understand why people arriving later on would have to wait. The kitchen is not efficient enough to turn around tables quickly. Overall, it was worth trying out once, but not worth returning to."}
{"text":"This place deserves ten stars. I loved Every. Single. Thing. I'm gonna tell you how to do this. First. You must have queso and chips. The homemade tortilla chips are crunchy and pillowy soft at the same time. Pair it with a spicy margarita. Next. Order a taco. Any taco. They are all amazing. Pair the taco with potato salad. I know. It sounds weird but you will thank me. Last. Polish it all off with homemade icecream.  
The service is prompt and friendly. Cool decor. 
This is my new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Smoke has the best homemade tortilla chips ever! I recommend them to everyone!  This is a great spot for a small group of people to grab delicious cocktails and great food. I've tried all of the tacos and the mac and cheese, would recommend all.  My favorite thing to get here is the queso, add pork with chips. 

I wouldn't recommend Smoke for big groups as they dont take reservations and its hard to get seated with a large group on a busy night. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I thought I left a review years ago when they were relatively new because my husband and I were very impressed by their food. We loved it.
Then we went back last night. They got rid of their Frito Pies and also their chili. Ok, no problem. 
My husband ordered a pork and ribs tacos, I ordered two veggie tacos. Let me explain something: their veggie tacos were so delicious the first two times we went there years ago, full of flavor, full of ingredients, potatoes, peppers, corn, beans, onions, tomatoes, I can't even remember what else they had. Yesterday I received two veggie tacos filled with beans and corn and sauce. I was so disappointed. The size of my tacos were a lot smaller (the price stayed the same $3) I was not satisfied with the food, nor was my husband. 
We also ordered Queso, which is a bowl of fritos and another bowl of liquid cheese with some diced tomatoes, new in their menu and very messy. 
BYOB is $2.50 per person.
They added more tables and now they also have waitresses. For a Saturday night this place wasn't busy at all. 
This is sad, we thought this was the best place in Pgh to get tacos.

By the way, this is not Mexican food. The owner is from Texas so this is tex-mex, don't expect authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"I have been here three times and every time the food has been superb. The rib, chicken, and fried chicken (On special) tacos were all amazing. Although a single taco is expensive, it is filling and delightful. However my two favorite things are not the tacos themselves. First favorite is the queso. It is quite delicious by itself but the chips that come with it are hands down my favorite chips at any restaurant. They seem to be some sort of flour based chip instead of corn and boy o boy are they delightful. Beware, this serving is very large so I would recommend sharing with at least two people if you want to have any hope of finishing your tacos. Also the corn/broccoli side dish us AMAZING. whatever crumbly goodness they put on top should be illegal but I'm glad that it isn't. One star off because we've had bad service here and I liked it better as Byob (especially when atlas bottle works is right next door). Overall definitely a place to check out if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Wow, this place was great!  We went on a Tuesday which, unbeknownst to us, was Burger night.  That meant a special menu of just burgers and a few select appetizers and sides.  At first I balked because I really wanted tacos and a margarita, but the charming hostess convinced me to stay.  She raved about the place and how everything was made from scratch - from the ketchup to the buns and even the cheese!!!  Plus the drink of the day was $5 hibiscus mojitos.  I couldn't pass it up, burgers it was.  Drinks were delivered promptly and they were fabulous - the tastiest cocktail, let alone mojito, I have had in a while.  I ordered the classic burger with cheese which came with fries.  Really rich, flavorful, and cooked perfectly.  The brioche bun made from scratch has probably spoiled me forever.  Fries were shoestring style - perfectly crisped and seasoned and the ketchup was not like your standard Heinz, but a rich tomatoey goodness with a really nice flavor.  I was impressed that it was all done from scratch and I ate every last morsel.  I'll be back to try the the tacos for sure, but if someone wants to know where to get a great burger on a Tuesday - I'll certainly recommend Smoke."}
{"text":"Had lunch at this establishment today.  4 tacos and a rice water drink = $42.00.  I can read the prices on the menu so the pricing didn't bother me, it's what I got for the $42.00. We received, 4 tacos of which 2 were brisket, 1 was pork and the last one was egg. We all know the barbecue is already cooked and one can scramble some eggs in about 2 mins.  With this knowledge I wondering how it can take 25 mins to make 4 tacos.  I live in San Antonio where you can get great tacos everywhere in a matter of a few mins.  

While waiting for our tacos I'm thinking these should be awesome since they are taking so long and there are only 9 people in the restaurant.  You can guess how surprised I was when our tacos arrived wrapped in foil, just like Taco Cabana does in Texas, and opened my pork to find they didn't put the sauce on that I asked for and when I asked the waitress about it I got a \"deer in the headlights\" look and a rude comment.  When I got to the brisket taco it was packed with Serrano peppers and was so damn hot you couldn't taste the meat. My wife had a brisket taco also and hers was completely different from mine. 

So in a quick review, 4 tacos of which at least 2 were wrong, a rude waitress, and a ticket time that a fine dining restaurant wouldn't want.  Save your time and money, go else were.  On a positive note they have a great smoker."}
{"text":"Great food, simple menu. Try the mac & cheese with bacon.
I hear that they're moving from Homestead to Lawrenceville. This is very sad. Homestead needed them. Lawrenceville does not need them; Lawrenceville has enough good restaurants already."}
{"text":"The queso and chips will knock your socks off. The fried flour tortillas (made in house) are a unique take on nachos and come fresh out of the frier. Tacos are probably the best i've had in Pittsburgh, are substantial in size and easy on the wallet. We had the rib taco and chorizo - great smoke and spice. Two tacos was enough for the two of us. We also had the mac'n'cheese as a side which was great. Warm service at the bar and a great beer list too. So happy to find a place like Smoke that is really paying close attention to detail."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in this place. The name of the establishment sounds like its going to be good but it really isnt. I only tried the Chicken apple taco and sadly its only 1 taco wrapped in foil and its tiny for like $7. I thought i was getting a nicely sized taco. You would have to buy 3 of them to get full. The taco was not really memorable.  This place does not even have burritos.  Better to go to chipotle and get something that will fill you up for $10.  Everything just seems overpriced. Oh yeah they have an atm but its in the back really awkwardly placed."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first visit. The hostess, Nelda, was accommodating and informative when I had questions. I was hoping to have tacos and discovered that Tuesdays are burger day. Nelda did a good job of up selling me to the Deluxe Burger instead of getting the regular burger. I enjoyed the Bourbon Cherry Cola with house made cola and luxardo cherries. Pickles were crisp and fresh. Everything was good"}
{"text":"Tough to give a 1-5 star rating of this place. Lots of pros and cons. I suppose it depends what you want in a restaurant... For me, more cons than pros.

Pros: burnt ends and brisket were excellent.   BBQ beans (for me) and mac were pretty good.

Cons: not cheap for what it was. Really loud. Won't be back with my family again because my mom and in-laws spent the entire time (literally) yelling at each other/leaning across the table to hear. Maybe that's on us for going at 6pm? 

Not much seating. 

My mom didn't enjoy the beans because they were much too spicy... And We don't remember them being labeled as such. Too bad, she ordered them as her entree.

What started me off on the wrong foot was our waitress. She seemed like she was phoning it in. In a place that loud, you really should learn to project with your voice. If older folks are asking you to repeat yourself, raise your voice when you reply, don't just simply restate at your original volume. I had to repeat the specials to my table. I'm 32, and they're mostly mid 60s. Then I asked what the house BBQ sauce was,  and she told me that it was a \"traditional BBQ sauce.\" Does that mean vinegar base or tomato base? Memphis or Carolina? Spicy? Anything would help. I asked for a clarification and didn't get any help... So I figured that she either didn't know what was in it or hasn't had enough BBQ anywhere else to know the difference. I chose the coffee sauce. Across the able we had 3 different selections, none of which really thrilled anyone. The burnt ends were great, but were not enhanced by any of the  lightly flavored/thin sauces.

Brisket portions were small.

Odd experience. I guess if you're a real BBQ fan, stick to your hole in the wall/smoke truck restaurants. They'll be cheaper and more suiting to your tastes I would bet.

If you want a pricier, trendy restaurant experience, perhaps this is the place for you. 

We left as soon as the bill came to get coffee where we could hear each other. I won't be back, there's better BBQ to be had at cheaper prices."}
{"text":"We came in for a friend's birthday and we were seated promptly ( we had reservations ). I've hear a lot about this place so I was eager to try it. 

Our waiter was really nice and patient. We had a rather large party and two people were running late. Not once did our waiter loose patience with us. He was very up beat and nice even when asked to take a photo of a group of 8 girls while he was busy. He kindly took our pictures and had fun with it. 

The ambience is very trendy, very fun. It was a type of rustic hipster, if you will. It's byob, but there is a 6 pack store right next door.

Unfortunately, to me, the food was just okay. I got the ribs taco, which was good, but nothing really special, just rib meat, onions, and cilantro in a soft taco shell. I also got the chicken apple taco. It was supposed to have apple, bacon, cheese,and a jalapeño mayo in it. I'm a huge fan of sweet and savory / sweet and spivey, but the spiciness overpowered the whole taco. (I can tolerate a pretty high level of spiciness but this was a little much) I could only taste chicken and mayo. The apple coleslaw was good, but again, not mind blowing, just a regular vinegar based coleslaw with apple in it. I did try my friend's chorizo macaroni and cheese; THAT, was fantastic. I would say best thing on the menu. The chorizo was well done, great flavor and paired with that Mac n cheese...absolutely phenomenal. 

I read in a few reviews and was told the service was slow. I actually feel like for a small, locally ran restaurant they were fairly decent. Yes, it took a little longer than your average chain, but they have a very small kitchen, try to give you a higher end experience with their food, and have take out orders. Therefore, I think the service was fine and nothing out of the ordinary. 

As far as pricing goes, it's a little on the higher end for what you get. I don't mind paying more for a great food experience; however, I definitely didn't think my chicken taco was worth what I paid for it (6.00).  The chorizo Mac n cheese was worth what we paid though. Although, I do understand given the neighborhood they are housed in. 

It was my first visit there so I'm definitely not opposed to going again and trying something else. Perhaps, it may even sway my yelp rating for this restaurant. I really enjoy the vibe.  It seems like a good spot to hang out and get some small bites throughout the night.   

Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Love Smoke, Celebrated with my gf our first date, (one year later).  Just as good as I remember, the other thing was that the prices went up, one of the tacos went up $2.25.  The Queso is just about the best thing ive ever eaten.  The same with the chorizo mac n cheese.  BYOB and Cash Only.  If you are in the area of the waterfront, please make sure you stop by."}
{"text":"With their vibrant crowd and lovely environment I anticipated such a wonderful experience from service to food to libations. The food, drinks, and our waitress was great, but don't let that fool you. The hostesses had a poor attitude throughout the evening, along with management allowing waiting customers to bager customers that were already seated. I was appalled by the actions of waiting customers and the demeanor of management allowing such inappropriate behavior in their establishment. They were borderline instigating an altercation. It was something I've never seen before in my 17 years restaurant experience."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was here. Finding the place was a bit of a challenge, I walked past it twice. There is no sign out front. It is right beside the Cinema. Chips and cheese were so good, chips are made fresh and cheese dip is very tasty. Mac and cheese is good, it can easily be shared by two or even three as a side. Brisket taco was delicious and we had a special taco of the day, just a little on the spicy side but not too much. Flavored drinks like cantaloupe etc very good. BYOB so if you want alcohol there is a take out beer store next door. I was not disappointed at all and will definitely return. One very small criticism was they served room temp water before the meal and we were there on a hot humid day, ice water would have been appreciated."}
{"text":"Hands down Smoke is my favorite spot in Lawrenceville. I tried their taco special on Monday and it tasted absolutely amazing. I also tried their cheeseburger on burger night with vinegar soaked fries and my whole meal was on point. (I wanted to get a second round of burgers but I opted out last minute when I considered the calories) 

Definitely a must try!!"}
{"text":"A Gem!

Smoke is one of those places I would have never, ever found or had the pleasure of trying if it weren't for a friend's suggestion. Unless you are looking for it, you're likely to pass it by as it is tucked into a strip of shops in Homestead. This place is just plain different, and it's oh so refreshing. The restaurant is small and intimate, yet relaxed and extremely laid back. You'll notice that everything is fresh made, and as the small menu explains, tortillas are never over a day old.

After taking a seat at the small bar and looking over the menu, I ordered a Chicken Apple taco and  a Pork taco, as well as a Queso appetizer. To drink, I got a fresh squeezed lemonade--which I can say may just be the best lemonade I ever had.

The tacos arrived simply wrapped in foil. Unwrapping them revealed a thick, fresh, soft tortilla shell filled with the taco ordered. The chicken apple taco came with bacon and a semi-spicy jalepeno ranch sauce-- fantastic. The pork taco was spicier and was my favorite of the two. But, trying to chose which taco is a favorite is like picking your favorite child. They were both top notch.

Another quirk of Smoke is that they only accept cash, which is cool by me and adds to the intimate experience. Have no fear though, there is an ATM on-site.

In conclusion, I couldn't recommend Smoke more. It will become a mainstay on my dining plan whenever I am in town and I'll encourage friends, family and strangers alike to check it out!"}
{"text":"Good taco but the Mac and cheese is very thick and caked in butter, was not impressed. Also the queso had the same consistency as soup, go to Moe's for better (and cheaper)."}
{"text":"The food was very average. I was expecting a lot more. The atmosphere was cool but our service was terrible so it ruined our overall experience."}
{"text":"Smoke is the bomb. They get 5 stars for being awesome every time I've gone. 

Back when they were in Homestead and BYOB to being in Hipsterville with a liquor license, they've stayed true to their original vibe. 

Super awesome smoked meat with absolutely amazing sides. Cannot go wrong here. I promise. 

PS The salads are amazing too (get one with brisket)!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Smoke even after hearing so much about it when it was back in Homestead. 

We started with the queso and chips. You can tell they make their own chips because they were a bit chewy opposed to churchy. They weren't bad, just different. Kind of pita like. I also had the brisket taco which was good but small and shared the Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was delicious and extra creamy. My favorite thing  was my drink though! I got the Agua Fresca and it was so refreshing!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos and wings. Fair Pricing. You can't go wrong here!

My only issue was cash only. It's 2013. Who carries cash?"}
{"text":"Smoke, in a nutshell is a hipster taco joint. It's delicious and if you are going to be hungry in the next 90 minutes, have some cash to burn and nothing to do in the next 2.5 hours, you should absolutely eat here. Everything I had was very enjoyable and I would definitely go back. I'm only giving it four stars because I feel like for what the place is, the service should be a bit faster considering most of the food is almost completely cooked beforehand and everything is pretty pricey (Cost a bit more than $60 for two people if you go all out).

Now for the details and helpful stuff: If you put your name down, they'll text you when your table is ready and since they don't serve drinks (though they allow you to BYOB), you can easily go to a neighboring bar while you wait for your table. They also have a fridge near the front door so you can keep your beer or other adult beverages cold while you wait/during your meal. And it's cash only but there are at least 3 ATM's within a block and they have one inside. The one at Commonwealth bank has a $3.50 fee. Note that though this is a casual restaurant, they serve you like you're eating at an upscale place--slow. So don't be afraid to order a lot because they'll make you pace yourself with the time between courses.

Now for the food: I was lucky enough to dine with some foodie friends and while I didn't take a bite of everyone's tacos, we did share flour tortilla chips, smoked salsa (this was a daily special), queso, the apple slaw, smoked cabbage, mac and cheese w/ brisket, and a berry pie topped with marscapone and cream cheese. I ate a chicken and a pork taco and had a bit of the brisket special taco (blue cheese sauce, tomatoes, other stuff). 

Out of all of these things, the smoked salsa, chips and queso and the chicken taco were my favorites. The smoked salsa should be a regular menu item. It had a great blend of tomatoes, onions and peppers, left a strong smoke flavor in my mouth and left me feeling very excited to eat more smokey things. The chips paired with it very well. They are fried to order which makes them extra awesome, though that means you pay about $6 for them and you wait a bit. So be patient, they are worth it! We topped our queso w/ their house-made chorizo, which was also fantastic. Though it's more of a very good cheese dip versus queso. There are peppers in there but they don't add a lot of spice and no smoke comes through in the dish at all but whatever, this hipster cheese dip is a must-order. 

I really liked both of my tacos and it's obvious that Smoke tries hard to build a great and well-thought out flavor profile in each and every taco. I enjoyed the chicken taco a bit more because it had the right ratio of meat to condiments/other dressings. The pork taco had a lot of pulled pork on it and while the pork was flavorful, I felt like I was eating a pulled pork sandwich but with a tortilla. The brisket special was good but had too much going on for my palate and it was super greasy. 

The mac and cheese was good but I'm not sure if it was worth the $8 + $3 add on for the brisket. I enjoyed the brisket part of the mac and cheese the most (I'm totally getting a brisket taco next time), though the grease from the brisket didn't drip down and flavor the mac and cheese like I was hoping it'd do. I'm just not sure I would vote this my favorite restaurant mac and cheese, though it was good. The smoke cabbage was awesome! The smoke flavor wasn't too overwhelming and it had chunks of bacon or pancetta in it that really added to it. The apple/cabbage slaw was pretty refreshing and light compared to everything else we got though I think I should have added some salt to it. I would get this again.

The pie was pretty amazing. It was an open pie (no crust on top) with some heavenly mix of berries in it. It's a pretty healthy size so I'm glad we split it between 6 people. It's also $11 and if you order coffee, that's a $15 dessert. But I had nothing better to do and some money to burn, so it was all so worth it!

Finally, before I forget, they have fun flavored lemonades that could be elevated by booze. I'd recommend buying some airplane shots or just bringing a flask of gin, tequila or vodka with you. You can also purchase a pitcher of margarita mix for $15. Also, I heard that sometimes they have an 'ultimate taco' of the day which I believe are inspired by one of their line/prep cooks named Jesse. It's rumored that he's a great cook, totally fit and single."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews, we went.Early. the place only seats about 10 so if you go late, wait. Second hand store retro mishmash of furnishings. The food is good, unique flavors typical boutique portions=small. Not a street taco by any stretch for the price.But different combinations and handmade drinks. Excellent reading material while you wait. Overall it is OK but not southwest great."}
{"text":"I can't stop eating this place.

The BBQ is amazing - from chicken to brisket to ribs to pork.  It all melts in your mouth.  And the combination of flavors that are being assembled in each taco... to die for.

This is the new \"I'm going to impress Pittsburgh visitors with a trendy local place that has out of this world food\" location.

OK, ok - so there aren't a lot of chairs.  And I hear that some folks have experienced super-long wait time.  Whatever... this food is worth it.  Plus, I just go between 2pm and 5pm and there's never a problem (longest I've waited is about 15 minutes).

Here's how to do it right: assemble your crew at Smoke (between 2 and 5 people, I would recommend) and designate representatives to hold the fort/wait for a table and designate others to walk two blocks to the bar and get beers.  I recommend the bar that is just on the Homestead side of the train tracks (across from the Waterfront).  They have a great selection.

Drink said beers while waiting then you won't be all grouchy about it.

When ordering: GET EVERYTHING and SHARE.  Get the Frito Pie.  Get the jalepeno apple slaw.  Get the mac and cheese.  Get the beans.  DO IT.  Plus, get about 2 tacos per person.  You will be stuffed to the gills, but you will be happy.  (Note my motto: living the gluttonous life)

For spice lovers, get the brisket.  Fresh jalepeno slices and melt-in-your-mouth brisket.  (In your best Homer Simpson voice: mmmm.... brisket).

For a more mild flavor experience, get the chicken and apple.  They cure their own bacon for crying out loud and it's all in there!

I could go on... but I won't.  Just get your butt there!

And pick me up a taco while you're at it."}
{"text":"¡El mejor secreto guardado en la ciudad!  ¡Maravillosa comida!  La gente es muy simpática, y el servicio es excelente.  El restaurante no es elegante y no hay asientos limitados.

{"text":"Great tacos and queso, atmosphere is cute, but the wait is intolerable and the staff is unfriendly, which took away from the experience."}
{"text":"I am surprised this place is only 3 1/2 stars, I thought it was delicious!  I came here on a friend's recommendation, he told me not to be fooled by the 3 1/2 stars haha.

I went for the pulled pork taco with slaw and the mac and cheese with burnt ends.  I thought the taco was very good, on a homemade tortilla and tender pork with a sweet bbq sauce.  I would recommend getting the slaw on it as it is a nice crunch and a nice saltiness to the sweet bbq sauce.  The mac and cheese is heavy and don't think I would have liked it if I did not add meat.  The burnt ends was super good and I loved the crunchiness on top of the mac and cheese.  It was a pretty big portion and definitely not just a side dish."}
{"text":"Impossible to find. Snooty hipster waitstaff. Cash only and a $4 fee arm. I don't care how good your food is."}
{"text":"I've been a Smoke devotee for quite awhile. We used to hit up their Homestead location on the regular. Smoke has changed quite a bit trough the years, but certain things remain consistent enough to keep me coming back. 

The original Homestead location's menu was quite limited compared to these days - it was basically tacos, mac and cheese, and a couple other items. Always BYOB. They remained BYOB in Lawrenceville for awhile. And I really, really miss that aspect. You used to be able to stroll in, pop your six pack in the old fridge there, and settle in for awhile. Given the byob aspect, you didn't mind paying 6-8 dollars for a taco, because you could still get out of there for less than 50 bucks. Those days are long gone now. Their alcohol is way overpriced, and if you want a few drinks with your meal, a couple out for lunch is in for $80, $90, even $100+. For tacos and a few glasses of wine. It's a pain. Oh, and they're STILL cash only. Not sure how they get away with that.

I have to address the slowness complaints in other reviews. For years, Smoke was slower than molasses. And that was okay by me. I kind of subscribe to the French philosophy of restaurant service - most of the time, I'm there to slowly drink, chat, and stretch the meal out over the course of a couple hours. I don't want the waiter stopping by every 5 minutes to ask if I need anything. Smoke reminded me of that style of service. That was always true, until the last year or so. Some process in the kitchen has changed and the food basically comes right out now. I haven't had to wait more than 15-25 minutes in quite awhile, busy or slow. So, speed of service is really no longer an issue.

Okay. The food. My disclaimer is I basically only get tacos at smoke. Sometimes we'll grab a side, but I find that the sides only serve to take up much needed taco real estate in my stomach. That said, the sides are generally good to great. The mac and cheese is killer.

I know they have ribs now, and Tuesdays are burger nights (exclusively). Which sucks, quite frankly. I'm not coming to a place called Smoke Taqueria for a burger. I'm coming for the smoked... taqos.

Anyway. All of the tacos are generally outstanding, my favorites being Chicken Apple and Brisket. If you go to smoke enough, you'll find that they're pretty inconsistent in terms of taco flavor, texture, and heat. Homestead Smoke used to absolutely bring the heat. I remember trying to get through some of those tacos - it was was like some form of exquisite torture. Pouring sweat, pounding beer, and begging for sweet mercy. 

For the most part, they've dialed back the heat. But sometimes you'll still get one that will rip your face off. It's a coin-flip, really. There are similar inconsistencies with the ratio of ingredients on any of the signature tacos. It's all good though - it's part of what keeps me coming back. Always something slightly different than last time. 

So this review probably hasn't helped you in any way. And for that, I am sorry. My suggestion would be to go down to Smoke, get some tacos, break out the wallet and pay (cash) for some over-priced craft beer, and have yourself a day. Odds are you'll like it."}
{"text":"First, the wait was close to two hours. Second, when the food came a member in our party did not receive their side, after they asked about it, it came once their food had already been eaten.  Third, brisket taco was dry.  Fourth, nothing was extra special. Fifth, there was no ice in our drinks and when I asked for ice I did not receive it.  
Our waitress was nice and when we complained she did take money off the bill.  But still I would much rather walk in with no wait to Doce on the South Side, sit at the bar and get a 3$ awesome taco than this overpriced, nothing special food.  Over rated."}
{"text":"Food is amazing but the turn around for pick up orders sucks. There is no reason why you can pull pork out of the vat that it's simmering in and slap together some tacos a bit faster than 90 minutes for take away."}
{"text":"A friend and I are on a quest to try all Pgh Magazine's top 25 restaurants, so we met today at Smoke for lunch. First, make sure you google map it because the restaurant is not well marked but for a small sign on the door. Inside, you'll find a trendy little restaurant with an appetizing smokey smell, but plan on smelling it on you for the rest of the day. We both had sandwiches - the brisket with potato salad and the black bean burger with Mac and cheese. We agreed they were good but nothing to \"write home to mother\" about - probably not a place I'd make a point to trek back to Lawrenceville to visit."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Friday evening with my fiance and 5 other dining companions.  We had tried to set up reservations a few weeks in advance but were told to call that night for a type of call ahead seating.  They quoted us about 45 minutes to an hour over the phone and we arrived about a 30 minutes after that.  As soon as we entered the restaurant and saw people with a cooler, I realized that it was BYOB.  Conveniently there is a liquor store about a block away and while I went over there to get a bottle of wine, the rest of my party arrived and were also seated.  There isn't too much to say about the inside of the place as it is done in earthy colors with about 6 tables or so, a bar with the cash register on it and also a set off stairs which seem to be from the days whenever it was probably a house.  One thing to note is that while they have air conditioning inside, I can't say that it was terribly effective on the balmy night that we were there.  While one side of the table had some very cold legs, that was not my side and my back was soaked with sweat by the time that the meal ended.

For dinner I decided that I should sample a little bit of a lot of things and so I ordered 3 tacos (rib, chicken and wagyu brisket),  mac n cheese with brisket on top and also ordered one of their homemade hot sauces.  One of our dining companions ordered the queso and chips which came out first and tasted pretty great.  The tortilla chips were clearly homemade and had a nice crisp to them and tasted great dipped into the queso.  I was thankful for those chips as our tacos and other food took a decent amount of time to come out.  My tacos were pretty good with the chicken being my favorite.  It came with pickled onions, avocado and a hot sauce that gave it the perfect tang.  It made me wish that the hot sauce I had ordered was delivered but sadly that was not to be and I never bothered the waitress to end up getting it.  The rib taco was my second favorite with the porter barbeque sauce helping to carry the flavor while the ribs were tender.  Finally my least favorite of the overall enjoyable tacos was the wagyu brisket which came with onions, hot peppers and mustard sauce.  The mac and cheese that I had ordered was good too, especially whenever I got pieces of the brisket with it, otherwise it was a bit bland for my tastes.

The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be heading back here in the future.  The only drawbacks to the place in my opinion are that it is cash only and has limited seating but that is far outweighed by the positives of friendliness of the staff, it being BYOB with a $3.50 corkage fee and most importantly some awesome food."}
{"text":"The food says it all...it makes up for close seating (sitting next to your neighbor), cash only, BYOB, and so-so service. The place is very hip/trendy, but in an annoying way. Staff just don't seem as welcoming, genuine as some other nice places in the city..service was good though.

The food makes up for all of it though....seriously amazing. BEST MAC-n-CHEESE I have every had in my life, hands down...can actually taste the smoked cheese and I don't know how to describe it other than you MUST try it...the absolute best I've had. The tacos were so good too, the meat is amazing smoked, tender, flavorful, soooo good!! 

They had some type of jalapeno lemonade that was great, super hot and lightly sweet, a must...pour some tequila in it for an added bonus. The house made marg-mix pitcher was really fresh and great, I poured a little bottle of Patron in it and suddenly didn't care about the atmosphere so much. You will GET LOST in this food, TRY IT!

One annoying thing: No reservations, only call ahead seating, but you can only call up to an hour before you come...and you can't find them on \"No Wait\" app, but that is the app they put your call ahead seat on..you have to call for some reason."}
{"text":"My biggest problem with this place is the word \"Taqueria\" in the name.  If you don't serve tortilla chips made of corn, it isn't a taqueria.  What you have is a place selling hipster food that does taste good, but certainly doesn't have much of a right to claim the hispanic/mexican cred contained in the word taqueria.  They played foreigner, Journey and Boston over the PA, and I'm certain nobody in the place- owner, server, chef or customer- spoke any Spanish at all. Which is fine- but don't call it a taqueria.  Call it a \"nouveau taco joint\" or something like that."}
{"text":"The waitress was rude, and they only accept cash payments. We ordered a bowl of queso and chips and salsa, and they didn't provide enough chips for us to even eat 25% of the queso. They charged us for a chip refill. We waited an hour and a half for our tacos. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME COMING HERE!"}
{"text":"This place is such a gem. Watch out, though! If you blink, you'll miss it.

Nestled right next to Row House Cinema on Butler Street in Larryville, Smoke boasts no sign, or any promotional items outside alerting you to the glorious things happening inside. But as soon as you open the door, BAM! You know where you're at! 

I called ahead for reservations, but they didn't accept them. You can call 30 minutes before you're arrival, just to get your name \"on the list\". I did just that, and after the short ride from the North Side (minus the traffic on 28), my adventurous friend, Jess  and I were sat immediately at the bar. We both ordered lemonade, and it was gone before we knew it! So refreshing, simple and cold. It was topped with zest, and I saw them juicing lemons into our glasses when they refilled them. Next time we'll remember that they're a BYOB, and bring some beer! But I'll still get a lemonade. 

We went over the single page menu for a good amount of time, with help from the bartender. He made good suggestions, but didn't let us know about the Scorpion Wings, that were the special that day. (The only reason I'm giving a 4 and not a 5-star review) He told the guys next to us after we had already started eating, and I would have LOVED to try them. They smelled and looked amazing. 

We wound up ordering the Big Bowl 'O Cheese, with fresh tortilla chips (that I couldn't stop eating), a Brisket Taco, a Applebacon Taco, and a side of Mac & Cheese.  I wanted to eat everything, and then eat the plate it came on. The cheese was on point, the chips were crispy, and the tacos....ooohhhh the tacos. The Brisket was tender, and the mustard on it was a perfect pair. I was slightly jealous of Jess's decision to get the Applebacon taco. But she was nice enough to share! :) It was a little on the spicy side, but the crispy apples toned the kick down nicely. The Mac & Cheese was a last minute decision as a side, and I was so happy we added it on. Creamy, with cheddar and mascarpone cheeses, it melted in your mouth. 

Thank goodness they have boxes, because I took so much home. Jess and I escaped with a bill just under $35, but remember, they only accept CASH! but there's a PNC and a Citizen's ATM's bank right next door. 

All in all, GO HERE. Just make sure you plan ahead and give them a call! :) 

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Other reviewers have mentioned that Smoke is inconspicuously situated on Butler Street and they are correct.  I'm not sure the name is even on the door- but it's worth finding!

The atmosphere here is Lawrencville trendy- you know what I mean - exposed brick walls, dim lighting, and contemporary art.  But it works and it sets the stage for a nice meal.  

Fairly simple menu with several types of tacos.  I got the BLT taco with a nice and spicy jalapeño mayo that had a great kick.  I also ordered the Mac and it was very tasty and rich- I took half home and was equally full both sittings.  

The service is good here.  I find it amusing that the restaurant has a large bar, but it's BYOB.  I'm assuming they have a lot of mixers.  I saw several lemonade and non-alcoholic options.  There's also a mini fridge you can put your beer in to keep cool.  

I plan on being a repeat costumer."}
{"text":"I like the decor, I like the food (yes, it's good and not too cheap nor expensive, and the flavor is refined), I don't like that you cannot do take-out and no delivery."}
{"text":"I never had the pleasure of dining at Smoke while they were located in Homestead but finally stopped by their new(er) Lawrenceville location in August to pick up some tacos to-go for my husband's birthday.

My quick glance at the decor and brief interaction with an employee were all very positive. I had selected four tacos (the Pork, Chorizo, Chicken Apple, and Brisket, I think?) plus a side of queso and chips. I was a bit surprised when I was told the total - nearly $35, I believe - as I was expecting four tacos and a side to cost in the $25 range.

Unfortunately, my husband arrived home later than I had expected, so I didn't get to try any of the tacos as hot or as fresh as I had hoped. I kept the foil wrappers tightly closed, and we dug in as soon as he came home. Smoke delivers big flavors in little bites, and I can definitely understand their popularity. However, I actually felt that they delivered too much flavor at times, to the point where it felt like a spicy, muddled mess in my mouth. I am a huge fan of queso and was excited to try theirs. The base white cheese was smooth and creamy and delicious, but I was disappointed to hit a pepper so spicy that my mouth was numb for a few minutes. I thought that I was possibly crazy until my husband had the exact same experience (and he really enjoys spicy food).

Overall, I had a good enough experience to be intrigued enough to give Smoke another try, but they aren't currently at the top of my list of must-go-to places at this time."}
{"text":"I know many concentrate on the Tacos here but this is the best BBQ joint in Western PA and now replaces Smoque in Chicago to me as the best BBQ place east of the Mississippi. 
Went in for happy hour today after a muddy sloppy day at the US Open Oakmont. Very quiet due to the rainy weather. Great open brick Decor inside terrific bartenders who are knowledgeable on both food and drink. 
 Happy hour prices are great. Had a great local brew and two terrific $3 Sliders ..Brisket and Pork both with their slaw. Had a big crock of their baked beans which to me are best I will ever have anywhere....spicy and amazing!! 
Tried my buddies smoked poblano peppers stuffed with sausage and topped with cheese in a terrific gravy they were amazing. Also tried the fried potato poppers that top their salad really really good interesting.
I observed their kitchen crew a few times and I could see the care and preparation they put into their food.
Lawrenceville is an interesting neighborhood still a long way to go ..nice eclectic downtown."}
{"text":"I visited Smoke for carry-out a couple months ago, just a bit after they had opened. It seems some of their timing issues have been cleared up, but I did carry-out based on that fact: I will go back to eat in, because it's a cool little spot with a casual environment. 

Got a chicken taco, veggie taco, and the jalapeno apple slaw. The veggie taco was phenom. I know all you meat-heads out there are giving me the giant WTF face right now, being there is a brisket and a pork taco on the menu, but seriously - this taco was unbelievable. Chicken was good too, but it wasn't the best chicken taco ever. Was just lacking a little kick, I think. The slaw was great - good blend of vingear and cream, just the right amount of jalapeno, and little chunks of apple. I ended up putting this on a turkey sammich I made the next day for lunch and it made a tasty combo. 

I see there's now a potato salad on the menu too, in addition to some 'specialty' tacos ... looks like I'll be back soon and maybe with a few Sol to wash it all down!"}
{"text":"Okay, I admit it. I kind of wanted to hate this place. This is purely based on what I've heard from others, of course, but I got the impression that it was one of those hipster, annoyingly trendy, trying-hard-to-be-cool-while-pretending-not-to-try places. 

And....it is kind of all of those things. But the service and food completely won me over...so it is impossible now for me to hate :)

First thing's first....yes, it's crazy busy here. On a Sunday night at 7, there was an hour wait. They do use the NoWait app, but you can't just sign into the app and put yourself on the list like with other restaurants. Because Smoke is so cool and different ;) they don't conform to the normal NoWait M.O.....instead you have to call them on the phone to get in line. Then they will text you a link to the app that will let you track your place.

Because it was so busy, we said we were willing to eat at the bar, and that's where we were seated. The bar seating is tight, so it kind of sucked rubbing elbows (literally) with the random dude beside me...but first world problems, right?

The barista was our server and she was super attentive and sweet. Because we had not been there before, she explained their concept and gave us recommendations on how much food to order (2 tacos per person is apparently standard).

We started with an order of the \"Hot Bowl of Cheese\", which is essentially the best freaking queso I've ever had in my life. It's a mild cheese sauce spiked with smoked peppers and onions....crazy flavorful. It's served with homemade flour tortilla chips fried to a consistency that is simultaneously crispy and chewy. If I had magical powers, I would seriously consider hooking myself up to an IV of cheese sauce that I could tote around with me wherever I went. It was so, so good.

For dinner, I got a veggie taco and my hubby got the special taco of the day (which was a chicken and waffle taco). Then we split an order of mac and cheese. Although they recommended two tacos per person, between the queso appetizer and the mac and cheese side, one taco each was more than enough for us (and in fact, we took most of the mac home). The tacos were OUTSTANDING. It can be hard to make a veggie taco interesting, but they managed to pack it with smoky and spicy flavors. And the chicken and waffle taco was to die for....perfectly crisp chicken, soft waffles, and a sweet/spicy blueberry jalapeno sauce. Putting all of those flavors and textures together might have made for the world's most perfect bite. And let's not forget about the mac and cheese! It was insanely delicious....rich and creamy with a super sharp cheese sauce (I LOVE mac and cheese with a bite!)

To wash everything down, we tried both flavors of their agua frescas that they had that day (cantaloupe and watermelon). Both were super refreshing, fruity, and lightly sweet. A perfect complement to our meals.

The only downside here is their prices. YIKES. Be prepared to open your wallet. Psychologically, it's hard to pay $8.00+ for a side of mac and cheese or $7.50 for a single taco.....but they really do back up their prices with amazingly fresh, homemade, flavorful food. So I guess that eases the pain a little? Oh, and speaking of prices, it's cash only...which I find annoying. I mean, it's 2015...at this point, I think I should be able to beam payment directly from my eyeballs to the restaurant. But whatever. Credit cards are probably too mainstream for Smoke ;) So I will begrudgingly pull out the cash for my super-high-priced, but super-freaking-delicious tacos. :)"}
{"text":"If all I was rating was the food this review would be a rave and easily five stars. Where do I start? The heavenly smell that greets you as you walk in the door? The salty tangy goodness of the queso? The beautiful variety of savory meats? Or the unique but delicious cocktails they'll whip up for you? But sadly a restaurant experience is not only about the food. If the food were a heavenly experience  then the customer service is something akin the deepest stinking sulferous recesses of hell itself. So you walk in right? All excited for a Smokey tasty experience only to be barked at that the wait is fours hours. Welcome to the first part of your hellish experience with their staff my friends. So then you mill around the street, look in some shops, do a little dance, look in more shops, then finally it's your turn for a table. I won't bore you with every little detail of the utter condecesion and superiority complex you will be treated with so I'll sum up. Slow as molasses service that judges you for your menu choices, either crowds you or is nowhere to be found and then eventually rushes you out the door to turn over the table. All the times I have visited the customer service has been a consistent  nightmarish experience akin to tap dancing barefoot on hot coals. Food? Five stars and then some too bad the service is a solid firey zero."}
{"text":".....Burger tuesday, had by far the BEST burger on this planet. Classic mayo, homemade ketchup, pickles, no burger joint this side of Pittsburgh has it close to Smoke. Worth every penny and then some. A must eat. Period."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars but it is impossible. I went to Smoke last night with 5 of my friends. It was kind of mixed on how hungry people were. Two people just wanted mac n' cheese, one just wanted to drink and the other 3, including myself, were really excited to try the tacos. I ordered one chorizo and one wagyu brisket taco. Both were spicy and good but lacked in the veggies department. My boyfriend was a mac n' cheese eater and I thought it was ok but he was not a fan at all. The noodles were pretty overcooked but I did appreciate the sharpness of the cheese.

All in all, the food was not a major issue. I will most likely not be coming back to Smoke because the wait to get our food was insane. We waited close to an hour for 8 tacos and two orders of mac n' cheese. I have heard people complaining about waiting for food before but that seemed mostly when the new location had just opened so I figured it would work itself out. Unfortunately, the wait is too long that it cancels the positives. Luckily, there are great taco places all around Pittsburgh. So my need to go to Smoke is non existent."}
{"text":"Another great little Lawrenceville spot. Really good concept, food was delicious although pricey. Nondescript location. Limited selection of craft brews."}
{"text":"BBQ wrapped up into a delicious taco - it's really all you can ask for.

I was lucky enough to try Smoke with a large group who had graciously put our name in 2 hours ahead of time. When we were finally called from our bar hangout next door, we walked past many couples and groups waiting to sit through the unmarked door. There aren't many seats in this joint, but I feel the experience was worth the wait.

Our waiter was fantastic, taking care with every order and very attentive. We ordered several appetizers, but did I mention it's BYOB? Make sure you stop next door at the 6 pack shop to pick up a few drinks before stopping in.

As for the food, the tacos are spicy, and they do not mess around! They are way larger than I expected and two were more than enough.

We also tried the Mac and cheese, topped with brisket. I know a lot of people saw that this place or that has the best M&C, but this one takes the cake."}
{"text":"SO good!  Went here on a busy night (Saturday) and had a short wait.  Ordered the queso to start, the chips are definitely all they are cracked up to be.  They are fresh, slightly crunchy, yet chewy in the middle like pita.  Queso had good flavor and wasn't spicy.  Taco wise I got the burnt ends (amazing) and the BLT with chicken (this was a little too spicy for me).  Drink wise I wouldn't go for the margarita - it was overpriced and lacked flavor, really only tasted tequila.  All in all I highly recommend and will definitely be back for more burnt ends!"}
{"text":"Great for take out but atmosphere is a low point. We hadn't been to Smoke since it was in Homestead so I was ready for a yummy taco. The food did not disappoint. Both my favorites, brisket and chicken apple were delicious. Service was fine. But the music was obnoxiously loud combined with ambient noise to the point that conversation was impossible and digestion questionable. As I walked past the kitchen I noticed it was quieter there. We took our order to go. The new place looks hip but I couldn't enjoy it. Sorry we couldn't stay because we really like you guys. Missing the quiet little place in Homestead that was all about good food."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner to meet an old friend from Colorado about a month ago, after my client recommended Smoke. As DJ J. mentioned, Smoke offers a delicious variety of meat options atop fresh soft tacos with impeccable cheese and sauce/topping combinations. I loved mine: pork cheek with blueberry chutney, or some derivation thereof. We also tried the coleslaw and the mac & cheese, and both were delicious. I ordered the horchata to drink, and it was also good. And we got to munch on jalapeño crackers & cheese while we waited for our food.

The ambiance was hip and simple, though due to the positioning of the door, it can get a bit chilly / breezy, so be sure to bring your jacket inside - you might be wearing it. 

p.s. it's cash only!"}
{"text":"Excellent and very unique little restaurant that serves mainly tacos but other dishes with smoked meat.

I absolutely adored the mac and cheese, corn and broccoli side dish, and burnt ends. So flavorful and presentation was awesome. My gringo taco with handmade tortilla was pretty good as well, but it came out lukewarm unfortunately,

I highly suggest coming on an off day when you won't have to wait in line to be seated. Also, definitely try their lemonade!!

Although I enjoyed the rustic atmosphere and food (for the most part), it was super stuffy and hot in there. Also, cash only which was a huge inconvenience.

Overall good experience and will come again when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I love the simplicity of the menu, they don't have a bunch of food, they just do what they have very, very well. The staff is extremely welcoming and helpful with recommendations, and is honest without being pushy. 

The chicken taco was out of this world, I would highly recommend it. My dining accomplice had the brisket, which was also excellent. Basically anything you get on this menu is almost sure to please. 

Good Mexican food is becoming more ubiquitous in the city, and this is a key addition to this all important (in my mind) cuisine."}
{"text":"I don't know if I would classify this as \"Mexican\", I think Mexicans would be really insulted!  I was excited to try this place especially as I stepped foot into this quaint little place that had the scent of barbecue sauce in the air.  The anticipation was growing as our very friendly waiter told us the specials and we tasted their excellent SPECIAL DRINK OF THE DAY (aqua fresco with wild cherry juice), definitely the star of the meal!

Then...wait...wait...wait some more...and finally the food comes!  

WING SPECIAL - was too salty, even for my date who has a high salt threshold
PORK and CHICKEN TACO - skimpy toppings, very small for what they cost, nothing to write home about
JALAPENO APPLE SLAW - a good complement to the meal

In summary, it has a good location close to the movie theatre, friendly attentive waiters, excellent drinks, and I really was taken by the barbecue sauce smell in the air.  BUT the slowwwwww service (c'mon, it's just tacos) and the small ho-hum tacos make a TACO TRUCK look miles better."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere & food to match.  Limited cocktail & beer list, but it's worth the trip for the food alone. Will return many times."}
{"text":"Overall this restaurant has a really good vibe inside and out.  The service was really good, and the food was even better.  The mac and cheese was some of the best I've had, chips were amazing, and the smoked meat in the tacos was delicious.  Everyone in my 6 person group enjoyed themselves.  Also the homemade soda was unique but very tasty.  Overall it's a great spot to eat at a really good price in a convenient location.  I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I've only been to Smoke once, and I'm already looking forward to going back. The tortillas alone are worth the trip! They make them in-house and I'm guessing it's their use of buttermilk (so I've heard) that gives them an incredible flavor and texture. I've also heard that if you're a vegan and you know you'll be going, call a day ahead, and they'll make you vegan corn tortillas, as well. One thing you don't need to worry about? The tortillas falling apart!

The atmosphere is really quaint and chill - almost coffee shop-esque - and the staff is almost TOO nice. It's cash only, so come prepared, but there's an ATM for those who don't know.

I ordered four different tacos, the mac and cheese, and fritos with queso. I also ate a BLT taco that my wife couldn't eat. Yes, I went a little overboard, but I wanted to taste as much as my stomach could handle on the first trip. There was a nice variety of flavor in each taco, and the prices were reasonable. My only complaint was that the pork and the brisket were a little dry (overcooked, perhaps?), but I need to go back to see if that's an anomaly since I've only heard great things about the brisket. 

The mac & cheese was good, but we didn't really eat a lot of it and focused more on the tacos. The fritos were literally Fritos, but the queso was really good. Different than your typical queso, but good.

Overall, you can't go wrong with giving Smoke a try. There aren't a lot of places these days that are doing this good of a job of combining great service, good food, and a positive vibe."}
{"text":"With a larger, more conveniently-located restaurant in Lawrenceville, Smoke's hype had gone through the roof, but I think it's finally slowing a bit. Is the hype worth a 2-hour wait? Never...but the food IS, indeed, quite excellent! 

The new space is open and offers plenty of seating in comparison to its predecessor in Homestead, with old high school gym materials and industrial pig sculptures offering a nice reclaimed vibe that's so familiar these days. The staff is usually really nice and the food comes out quickly, so if you insist on waiting for a table, at least you know the table turnover is pretty fast! We usually just go when they open, and we're in and out of there in 30 minutes or so. 

Obviously, admiring metal pigs and sitting on old gym bleachers isn't why you'd venture to Smoke. You're there to eat...and they serve up some AWESOME tacos. With their amazing buttermilk tortillas that continue to set the standard for durable vehicles for bbq smoked meats-to-mouth delivery, they already have an edge over other taqueria-inspired restaurants. Then, factor in their deliciously-simple tacos, featuring smoked meats (or potato nuggets, if you're not a carnivore), and it's hard to go wrong! My go-to options are the brisket taco and the pork, but I don't really discriminate, and I've had nearly every taco on the menu. Also, keep an eye out for the chicken & waffle taco, with cornbread fried chicken with cornbread fritters and blackberry (I think) jalapeno syrup. Unreal stuff!

The sides are good, too. The mac & cheese is filthy, and we always get the jalapeno apple slaw. That stuff is amazing! The special desserts that Smoke makes are also worth a try. They've always been heavy hitters that'll leave you in a food coma, but some of their pies are definitely worth it!

Overall, Smoke's hype is mostly warranted. We've been there countless times, and rarely walk away disappointed, but it helps that we go when the place is dead. I'd recommend you do the same! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"For a second, I though I was in the incorrect place based on all the 5 star reviews but after eating at Smoke TWICE, I now feel ready to give an honest review.

I love, love, love getting my taco on, and couldn't wait to sink my teeth into a little Mexicali taco-action. The seating is very sparse and dark. But, its very cool because it is a historical landmark! I guess when I think taqueria, I think brighter colors and more seating. At least perhaps they should put some artwork on the walls? There are only 3 tables, one of which is very large. A lot of unused negative space. The tacos were good, but I guess I don't get the hysteria? The Chicken Apple taco was good, but dry. Same thing with my veggie taco-- dry, dry. I asked for extra avocado, which was a kinda bland cream with no flavor. I mean, I love avocado cream and Mexican cheese but it seemed like they missed the mark.

And....where was the cilantro? Or fresh, homemade salsa?

I know that the focus is more on the \"smoke\" BBQ aspect, but \"taqueria\" is misleading. I also wanted the inside to smell like a BBQ, and it did not. And for a small taco wrapped in foil with no plate or silverware it is a tad overpriced. I may return, but I would not use Smoke as an example of how we do tacos to out of town guests. 

Oh, and it is CASH only. Annoying to me, since I never carry cash, but it seems pretty common in the 'burgh so, OK."}
{"text":"Can the hostess be any more rude. The older blonde lady is absolutely the meanest, rudest person. You walk people to their table...Check yourself. Cocktails and beers are good. Good selection. Quite tasty. Food was ok. Average. Tako is way way way better. More flavor. More interesting combinations. The food was fresh though. Service is slow and not the most attentive. If you are busy, hire more people. And get rid of your hostess. With all the other taco options in this city...I would not come back."}
{"text":"I used to love Smoke so much when it was in Homestead. I feel like some of its charm and the quality of the food has gone downhill since its move to Lawrenceville. We've had several meals in the new location and I never leave thinking \"God, that was SO good\" like I used to."}
{"text":"Remember to bring cash, otherwise there's a conveniently located PNC bank right next door ;) 

I wouldn't say this is my favorite place to get a taco. My primary complaint is no corn shell tacos? What's up with that. 
Their veg taco and cornbread is insane(ly good) but I've tried the pork and burnt ends taco and they just don't cut it for me. They're just not as flavorful as I thought they would be. Also they don't come with any fixings, it's just meat in a flour tortilla, bland wrapped in bland."}
{"text":"Looks like they brought back the late night happy hour, which is great. The menu changes, and this time the $3 ribs are replaced by $1 whole wings with a smokey BBQ sauce and blue cheese. The drinks are still very cheap and the donuts are an unexpected surprise."}
{"text":"Downright appalled. I waited 2+ hours in a jam-packed entryway whilst watching countless others being turned away. Service was slow and unimpressive. Food arrived, echoing prior disappointment. The portion sizes are abysmally small. The added requests of cash only and one check further supplemented the issue. The food itself was nothing to write home about. The beef was overcooked and stiff, and the sauce was overtly spicy to the point where the underlying flavors were completely masked. Overall, I was completely dissatisfied and warn others considering a meal here to consider a more reasonable price and wait for such utter mediocrity."}
{"text":"Expensive for what you get. Happy hour is 4-6, half off drafts that are $7.00 to start with. $5 margaritas that are not great. Menu is very small. Typical one taco per order, but each taco was $4-$7 each! Oh and they are cash only! And can't split checks. Just a headache to go there with multiple couples. They also didn't have AC."}
{"text":"Hostess is absolutely zero help. I live in NYC and they operate doors with 100% more respect, but have much more imporant restaurants. I'm sorry for Pittsburgh who's trying to make a name for themselves in the culinary scene, but this clearly not going to help. Love the city, but not the restaurant."}
{"text":"mmmmm.  Taqueria.  The word itself evokes such happiness.  I've heard lots of buzz about this place, and when I had a meeting in the neighborhood, I took the chance to check it out.  It's a pretty sparse place, with only a few tables and stools.  But it still somehow looks trendy.  Empty-chic?

I took a paper menu and sat at a stool, and a server took my order.  My horchata appeared quickly - if you haven't tried this before, I highly recommend it, and Smoke makes a nice version.  Horchata is made differently everywhere, but you'll usually find it milky and spiced with cinnamon and vanilla.  It's actually made with rice, but don't let that weird you out.  It's pronounced \"or CHA ta\" and Smoke's version has a little bit of lime zest on top, which was fun.

My tacos took a solid 15 minutes to appear, which was fine - it isn't fast food, but I also didn't experience the super-slow service people described below.  I was there at 130 pm on a Thursday, for what it's worth.  My tacos came wrapped in foil and presented to me with napkins - I get that it's street food and all, but I sort of expected, since I was \"dining in,\" that there'd be like.... a plate.  Even a paper plate.  So things got messy.  Though that is part of the fun of tacos.

I got the chorizo taco and the veggie - both were tasty.  Chorizo was $4, and veggie was $3.  They are bigger than hard-shell taqueria tacos, but they aren't too big...Maybe 1/3 the size of a Chipotle burrito?  Two tacos were PLENTY for me.  The server recommended two tacos and a side dish for one person - but I'd say only do that if you are HONGRAY.  I couldn't stuff all that in my face, no sir.

The chorizo taco had pinto beans in it, and some salsa goodness.  It was fresh-tasting and yummy....the tortillas are handmade, but they are flour tortillas, and I think they could really use a corn tortilla option, just sayin'.  I liked the veggie one, filled with corn and black beans.  The veggies were cold in the taco, which was also not ideal, and I would've loved some cheese on them, but they did not have that option listed on the menu.

So my meal was $11 for two tacos and a dandy horchata, which I think is pretty spot-on fair.  Easy parking on 8th Ave cost me a quarter.  I think this place is a nice addition to the Pittsburgh area.  The food is appealing, but frankly, it's not hugely different from Chipotle.  And Chipotle is delicious, don't get me wrong.  Smoke is a great place to visit, but it's not doing enough to stand out from the rest of the pack.  Well, I guess it is in Pittsburgh, it's really the only place like this that I've seen here.  And that's saying a lot - I think the Latin American influence on the restaurant seen here is improving, and that is something to be excited about.  I'd come back, with my boyfriend, the next time we crave Chipotle but also want to spend our dolla dolla bills on a local business."}
{"text":"I can't get over whether this is a BBQ or a Taqueria. I get they're trying to combine the two but it's inconsistent and doesn't work overall. While the macaroni and cheese is delicious, the tacos I tried (pork and veggie) were dry and relatively flavorless. I don't understand why they are delivered to the table wrapped in aluminum foil, it's weird and downmarket. I also HATE (sorry) the strange, prison-style slop trays that you're expected to put your side dishes onto. The server seemed taken aback that we would want actual plates rather than a 9\" x 12\" tin shingle to eat from. Visited in early April and the space was freezing. Room for improvement indeed. Almost forgot: I've never had horchata with a strong bitter aftertaste?"}
{"text":"Two stars just for the value and if I'd recommend this place to a friend. Maybe three stars for food quality... Smoke has a major pretentious hipster vibe, so much so that you actually have to know exactly where this place is and what's inside because there is no sign or markings outside...oy vey . Anyway, the place is nice although it's pretty small. Our server was nice but had the whole hipster \"we're too cool for you\" attitude and I don't think she ever made actual eye contact with us. The rest of the employees obviously have an affection for skinny jeans (are you sensing a pattern here?). As for the food, I ordered the special, which was a Cuban sandwich and fries and while good, it was overpriced at $12. My girlfriend got the ribs TACOS (which we thought would be plural, i.e. More than ONE). But alas for around 8 bucks (she added a scoop of avocado), she received ONE medium sized foil-wrapped taco on a metal tray. When it arrived we both immediately looked at each other, knowing exactly what the other was thinking. WAY, WAY, WAY overpriced for the quantity and quality received. If it had been April 1st, we would have thought we were being pranked. Total bill for our meal plus a draft beer and a coffee came to $32. Oh, and they only take cash, but fear not because the sign out front clearly says they have an \"ATM up in here\". I guess the PBR drinking crowd can't get a debit or credit card? If you're considering this place id say skip it unless you have cash burning a hole in your pocket and want to pay 10 bucks for some queso and chips, all while being trendily ignored, then I say go for it."}
{"text":"Eh. It was good, don't get me wrong, but I can't get over the flour tortillas. I had the chorizo taco and a side of mac&cheese... but the flour tortilla... tacos are supposed to be on corn tortillas. They're lighter and allow you to eat more of the delicious meat filling!"}
{"text":"We were almost scared off by the reviews that said it could take two hours to eat here, but we came on a Wednesday, and it was busy but not crowded. The rib taco was excellent, but the churizo taco was a drippy mess. My wife had the brisket  and the pork, which were both pretty great as well. The mac 'n cheese was really good, but just slightly overcooked, and a little bit watery. Those two issues keep it from being really great (compared to Union Pig and Chicken, where the mac 'n cheese is just about perfect). It's a bit pricey for tacos, but the smoky melt-in-your-mouth goodness of the meats justifies it. When you leave here, the smell of smoked meat will be stuck to your clothes!"}
{"text":"Another awesome taco joint in Pittsburgh. I love the rustic feel of the restaurant. My friend and I started the meal with the queso and I would say it was the highlight of the meal. The homemade chips were the best chips I've ever had a restaurant. They weren't too crispy or too soft and they tasted so fresh. The queso was also probably the best queso I've ever eaten. 

For my actual meal I got a rib taco with a side of the Mac. The meat on the taco was a little chewy but it had a good taste. I think they make homemade pickles and they are very spicy and good. The Mac n cheese was also delicious but I think it would have been better with meat on it. 

Overall I think tako has better tacos despite what a lot of people have said. I was told the tacos were better and cheaper at smoke but I personally disagree. Tacos at smoke are sold as 1 taco versus 2 per order at tako making them almost he same price depending on which option you pick at smoke. However the tacos were still good and the queso was amazing so they still get a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"It started out as my favourite BBQ place in Pittsburgh and I really loved going here every time. Gradually though they got rid of all the nice food and now they are serving overpriced Tacos and drown little pieces of BBQ stuff in cheese sauce. It just went to a giant fancy rip off. Don't go!"}
{"text":"Tacos are my favorite food, but instead of being a taco purist, I'm more like a tacoventurer. (\"Tacoventurer\" is someone who relishes exploring any and all iterations of tacos, you've not heard this? I made it up, that's why.) 

I always like it when a restaurant limits themselves to doing one thing and doing it really well. Because Smoke is essentially only tacos and a handful of Tex-Mex appetizers I was seriously excited for this meal. But I dunno man, I'm not feelin' it. 

The fact that the tortillas at Smoke are unorthodox--each taco comes wrapped in one thick flour tortilla, similar in density and texture to a gyro pita and with the heft of a petite burrito--was an interesting idea, but ultimately wasn't fully realized: the bread was bland, and chewy in a way that when eaten with the contents made everything mushy in your mouth. No crunch, no firmness for contrast. It was sort of like eating taco ice cream. (I know, taco ice cream sounds twisted but possibly delightful, right?) Although I understand they do offer corn tortillas, next time I'll try that.

Okay, enough about bread texture, on to fillings. We tried four different tacos (ribs, pork, chicken apple bacon, and brisket) and all of them were forgettable. That's sad! That's so sad. A taco is basically just filling wrapped in an edible napkin, so you gotta make your filling sing! I don't even have a specific criticism of the seasoning it was so meek and unobtrusive.  

Tex-Mex is about bold flavors, and an interesting fusion of culinary classes and cultures, but taken as a whole this place felt like the chef was too apprehensive to unleash some Lone-Star-State-inspired fury on us. But we're tough, we can take it. 

Rant over. 

We also had the Frito pie (can I say? I really like a restaurant putting Frito pie on the menu). I've had Frito pie in people's houses smothered in canned chili and Kraft American cheese that was delicious (no lie); this Frito pie was not like that. This had a stewed tomato topping that was, alas, also lacking in any real kick or memorable flavor. 

I *was* charmed by their Mexcian Coke in glass bottles, but deeply regret not trying the horchata. But you gotta love a mom and pop outfit, and judging by some of the more creative offerings (BLTaco) on the menu, I think there could be good things in the future. They just need mas fuego."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken and apple taco. Taste was good. Kind of expensive for what they give you.

Nice atmosphere. Very hipster. Went once. Won't be back."}
{"text":"*happydance*  - I have found the yummy!

Like a pot o' gold at the end of a rainbow, I have found Smoke.  I usually take pictures of the deliciousness before I indulge, but I couldn't wait to dig in.  The menu isn't huge, but it's fresh and delicious.  

I opted for the pork taco with apricot habanero sauce and caramelized onions.  I also selected the jalapeno apple slaw.  A little spice, a little sweet, a little savory... A LOT of yum!!  

My boyfriend chose the daily special, Cuban sandwich along with the creamy, ooey, gooey mac n' cheese.  Let's just say I made him \"share\" his mac :)  Incredibly delicious.  Just writing this makes me want more.

When we received the check, my jaw dropped just a little.  It's affordable AND delicious!!  Congratulations, Smoke - you have won over my tastebuds.  I will be back and SOON :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We weren't planning on coming here, but glad that we did. only downside is cash only, but there is an ATM inside and across the street. 

We got a few different tacos, an app and the aqua fresca (honeydew special). The drink was amazing, fresh and tasted great. 

The queso dip is unreal, and the bread they serve with it is so warm and perfect. Nice job there. And there is a ton of it, we didn't finish. 

For tacos, we got the Migas, Egg, Chorizo and Pork. We made these a little custom, but they were great. The tortillas are warm and fresh, and don't break!  The chorizo was just ok, I probably wouldn't get that again. It was more ground chorizo, not sausage form which I was expecting. The egg was incredible, I got it with Rib meat and avacado cream, both nice touches. That was the best around. 

And we ended with a freshly baked cookie, chocolate and PB.

Great place, go there."}
{"text":"Tips: CASH ONLY

Happy hour: 4-6

parking: there is a pay lot across the street

I went here before an event at Bierport and it was during happy hour. My friend was already at the bar and I sat next to her. I waited at least 5 minutes or so before the bartender even acknowledged me. I ordered a beer that was on special for $2.50 and we ordered 2 mystery tacos and the mini queso and chips. 

The mystery taco idea is really fun and cool! The chef just tosses together whatever ingredients he wants. One of ours was a smoked pulled chicken with bbq and crispy onion straws. The other was a ground beef I think with roasted corn. The homemade chips were good, only complaint was that a few weren't as cooked and crispy as the others. 

I will definitely be back to try some more mystery tacos!"}
{"text":"Smoke is known for their barbecue inspired tacos (which are delicious, especially the Chicken Apple - my personal fav) but their mac & cheese and queso are items on their menu not to be missed. I know that sounds like a lot of cheese (this is coming from someone who really loves cheese) but you only live once so double up or you'll just have to go again and again."}
{"text":"My experiences here are generally great!  I've been for tacos in the past, but recently went for a BBQ plate.  

My partner and I split the 2 meat, 2 sides bbq plate and it was plenty for the both of us!  It was also priced right at $20.50.  We got the burnt end and 1/2 chicken for our meats.  I've always been a fan of the burnt ends and this time did not disappoint.  I was very impressed with the chicken.  We have been to bbq places all over the country and have had a hard time with smoked chicken and dryness.  This chicken was the juiciest I have ever had!  We got the coffee and apricot habanero sauces which were both good, I just wish they would put all the sauces in squeeze bottles instead of having to choose 2 little containers of the 6-8 sauces.  For sides we got the cornbread and broccolini and corn.  I would pass on the cornbread, I like sweet cornbread and this was not sweet.  I seriously dream about the broccolini and corn on a regular basis I love it so much."}
{"text":"Where do I start?! Amazing. You first walk in and you smell the smokiness from the wood. I really liked the layout, a little small but the lighting and simplicity made the experience. 

Food: I started off with a pineapple aqua Fresca spiked drink, which was very refreshing and quenched my thirst. My friend had the triple peppered Margarita which was also very good with a little kick at the end. We decided to split both the queso and the mac and cheese. The queso is a big serving probably good enough for 5 people. The chips were crispy homemade pita chips that came out warm. The queso was extremely good. Hard to stop myself from eating all of it. The mac and cheese was also delicious. Perfect amount of crunch, cheese, and smokiness. I also ordered the brisket taco. It was out of this world! The BBQ was extremely good. Very simple taco but made to perfection. If you come hungry I would recommend ordering two. 

Overall amazing food! Keep in mind it's cash only!"}
{"text":"The tables were not too clean and rickety. We came in after dinner for drinks - none of us liked the drinks. The night ended with everyone downing the drinks since that was the easiest way to finish them. In short, not coming back again."}
{"text":"We were seated at 630 on a Sunday and we didn't get our chips and queso for an HOUR, and our three tacos for another 15 minutes after that. Food wasn't better than \"fine\" and not worth the price, and definitely not worth the overall bad experience. Not worth trying again. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Such good quality food. A little pricey but it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"What this place does, it does perfectly. They're known for their tacos, but don't let that stop you from their other offerings. Small menu, but with enough variety to satisfy most palates.
Smoke's mac n cheese is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Good food and drinks, but painfully slow and inattentive service. A friend and I came for dinner and drinks around 7pm on a Wednesday. The hostess was very nice, but was inexplicably overwhelmed and flustered. I know hosting can be stressful, but the restaurant is small and casual, and there were plenty of seats available. Perhaps they were short on staff (?), but this process was so much more difficult than it needed to be.

Once we were finally seated, it took at least 10+ minutes before we were acknowledged by wait staff or even given water. We were informed of the special taco of the evening (fried chicken), our drink order was taken, and we were then given more time to decide on food. I ordered a margarita and my friend ordered a beer. We also ordered the bean dip to split, and each ordered a taco (yes, one taco each, because that's what you get for $9). Our drinks then took another 10+ min.

The bean dip was ok, although I think it was literally just beans with a little cheese and one cilantro lead. I'm still not sure why it was served with toasted garlic bread rather than chips. Our tacos did come quickly and were rather good, thankfully. The pork was tasty and the tacos were a good size.

Once it was clear that we were slowing down, we were offered donuts that our waiter claimed were \"just out of the oven\"! We passed and just asked for the check (heads up that it's cash only). As we were about to leave, our waiter took our cash- which was clearly inclusive of tip dip due to the $1 bills on top- said \"I'll bring you change\", then ran off before I could object. He never came back. 

I really wanted to like this place, but it just wasn't worth it. Their home-smoked meat was good, but not worth the slow service. If I were in the area again, I would not return."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere
I am a vegetarian and they had a nice selection of tacos and sides that were meatless.  I had the veggie taco and the broccolini and corn which were both very tasty. Only complaint was that the music was ,though very fun, 90's rap, Tupac and NWA, was not particularly appropriate for young children.  Overall great and would recommend highly"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I have been here.  The first time, I showed up and they were closed.  No sign in the window of hours.  I decided I wasn't coming back.  Miriam convinced me to return.  I was encouraged by all the good reviews as well.

We were greeted and sat by the owner.  She was really charming and friendly.  I ordered the rib taco and the veggie taco for which I added chicken.  They come with hand made flour tortillas.  I really prefer corn and expected to be disappointed but they were pretty good.  I still think that corn is better for you and better tasting.  

I don't like over the top spicy.  The kind that makes you sweat and your mouth burn uncomfortably.  She told us the only one that was spicy was the chicken.  Don't believe her.  They're all spicy.  These two were a good spicy but almost too much for me.  Especially since I wasn't really expecting it.

The rib taco was really nice.  It was smoky, tangy, with pickles.  A little sweet but really pretty tasty.  The veggie was equally satisfying with corn and poblanos.  I liked these.  With a couple mango drinks and my wife's order of another taco and a side of beans the total was $24.00 and I was still hungry.  No judgement here, it's all quality food but you decide.

I would have given it 3.5 if I could have because it's better than a 3 and they're really making a concerted effort here to get it right.  They even posted hours on the door!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not even sure where to start. We got to Smoke on a friday night at 7:15 and were told that it would be a half hour wait - not a big deal. We went to a nearby bar to pass the time and at 9:15 - 2 HOURS later - my boo got a call saying our table was ready. That actually wasn't what made me dislike this place, we were actually nicely buzzed, in a good mood and ready to eat. We ordered the veggie tacos and the mac and cheese to share and this is where I got mad. After 15 minutes of waiting for our food, the mac and cheese was cold and hard. Our fault for waiting around to eat here but NOT okay that our food was cold. Our waitress was slow and apathetic about everything. So over this place and the hype surrounding it. We will def not be back."}
{"text":"Holy SMOKE!    First up in the list of wonderfulness to be experienced is the service.  I'd called ahead to check whether or not corn tortillas were available to accommodate my gluten issues. I was lucky enough to have my first opportunity to talk with Nelda, the wife half of the Smoke duo.  Nelda said she'd be happy to set some homemade ones aside from breakfast service for me....just let her know when I get there and she'd take care of everything.  And she did.  Warmly.  With Nelda's help, we built a couple of tacos without any gluten problems at all. 

The brisket.  Everything you've read here about the brisket is true.  THE BEST BRISKET IN THE CITY!!!  Mine came with avocado cream, pickled onions and fresno hot sauce instead of the porter bbq sauce (porter = beer = verbotten gluten).  I can't imagine anything being better than the smoky, creamy, spicy taco that was created.  I didn't stop there, I also had one of the new tacos...the Chicken, Apple, cheddar, smoked jalapeno mayo and house cured and smoked bacon taco!  Loved it.  It made my taste buds dance!  

My husband really enjoyed the Philly taco....brisket, onions, hot peppers and a sharp white cheddar sauce.  I wasn't able to sample it, but he was a very happy camper!  He agreed it was the best brisket anywhere.  He enjoyed the mac and cheese while I enjoyed the apple jalapeno slaw...both measured up to the tacos....outstanding!  

The horchata was sweet, spicy with cinnamon and delish....I think a shot of spiced rum would be an awesome addition.  And since SMOKE is byob, you could do that!  The hubby - as cautious as he is about new tastes - enjoyed his agua fresca - a strawberry version - quite well.  Again, maybe a shot of tequila would take it over the top?

Our SMOKE break on way to Kennywood Christmas on Saturday evening. was one that will be repeated....often  We can't wait to go back and give everything on the menu a try.  Next time...breakfast at SMOKE!  One last thing...SMOKE has not only the best brisket in Pittsburgh, SMOKE has the BEST TACOS IN PITTSBURGH!!!!"}
{"text":"at here on 3.29.14 at 6pm. #1 - not enough tables, place fills up in 2 seconds; #2- got seated and then it took, and i kid you not, 35 minutes to get 5 tacos and some macaroni and cheese. 2 different bugs visited me while i was eating, i was a fruit fly, the other unidentifiable. my rule: when flies are present, never go back - wait staff was \"eh\" - the manager had a great attitude but what's up with 35 minutes for tacos and bugs? sorry, i expect more out of a restaurant and won't be dining there again. i'll hit up yo rita or some other location with similar product and faster service and NO BUGS."}
{"text":"I stopped in this place for a short time while waiting for a movie next door. It was my first time here. I loved it from the moment I walked in. The decor was awesome.  It's definitely a very trendy place. Lots of exposed brick, wood, and cool lighting. I only stopped in for drinks, so I cannot speak to the food. 

It was a Friday night and I was a bit disappointed to find that they were closing at midnight because I would have loved to spend more time here. They had a late night happy hour beginning at 11 pm which got us half off beers and $5 margaritas. The experience was all pretty great. Bartenders were nice and helpful in drink selections. The only downside was that it's a cash-only establishment, but there was an ATM located in the back for convenience. Definitely a sweet spot for a date night."}
{"text":"I hoped for Smoke to be amazing! However, the service is woefully slow and surly. After waiting for a taco for 90 minutes, I asked if my waiter knew when the food would come, and he angrily responded that the kitchen was small and it takes a while for food to come out.

The food is overpriced for the quality. The meat is consistently dry which is a quality they attempt to cover with sauce that is not so much a flavor but spice. The beans were akin to overturning a can of pinto beans into a bowl and adding tabasco. 
When a friend told the waiter that the beans were not satisfactory in any way, the waiter argued that they were very good and that we were wrong. 

It is not worth the wait or the money. Lawrenceville has several other options that are better quality with better service. There is better Mexican available all over the city. I would rather eat at Chipotle and be served in a timely manner with quality control. 

However, the bathrooms are very nice. 10/10 would pee again."}
{"text":"Tacos, mac n cheese, the best chips in PGH and queso, agua fresca. You cannot go wrong with anything at this cash-only joint. It was a hard year for me during their move from Homestead to Lawrenceville. So happy at the increased seating. Worth the trip to the ATM and the wait!"}
{"text":"Visited this place as it was one of the few restaurants in Homestead with 4 or more Yelp stars.  

Food (8.0/10) = Wow, there's some creativity going on with these tacos.  Ordered the chicken taco (with avocado cream, pickled onions and hot sauce), and the rib taco (with pickles and porter barbeque sauce).  Was blown away by the flavor profile.  Friend ordered one of the breakfast tacos, and was impressed as well.  The only disappointing thing about the meal was the mac and cheese.  Only ordered it, because it was mentioned quite a bit on yelp.  Maybe I got a bad batch?  Finishing the bowl became a chore (I don't like to waste food).  Their horchata is pretty good as well.  This place is also BYOB.

Ambiance (7.5/10) = Came here in the evening, and almost missed it since there is no obvious sign from the outside.  The street this restaurant is on felt shady in general.  Didn't look like there were many businesses around.  As for the interior, a very casual and laid back atmosphere.  

Service (7.5/10) = Our waiter was nice and great in helping to choose which items to try since this was our first visit.  Unfortunately, it took forever to get our food.  Not sure how many people are in the back making the tacos, but it seemed like maybe only one considering that it took more than 30 minutes to get 3 tacos to our table.  I was informed later that on weekday nights, the speed of getting the food to the customers is reasonable.

Overall opinion = A unique taco joint with creative bold flavors.  Probably going to stay away from the mac and cheese though.  Be aware, it takes a long time to get your food on Friday/Saturday nights.  BYOB, cash only place."}
{"text":"The wait is long and they're cash only but their brisket taco is to DIE for. It's juicy and has the perfect burnt smoky taste and they pack so much meat in the tortilla it's quite filling. Also had the pork which was NOT quite as juicy, but dry actually, but still delicious. They let you do take out and so head over the Atlas Beer Works next door and grab a beer downstairs while you eat. It's the perfect relationship between the two stores. Also their Mac and cheese side, very delicious as well and you get a good portion of it as well."}
{"text":"Great place! I did not deduct any stars for the 35 minute wait, because the place is making such great food, it's only natural that people are flocking here!

We came here with the kids, and were pleasantly surprised to see a decent kids' meal - a rarity these days. Yes, I had the usual Mac n' cheese and potato bite options, but it was several steps up from a chain restaurant kids' menu flavor wise. Our kids loved the broccolini and corn, as well as the Mac and cheese.

For us, we got the salad (no meat added on), which currently is a tasty mix of greens, house made potato bites (we ARE in Pittsburgh, after all!!!), cherry tomatoes, and a bleu cheese dressing. We decided to go for 4 total tacos, which is crazy, unless you are a college kid. One taco is enough to be an adult's main course - they are not skimpy. We chose the pulled pork, chicken, brisket, and chorizo. We had originally wanted the rib taco, but it was later in the afternoon, and they were out.

My favorite was the pulled pork, followed by the brisket, then the chicken, and finally the chorizo, although all four were ridiculously flavorful and the meat was well smoked. I do wish that they would turn down the spice just a little bit on the brisket and chicken tacos in order to let the meat do the talking, but the spice wasn't overwhelming.

All of the staff we interacted with were super friendly, and the food comes out quite fast for a full restaurant - sounds like they've worked on this from some of the earlier reviews. It's BYOB, and there's a beer shop next door and a wine store across the street. The iced tea and lemonade were superb, since we didn't feel like partaking in wine or beer at the time.

When we were done, we asked them to box up the leftovers (totally miscalculated - one taco per person is quite filling if you're eating a side dish or salad, and aren't a college kid...) and it was done quickly and efficiently. It's a cash only establishment, so estimate before you go and stop at one of the banks that are literally next door - or you can use the ATM in the back.

Overall, it's a great place with great food - well worth any wait you may have. I'm very pleased that it lived up to all of the hype I've read for the past two years! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This will be one thing I will sorely miss about this town if I do ever leave.

These are 100% the best tacos in this town and second only to the street tacos I had in Mexico.  It also gives Salt a run for it's money as my favorite restaurant  in Pittsburgh.

The boyfriend and I have made a new rule that we are only allowed to go once a week.  The food is that good.

While we have never waited less than an hour for our food, it does not at all color my opinion of the place.  Our strategy is go in, place our order and take a horchata to go and go grocery shopping/run errands in the mean time.  If you do it that way, there is no waiting at all!  And if you are going for dinner (and they are still open!) head down the street to Blue Dust  for great beers.

I have had all the tacos and most of the sides across multiple visits.  The tortillas are hand made everyday.  Amazing.  The taco filling is BBQ style meats.  It may be the best brisket I have ever had.  The sauces are flavorful running the gamut from zesty to melt your face off.  The chicken taco is the most spicy, so watch out!  I would also recommend getting the avocado cream on all of your tacos.  It really adds the right amount of fat and texture to the already astonishing tacos.

Two tacos, half a side and a horchata are generally enough for me.  The prices are mid range.

Worth the wait, worth the price, and better than any of the hype."}
{"text":"I have read many, many reviews about SMOKE and finally had the chance to go.  Simply amazing.  Flavors of nearly all tacos (a group of us shared six) were extraordinary.  Mac & cheese as a side for tacos?  Hell yeah - creamy and delicious with a nice sharp bite at the end.  Waitress was excellent as well.

As you already know from other reviews:  cash only and BYOB.

With so many good things to say, we were astounded to be the only patrons much of the visit.  (4:30-5:45 on a Sunday).  WHERE ARE YOU PEOPLE?"}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews, I felt a little let down. I had the chorizo taco which was good but a little expensive for a single taco. The mac and cheese tasted sour which was really disappointing."}
{"text":"I can't even deserve how great these tacos are. My husband and I each ordered 3 tacos thinking that they would be small. We were so wrong. The restaurant provides extra large proportions and the meat is so filling that you can barely even finish one. For typical dinner I would suggest 2 tacos each; that way you can try them all without becoming too full. The margaritas are delicious too"}
{"text":"If Smoke were any more hip, it might be a cliche; instead it's just extremely good food served in a warm, relaxed atmosphere with a healthy dose of fun. While the meal wasn't perfect, the flavors were excellent, and some of our tacos packed a fair amount of heat, which was a pleasant surprise.

We got the veggie, brisket, pork, and chicken tacos - the veggie was excellent, not a menu afterthought at all.  The other tacos were really good, though we felt that the level of heat sometimes overpowered the original flavors, and the pickled onions and mustard seemed to be AWOL on the brisket taco - but with meat cooked that beautifully, who cares? The agua fresca was a great complement to the meal, even on a wintry evening, so don't miss it if you're even mildly curious.

Bottom line? I feel like I could order almost anything here and be happy and well-fed. Smoke has set the bar pretty high for good food in Pittsburgh for me."}
{"text":"A refreshing different restaurant for the Pittsburgh market! Ordered chips and pico - is not in the menu but sure should be. Pico was very fresh and has a good spice level. Fresh made tortillas fried up in house. Apple Jalapeño slaw was delicious- nice vinegar mustard type sauce. Sampled 3 tacos: the vegetable with added chicken - no salsa on it so a bit dry, but had nuggs (sorta like croquettes) on taco, the pork - very tasty, the fried goat cheese chicken taco- was excellent. Not a typical taco at all. Nice atmosphere- a bit hard to locate- no sign but right next to the Rowhouse theater."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in PGH!!

Love everything on their menu. Brisket (tacos or sandwich) is my absolute favorite thing. They also have a fantastic dessert menu. Their house made doughnuts with ice cream is to die for."}
{"text":"The rib dip was amaze. The drinks were on point.  I had a margarita and my hubby a whisky sour. I got the brisket taco and chicken taco. The brisket was good but a little dry. The chicken was so spicy I was sweating. Lol. My husband got the burnt ends. He wasn't impressed. He also said they were dry. The brocollini and corn was very good as was the jalapeño slaw. No complaints on the service.  Everyone was very friendly and super hipster. I like the atmosphere of lawranceville but will probably try a different restaurant next time we go to dinner that way. Maybe just go in for a drink next time we visit"}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would. I am going to hash this out while it is still fresh and steaming. Steaming like the pile of crap that is Smoke.
My family decided to patron this dumpster fest. We were a party of 15 that came in around 5pm, we spent over $500 over the course of 2 hours. Let's begin. We walked in to smoke staggard, the hostess refused to seat us at our reserved table because she couldn't see the whole party. The hostess was rude and disenchanting. When we finnaly sat down, we had to wait an excruciating amount of time for any service. When we did, in short, it was crap. After we ordered, we also had to wait another distasteful amount of time for the food to come. For how short their menu is you would think that they could push some food out within a reasonable amount of time. The food, while not terrible was mediocre at best. Around the time we were finishing up the hostess walks by and gives us a dirty look for reasons still unknown. We make our complaints known to the owner who seems understanding. After which customers who are now waiting in the lobby begin harassing our whole party for the purpose of removing us from our table. There was absolutely no tact involved. Why would this be related to the Establishment? They cited the owner who was standing right behind them. They mentioned things like \"we know the owner\" \"the owner wants you out\" \"you all should be ashamed of yourselves\" intermingled with personal attacks at individual members of my family who up until this point had no interaction with the morons. All in all we get up to leave after 10 or so minutes when the owner doesn't say anything and they continue. This continues until the moment we all left. Needless to say, we will not come back. The food and service alone were horrifying. And the treatment we were allowed in the presence of the owner by the owners friends sealed the deal. May their Establishment be condemned according to their own actions. ~V"}
{"text":"I have been there before. Food is very good and I have recommended the place to many others. I was surprised to find out that some people mentioned waiting up to 1 1/2 hours for their food.  They said the explanation was too many take out orders. 
I experienced it myself tonight. The waitress told us after an hour that it would be another 25-30 minutes for our food because they were busy with take out orders.........seriously???
The place has 4 tables. If the business model is to focus on takeout orders, say so up front. Doesn't make a lot of sense. Most, if not all of their fillings are PRE MADE. Slap it in a tortilla and give it to seated customers. People calling in expect to wait a few minutes. Not so with seated customers. 
Owners need to review business model and prioritize what it is you do. I left and went to Peruvian restaurant and had a sit down dinner, with appetizers in under an hour.  Get it together!!!!

Have returned several times. They have figured it all out. Dine in diners are treated as a priority. Awesome.
The migas and bacon are my favorite but I have had the rib, pork, all of them. BEST in the city....hands down. BTW..the Mac n cheese is also best in city. Cheesy, topped with crunchy bread crumbs . Melts in your mouth..
Thank you for the turn around focus."}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of barbecue. I've explored whole animals--brined, injected, rubbed, smoked, marinated, roasted, slow-cooked, hung up on a spit, cooked over rocks, or wood fires, or sous-vide until melting off the bone. I've had intimate meat-sweats from over indulgence everywhere from Oakland, California to Harlem, New York. I've ordered ahead to skip the line not to save time, but to make room to expand my extensive collection in an afternoon. I've complimented pickles in Austin, ordered extra potato salad in Penn Yan, and even pushed a layover further out to make a pit (beef) stop in Chapel Hill.

Every barbecue joint has it's own heroes. \"Get the turkey here,\" or \"try the char-grilled wings there,\" or even \"this joint rules, but stay away from the..\" I can't tell you the hero of Smoke. They're all so goddamn good.

Everything at smoke makes me so happy. At first, I would go out to their Homestead location and fill up on smoked wing night. Then, I'd bring a bottle of tequila to their Lawrenceville location to enjoy some margaritas (they would provide the mix) and a few tacos. Now, they have their own drinks, a rotating and legit beer list, and have managed to make every menu item just as good (if not better than) the one before it. The sides are perfect. I like the broccolini and corn, and the mac-and-cheese, and the potato salad. I also like the mac salad, and the cornbread, and I always make sure to get an extra plate of pickles. The burnt ends are my usual, but if there's a fried chicken special, get that one, too. Usually, we'll pick a few meats and maybe a sandwich and split it all.

You'll probably have to wait if you come in here for dinner, but it's worth the wait. It's also cash only, but they have an ATM in the back. When you're done eating, they'll probably tease you with whatever awesome desserts are on the menu. You could get dessert, or you could just order more meat instead."}
{"text":"The black bean dip with avocados is amazing. You can choose how many tacos you want for every kind!"}
{"text":"The rib dip is hands down THE best thing EVER. I wish I could have unlimited amounts of the dip on hand at all times. And the chips that accompanied the dip were almost better than the dip itself. For my dinner I ordered the BLT with chicken taco and the brisket taco. BLT taco was made perfectly the brisket taco was way too spicy for me, which means a lot because I live for spicy food. We had macaroni and cheese as a side which was wonderfully creamy. When we were there it was during December and it was FREEZING. I wish it would have been warmer in the restaurant because I was shivering the entire time. They only accept cash but they have an ATM in the back of the restaurant and are located right next door to a PNC. Would definitely go back here again for the DIP and to try some different tacos."}
{"text":"This is one of the most unique and exceptional restaurants in Pittsburgh. The queso is the best I have ever had. The burnt ends are to die for and the gringo salad was amazing. They make everything from scratch and I mean everything!  Fun, cool, and upbeat atmosphere make this place a perfect night out!"}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what to say other than this place blew away my expectations. I heard the buzz about Smoke for a while, and living in Lawrenceville waited patiently for its opening. It took a few weeks to get here but Smoke didn't disappoint. 

The tacos are amazing. The Pork Taco was tender and juicy with a slight spice from the apricot habanero salsa. Mmmmm. The Apple Chicken was really good too, but not my personal favorite. My wife also got the Pork Taco and thought it was really good. I also got an Egg Breakfast Taco out of curiosity and now know I can come here for a late breakfast! I tried her Brisket Taco and wished I had gotten that instead of the Chicken Apple, although she thought it was a little too spicy. The Mac and Cheese was perfection. Creamy and tasty with a lovely baked crust on the top. Some of the best I've had. 

We brought beer to drink and they even kept it in fridge for us to keep it cold. The server was very friendly and helpful with menu choices. He even told us we could call ahead and put our name on the list to save time. 

While I originally thought the prices for a single taco were high ($5-7 each) I now edit my thinking because they were absolutely worth the price. Smoke is delicious and trendy, and definitely worth the recommendation. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!  Loved the look of the place and the atmosphere, it is a little cold inside but, nothing one of their good variety of beer cant fix, also prices per taco are a little high but makes up in flavor and exotic flavors.  I guess I'm trying to say it is the perfect place if you are looking for something different in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I heart Smoke! The restaurant is very welcoming with its hipstery decor. My favorite tacos are the chicken apple and migas. All of the sides are excellent. I've been here many times as I live in the neighborhood, and the quality is consistently good. The wait time for a table is dicey (not sure if/when they'll begin taking reservations) and the wait time for food is a tad long, but so worth it. Meow!"}
{"text":"We have been to Smoke a couple times now, and as I write this review I'm literally salivating thinking about going there again. Just imagining how good this place smells is enough to make me want to jump in my car and drive there. You will thank me after you go and have your own fantastic experience. The place is not large so you may have to wait but to assure you the wait is worth it. Make sure you bring cash with you as they don't accept credit cards here, but there is an ATM here. It also isn't he cheapest taco place you'll find but quality ingredients aren't inexpensive. We started with the queso. START WITH THE QUESO!!! You MUST get an order of queso, either regular or a doctored up version with burnt ends or pork. It is so cheesy...full of poblanos, Fresno chilies and onions and accompanied with homemade buttermilk tortillas that are fried to perfection. This is a very large portion for an appetizer too, between my husband and I we can barely get it down (but we are also saving room for tacos...) They also have handcrafted soda, $5/pop but totally tasty. We tried both the Burnt Ends and Chicken and Apple tacos. My husband(and I agree) That a waygu beef spoils you for ever eating another taco in your life. Tender, flavorful beyond belief meat and the coffee bbq sauce is just the right amount to make your tastebuds tingle. The chicken and Apple was also very good. This is another unique taco you just can't find everywhere. We also tried the mac and cheese side which was just mediocre in our opinion. Definitely not a bad dish, but when you're comparing it with everything else it pales. I'm telling you that you cannot go wrong with Smoke. There is street parking and also a paid parking lot just down a block across the street. No military discount here."}
{"text":"The last time I came here, I had a bad experience with the way that my food was cooked. I was kindly given a coupon for 20% off of my next purchase, and decided it was worth another try. I came here when they first opened and was blown away by how good every single thing was. I figured that when I had a bad experience, it was just a bad night. It happens... and it happens again. During this visit I ordered a cocktail (can't remember the name) that had burboun,  lavender, and citrus. It was SO sour and tasted like nothing but unsweetened lemonade. No lavender flavors, and I could barely recognise that it contained burboun. I also got 2 tacos that I've gotten in the past, a mushroom & an egg taco. The mushroom taco was mostly refried black beans and has these awful burnt onions that were gritty and created the worst texture of any food I've ever had. The egg taco had burnt eggs and the potatoes that I was looking forward to tasting were sopping wet with grease and not even a little bit crispy. I figured, what the hell, at least I have this amazing mac & cheese. I have had a true LOVE for this mac, but this time it tasted like NOTHING. There was barely any cheese and it simply didn't have any flavor to it . My boyfriend for a chorizo taco and said that he couldn't even taste the meat that was in it. I can understand having a mediocre vegetarian dish at a BBQ joint, but to have tasteless meat? Unacceptable. I would have complained, but I feel like it was my own mistake for coming back expecting something amazing. It was about $60 for 4 tacos, a side of mac, 1 beer & 1 cocktail. I don't mind breaking the bank for good food, but this was NOT good food. Thank God I had that coupon and didn't pay full price. I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"I absolutely loveeee this place. The place itself is nice and has trendy decoration. The food is absolutely perfect. I've tried almost all their tacos and they're each better than the other. Absolutely recommended."}
{"text":"I've only gotten take out from here, so I cannot comment on the service. But I love the chicken/apple and brisket tacos and the mac & cheese is splendid. Remember, cash only. This is the only reason I carry around cash on me, to eat here on occasion. Very good."}
{"text":"You can almost miss this place as you drive by on your way to the Waterfront. 

We ordered take out from here and it took 35-40 for it to be ready. Seemed to be about the same amount of time to get a table at this joint. This place is busy with good reason as the food is delicious. 

Ordered:
Mac and cheese - crumbles of toasted taco crumbles added a nice taste. Very creamy with cheesy consistency. 

Pork taco - close to $5 kinda pricey for Pgh, but a good amount of tender meat was in the taco

Egg taco - meh.  

You can tell the tortilla is made fresh daily but it's not like the authentic corn taqueria version ...still tasty. 

They have a variety of flavorful and original salsas to choose from.  I got the avocado cream and either mango or papaya habanero. 

Noticed on the menu they have a $2 / person corkage fee. If you bring your tequila you can purchase margarita mix from them. 

Parking is plentiful. 
CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"Thank you yelpers for helping me find this place!

The wait was half an hour around dinner time for two people, so we just walked around Lawrenceville in the meantime, waiting for the text notification that our table was ready. 

The setup is interesting inside. It looks like more space is set aside for the decorations than the seating area, but I guess it's working out for them. I ordered the migas taco because I like eggs, and smoked red cabbage because that sounded interesting. I noticed that some of the sides cost more than the tacos. The wait wasn't too long for the food, which came out wrapped in foil and the little cauldron-like thing for the smoked red cabbage. 

To be honest, the migas taco reminded me of the sausage egg and cheese burrito at McDonald's with some spice and green bell pepper--but I still liked it. I think it was the cheesiness that made me first think of that. The smoked cabbage had a surprising flavor. The smoky-ness was very nice and powerful, which I really liked. 

I'd want to come back and try their other tacos too. Also it's BYOB at $1.75 a person."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend on a Thursday night. This place is a racket. I had two of the chicken tacos. Honestly, I could make better. There was nothing spectacular about them, least of all for 5 bucks a taco. On top of all of that the restaurant layout is horrible. The tables are extremely close to one another, which can make things really loud. We also waited a hour for our food, which was just two tacos wrapped in foil. No fixings, no fresh lime, or onion. No sauce options. And we had to constantly flag down our waitress, while many attempts were being ignored. She barely checked on us.  Take my advice, go down to the strip and go to Casa Reyna. You'll get authentic tacos at a decent price, and the staff will take care of you. This place is for hipsters with no taste."}
{"text":"Wait: my husband and I went to grab dinner around 6pm on a Saturday night with an hour wait (no biggie). We were placed on their NoWait list--but oddly enough, you can't add yourself to the list from home--you have to check in in person first
Drinks: decent beer at decent prices. Kind of odd they didn't have an accessible list of drafts. Had to walk to the other end of the restaurant to see the draft list.
Dinner: They were out of multiple items from the menu. I ordered the brisket and my husband got the ribs. My brisket came out lukewarm and sparse. Husbands ribs were super salty, but tasty. The best part were the sides--mac and cheese and baked beans
Dessert: we both got glazed donuts. They weren't donuts...it was basically a fried and glazed hamburger bun. Would not get again...yuck!

I'll try it again--but wasn't floored right out the gate!"}
{"text":"best Mac N Cheese Eveerrrrrr. tacos rock as well. Also had a spicy vodka drink. All were delish. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We called ahead and they put us on the list...2 hour wait so they said they would text us when table was ready. We said we had five when we called ahead, but when we arrived they put us at a table for 4...the table was so tight one person had to eat at a corner and stand.  We did see a table for 6 open and requested to be moved, but they would not do that because they wanted to split it up to accommodate others who have been waiting....Strike 1.  After seated we waited 10 minutes to get menus, served water that was warm (no ice), was sitting near the front which had no air circulation and felt like AC was not running (but it was because other parts of place you can feel it), waited another 15 minutes to place order...in the meantime I went to the bar to get drinks and ice since no one seemed to be waiting on us....Strike 2.  Waitress came and took order...meal was served in about 15 min...but waitress did not even ask one time during the course of our meal if we wanted water, drinks, etc... Strike 3.

Now for the food quality...it was very good BBQ...but not worth wait!!! 

You can serve the best food in the world, but if service is poor odds of me visiting again is very slim.

Also...at 8:00 PM on a Saturday they were out of Burnt Ends and BBQ Beans....how can a BBQ restaurant run out of those...should have plenty in holding ovens ready to go."}
{"text":"Okay so the good first.  The taco and mac + chili were unbelievably good.  So good that I cannot fathom giving this place a bad review.  Next time I am in Pittsburgh I will undoubtedly go back,  I will just be more prepared with a book, or movie.  And a lawn chair.

I cannot figure out what took so long to make our food.  There were a handful of other folks in the restaurant (which, coincidentally is how many people it takes to fill the tables) most of whom already had their food when we got there.  We were lucky enough to get two bar stools that were so short that our chins rested on the bar but hey, we are just ordering tacos so we won't be here that long, right?
I ordered the brisket taco and the mac + chili.  My wife ordered the chicken taco and the mac + chili.  The thing about brisket is, you cook it a damn long time.  More or less chili gets the same treatment.  It wasn't as if there was food being constantly run from the kitchen, so what in the world were they doing for the hour it took to get our meal?  About half of their reviews say the same thing, so I think more than being upset over the wait for something that should have been out in ten minutes, I am confused why they haven't figured it out yet.
The byob thing is, in my opinion, also a problem for their operation.  As we, and a few other customers were sitting on uncomfortable stools or standing, praying for one of the three tables or one adequate bar accommodation to open up, patrons at all three tables were finished eating but continued to open beers and pour glasses of wine.  We finally asked one of the tables, who honestly appeared to be leaving, if we could have their table when they left and they got upset with us because they still had beer left.  

And more as a Pittsburgh review but as they fall into this category I think it is relevant.  Why in the hell does no one in Pittsburgh take credit cards?"}
{"text":"Let me preface that I am from California and I am a huge taco connoisseur! 

Visited smoke two days in a row that is truly how good this place is. To start the atmosphere is nice and I appreciate the space being small and allowing intimate dining.

We started off with the house queso which is so delicious with its homemade chips. The queso is not your typical queso but it's packed with chicken, avocado, and delicious sauce.

Food wise, these tacos are literally some of best in the city. I've tried the pork and chorizo tacos and they are so amazing. The taco shells are so delicious and you can tell they are homemade. 

The mac with burnt ends is amazing! The burnt ends are so delicious and full of flavors. This was a great surprise to the menu.

Hands down this place is a spot!!! Try it try it try it!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of Pittsburgh's best kept secrets!  Amazing food and a great atmosphere.

Service wasn't speedy.  But my party wasn't in a huge hurry.  So it didn't matter one bit!

We all shared the nachos and queso.  Plus we each had a taco and split the Mac and Cheese.  Every bite was better than the last.  

Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Smoke was the absolute best it's ever tasted! We called ahead for reservations for 8 and were seated quickly. I had the Brisket Taco and Mac-n-Cheese. (We actually shared the Mac, Broccolini, and cornbread.) Everything was wonderful! 

Service was exceptional. 
Food was exceptional.

I want to add I recently ordered a gift card online and they couldn't have been more accommodating toward me. Such wonderful owners and staff! 

Smoke is legit."}
{"text":"All of my enthusiasm for SMOKE's tacos and food still applies (read my previous review), but I want to add a few notes about the service and wait times, since everyone is finding out about how delicious this place is and it is getting more and more popular!

If you come on a busy night (e.g. Friday or Saturday, and maybe Thursday too), you should expect to do a fair amount of waiting.  You will wait for a table -- I waited 25 minutes for a table for two on a Friday night (scale this up for larger parties).  You will also wait, after you are seated, for your tacos and food.  The last time we came on a Friday night, we waited 45 minutes for three tacos.  Some tables waited up to an HOUR for their food.

Personally, I don't really understand why the wait needs to be so long.  It's not a 3-course meal... most everyone seems to be ordering tacos and mac 'n cheese here.  If the restaurant seats that many people, the kitchen should be scaled and staff to accommodate feeding that many people in a reasonable amount of time.

That said, their food is still worth the wait to me.  After several visits, the tacos are still 5-star-worthy deliciousness.  But, if you come here on a popular night, BE PREPARED TO WAIT for them!  Do not forget to BYO favorite alcoholic beverages, and lots of them, so you can drink and be merry while you salivate hungrily for up to an hour for your tacos.

I'm guessing this is also a very popular place to have a pre-Waterfront-movie dinner... great idea, but make sure you arrive at Smoke and get on the waitlist 2 hours before your movie starts.  Otherwise, you risk cutting it pretty close or missing your movie and you will be too angry to enjoy the deliciousness that this place has to offer."}
{"text":"In my humble opinion, Smoke is one of the best places to get BBQ in Pittsburgh. It just happens that their delicious meat tends to come in tacos, but this is not a traditional taco place. Also, their new menu has a stronger focus on standard BBQ fare (ribs, etc.) while still offering 5 or so flagship tacos.

My favorite tacos are the brisket (so, so good -- worth every penny of the price, in my opinion) and the pulled pork. I love that habanero sauce that they put on the pork taco.  It's a great sauce to ask for on the side if you get their mac and cheese, too. I tend not to love m&c because it tends to be bland, fatty, and uninspired feeling. Smoke makes one of the few m&c's in the city that I actually like -- it's super garlicky and flavorful (sharp cheeses) with just the right mixture of textures.

On Tuesdays, they do not serve their normal menu; instead, they do burgers only!  I really think that they make the best (basic) burger I've had in Pittsburgh.  Good beef, nice and smoky flavor, and that BUN is to die for.  It comes out so warm, so soft, it's probably the best burger bun I've had in recent memory.

The agua fresca is really great for summer, and it seems like you can get it with gin or tequila. The gin cucumber agua fresca is my new favorite drink for the hot months of summer. It is so refreshing!

Be mindful that this place can get quite busy during peak hours, but its popularity is well deserved!!"}
{"text":"SMOKE didn't miss a beat when they reopened in Lawrenceville. They're still BYOB and happen to be next to a craft beer bottleshop right on Butler St. I always have trouble only picking 3 tacos, but my starting lineup would be the Chicken Apple, Pork, and Ribs. Don't forget about the Queso with homemade pita scoops or the White Cheddar Mac, and do yourself a favor and add bacon!!"}
{"text":"Up in Smoke!

Here's what I really appreciated about Smoke Taqueria...the inventiveness of the menu!  Instead of taking your everyday, ordinary Mexican influenced menu towards Taco Bell hell, the chefs decided to infuse this country's barbecue tradition into a latino inspired road trip.  The beef brisket, chicken and pork tacos had a smokiness rarely encountered in local restaurants.  You could smell and taste the love!

The side dishes that we chose were Macaroni and Cheese and Pinto Beans.  The macaroni and cheese was okay (My daughter Muff loved it, though.) and the pinto beans were tasty.  They also had a duck special that was quite special.  Not overcooked or greasy, I thought that it was a tasty dish.

My only complaint with the restaurant is the spottiness with the operating times of the restaurant.  The owners must get a better handle of this... Went on a Saturday during hours of operation and the place was closed.  My party, along with another party made a special trip here and had no idea that the restaurant was closed.... I live in Penn Hills, so this was definitely an inconvenience"}
{"text":"This ain't your mama's taco joint!  I remember venturing to Homestead just to check out this eclectic joint.  Fortunately, we returned and were greeted by an extremely friendly staff that made us feel at home.  It was like some friends got together and decided to invite a few more friends to enjoy their new take on tacos.

Fast forward, and now they're located in their current Lawrenceville location.  Same warm coziness that I got from the other location, but with more space.(Thank the Lord!)  My daughter Muff and my sister Luch were on our way back from a food event at the John Heinz History Center, but we still had a few empty pockets in our tummies that need to be filled with some delicious food.  Hence our trip to Smoke.  We wanted to keep things light (Hah!) and decided to go with the \"Burnt Ends\" dip, \"Rib\" dip, Chorizo taco and \"Gringo\" taco.  Whew!

Heads up!  Smoke doesn't serve traditional flour or corn tortillas, but they have their own unique buttermilk flour tortillas.  The recipe gives a slightly different chew to their tortillas and when fried, provides a little more heft to the tortilla chips than regular tortilla chips.  That extra heft doesn't take away from the chips at all and provides a better counter-balance to the heartier Burnt Ends and Rib dips.  You can't go wrong with burnt ends, buttermilk and bleu cheese!  And the Chorizo and \"Gringo\" (Ground sirloin and brisket with pico de gallo, avocado cream, cheddar and crispy tortilla crumbs) tacos were on point!

We left stuffed to the gills with no empty tummy pockets to be had!

It's a little pricey as far as tacos go, but definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Step 1 - use NoWait. (You're welcome ... that was some free advice.)
Yes, it's a hipster taco joint. 
They may have ... served me warm water, but that's a thing now, no big deal.
Waiter was great, was familiar with how everything was assembled and cooked. 
BYOB ... don't forget. 
Again ... Bring Your Own Booze ... (You're welcome ... that was some more free advice.)
I was a little b##ch and had everything custom made. They did it and it was all fantastic. Had one of each taco they offer and enjoyed them. 
The cheese dip was pretty nice. Chips are made in-house, very thick, almost like naan. Still quite good. 
If you use NoWait and have some booze @ Industry or go bowling, it's all good. 
Quality is as good as any taqueria I have ever been to.
You should stop in and enjoy, it's pretty good."}
{"text":"While the food was absolutely delicious, the service was a bit slow. I think this is because they very clearly cook everything fresh and to order. That's great, but I just wish they could find a way to serve the food a little faster. That being said, the food was awesome!
I ordered the duck appetizer with the orange ginger sauce on the side. I also got a chorizo taco and added avocado cream. The chorizo taco was just the right amount of spice...not overpowering, but a little bit of a kick to it. The taco was a perfect little size, with plenty of flavor. It was served rolled up in tin foil. The duck appetizer was also delicious...and the sauce was the perfect accompaniment. Just those two things alone made up my meal. It wasn't a huge stuff your face meal, but it hit the spot. It was about 11 bucks for those two items. I did not try any agua fresca and am regretting it because it looked very refreshing and good.
I'd definitely go back, even though it was a tiny restaurant, the location is odd, and the service was not all that speedy. I hope to see the restaurant expand and make some improvements in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Great place to take a date or go to with friends. The dining area is a bit small but it has a great atmosphere, have only been once but they have a great well rounded menu. Lots of fresh, deep flavors. Just had the queso for app and it was amazing with the chorizo and some of the apple"}
{"text":"This place is super hipster, but the food is really good, so I don't mind slipping in and out for takeout (I think i'd lower the cool factor pretty quickly). 

Agua fresca is so so good - watermelon was the flavor du jour. 

We tried the chicken and brisket tacos, both of which were very very good, and the mac & cheese, which we thought was kinda just ok (alot of great reviews though, so maybe just not our type of mac). 

The tacos are big, so you probably only need 2 a person. 

Will visit again after they've moved."}
{"text":"Best tacos in the city. I had written an earlier review where I complained about the temperature issues and long wait, but those have been resolved. 

The tacos are absolutely amazing. I like to get the chicken and chicken apple. The meat is tender, and the flavors in the tacos are very well balanced. You always feel like you're getting a taste of all the ingredients, nothing is overpowering. 

I love that on the Chicken Apple you can taste some apple, but the delicious cheese and bacon flavors are taking center stage next to the chicken. 

The regular Chicken taco has a delicious spicy avocado sauce that adds a lot of flavor alongside the cilantro. Great for people who like some spice. 

I also highly recommend getting a breakfast taco- my favorite is the egg because the combination of flavors is wonderful. There is definitely a sauce of some kind that really adds flavor to everything already in the taco. 

And the BLT for me was a home run- again it isn't just the flavors listed- whatever sauce was added was perfect, it brought out the bacon in a good way. The bacon is homemade and tastes like it. 

With all that said -$4 to $8 and sometimes $9 per taco is a bit ridiculous. And the fact that it's cash only as if we're saving money that way is a little ridiculous. When you can get a whole meal for $6 from a cash-only place like Pamela's- THAT is saving money. 

But go here, eat the tacos. Because they're delicious."}
{"text":"I took my main squeeze here for Valentine's Day. After a long morning of hanging out at Crazy Mocha trying to job search and do homework I thought that coming here would be a nice stop on our way back home. I went there first while Chris was packing up to even see if we could get a table. I was told that they could get us a table in about 20 minutes. Awesome. Even better is that I got the reservation and they would text me when the table was ready. I went back to get Chris to tell him the good news!

When looking over the brunch menu we decide to skip it and just order straight from the main menu. 

Appetizers:
Mac: roasted garlic, shallots, mascarpone cheese & white cheddar topped with corn tortilla dust

This was incredible. The cheese was that toasted crunchy top. The tortilla dust was amazing. Just the right amount of dusting that didn't take away from the creaminess of the cheese. The server tried to warn us that it was a lot for two people, pshaw.... Chris and I did not finish it but we came dang close! This was a great starter for us. Super creamy and not salty at all. I loved the burnt top that Chris and I fought over. Nothing beats slightly burnt cheese stuck to the sides of a bowl. 

Tacos:
Brisket: sauteed onions, hot peppers & mustard sauce
The mustard sauce really made this taco. I loved that it was spicy but did not have a weird vinagery taste that some mustard/bbq sauces have. The meat was cooked well and was not tough at all. The hot peppers, sigh, they were a little sparse. I would have had to eat half of the taco to get to the peppers. It seemed they were just on one side. I opened up the taco before and redistributed the peppers and onions.  I wish the brisket had more of a kick to it. I was told that the mustard sauce was spicy but it was not spread evenly on the taco to really get a good taste for it with the brisket. I also love sauces and would have liked to taste more of it on the taco. 

Chicken: avocado cream, pickled onions & fresno hot sauce
I thought that this taco was pretty good. I liked the chicken mixed with the pickled onions. I wish there were more onions though. I am a big fan of pickled anything so really, there were probably enough onions and I am just being greedy. I thought the chicken was cooked well, but it lacked any zing to it. The hot sauce and the avocado cream really had to be in this taco to make up for the lack of chicken zing. 


Chicken Apple: bacon, cheddar & smoked jalapeño mayo
Surprising. Really surprising. The apple really was a nice zing to this taco. I enjoyed the crunchiness of it and how the tart yet sweet tasted blended with the rest of the taco. I did not order this one for myself and can only say I took a taste. It was good!

Drinks:
Lemonade: Fresh lemon juice, water & sugar
Ginger-ade:Lemonade & fresh ginger syrup

I am going to lump both of these drinks together. 1.) Because they both tasted exactly the same. 2.) Fresh lemonade is always a treat and a must have when we go out and while good, it was not fresh lemonade good. 3.) For $4.00 a glass   (A REALLY SMALL GLASS) this will be a skip for us the next time.

I liked the experience and the food. I will say, it was a little bit too expensive for what we got. While good, I do not think we will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Came at 8pm on a Friday. Still had to wait an hour. It was totally totally worth it. We tried most of the tacos. The ones that blew me away were the chicken and the pork! Oh wow. Like an explosion in your mouth. Love the Mexican and BBQ fusion. It's like they were made to be together. Great ambiance, good service and BYOB! Can't ask for anything more."}
{"text":"A wonderful combination of smoked meats on fresh made tortillas, nicely creative additions to traditional toppings.  

Smoke was busy but we were able to get a table after a short wait.   Warning to those at one table with the old front porch metal chairs, several people did not sit back or hold the handles when sitting down and ended up on the floor...not good...no injuries.  

Was not real hungry so skipped the snacks.  The Agua Fresca - Raspberry is so refreshing.  Who needs a beer with my Taco when you can have the sweet agua fresca?  It is BYOB and most do!

Tasted the pork taco with a sweet-spicy apricot habanero sauce & caramelized onions topped with cilantro and the Wagyu brisket had a hot flavor due to the sauteed onion, hot peppers & mustard sauce topped with cilantro.  The contrast in styles was wonderful.  The meat was tender and smoky tasting.  The tortilla's were good but did not add much flavor; wondering what it would be like on a corn tortilla.  We shared one side of some of the most delicious mac & cheese..yum to the sharp cheese flavor.  Some of the other sides sound very appetizing, will have to give them a try next time.

Wait staff was very good, helpful, would stop by and check on us and refill water and agua fresca.

Remember:  Cash only!

As many have written, Smoke combines some really good smoked meats on fresh tortillas, with some great and different toppings. It can get crowded but we stopped by for lunch and were able to get seated immediately.  
The staff was friendly and one person taking our order and another delivering the food.   
You know they must smoke the meat when you walk in, it has the smoked flavor in the air.
The rib taco with pickles, onions and a BBZ sauce taco and the pork taco with apricot habaneros sauce were very good.  
The menu has expanded since my last visit at the Homestead location, but did not try any of the sides."}
{"text":"I was in a recording studio across the street when the engineer recommended Smoke. I took the rest of the band's orders and called over. The woman answered the phone, and when I told her I was placing an order for pick up, she asked me to hold. She actually just put the phone down because I could still hear everything. I waited, and waited, and waited....FOR 22 MINUTES! I finally hung up and called back....15 TIMES! The phone was still off the hook. 

Why do you give a take-out menu with a phone number can't handle take-out business?!

By this time we were starving, so I walked over. The woman asked me if she could help me. I responded that I was still on hold. She looked at the phone, and said, \"we're swamped\". I guess that's my fault. 

My order for eight tacos was quoted at a half hour. I asked her, \"Come back in 30 minutes?\". She said that I better not, and that she'd take my phone number because it would actually be longer. She was right. Nearly 80 minutes later....

The tacos were big...I guess that's why they're $4 a piece, and pretty good. Just please get your service together!! I know you're busy! I know everyone likes your food! Hire some more people!!! 

You guys could easily get five stars from me."}
{"text":"Only white tacos and limp burritos served here. Wheat germs and brown breads don't bother. Huge Attitude issues!"}
{"text":"Personality. First thing that comes to mind when I take my first bite. I have a real appreciation for all of the flavors that this place incorporates. I came in for the late night menu aka the mystery tacos lol. 

Creative combinations of vegetables, meat and spices make Smoke a top of the line restaurant. I could taste the smoking process in every bite of my meal. Next time I need to get here early so I can try more tacos!"}
{"text":"OMG!! The reviews were right this place is Awesome!! Everything was great. I had chips & queso, a bfast taco with chorizo, & a brisket taco. Fantastic! Can't wait to go back & try something else awesome."}
{"text":"I have heard about the place for a while and finally got the chance to go over the weekend.  The Queso was amazing.  The atmosphere was cool and interesting. The beer selection is small, but high quality and the cocktails good.   As far as the food is concerned, it was good but not amazing. The pork taco was spicy and good. The chicken was bland and disappointing.  

My biggest gripe was the service on a Sunday was awful, with a virtually empty early dinner crowd (5:30). We waited 10 minutes just to get waters and our server was slow with the first round of drinks and \"Misremembered\" our 2nd round so that we were finished eating by the time they arrived.  With so many more satisfying, better efforts nearby (Tender, Franktuary, Cure, and Round Corner), I can't imagine why we'd go back 

The cash only is annoying in this day and age."}
{"text":"This place always seems to be crowded! I came here at 5pm on a weekday and already all the seats were filled... Luckily, there were exactly three open seats at the bar for my two friends and me, and we took them. (I had previously tried coming twice before but the wait was too long.) I wasn't that hungry, but knew I had to try a taco, so I got the veggie taco with fresh avocado added on top. I LOVED the fried potato nuggets inside. They were perfectly crispy. Don't think I've ever had potatoes in a taco before, but they definitely made it memorable for me. If I were hungry, I probably would have ordered one--or even two--more.

{"text":"This is a great place for happy hour! We got lucky and were able to score two seats at the bar and avoid the hour-long wait for a table in the dining area.

I really appreciated the \"surprise taco\" special that they offer during happy hour at $3. We ordered several tacos and they were all different! I really enjoyed my steak taco, but am not sure I would have been willing to pay $6 under non-HH conditions (hence the imperfect rating). Still, as a SoCal native, I am having a hard time finding a taqueria that satisfies my craving for al pastor! In terms of upscale taco restaurants in Pittsburgh, I would wholeheartedly choose Smoke BBQ over Bakersfield or Condado. Also, Smoke is in a burgeoning neighborhood with several new restaurants that have opened up in the past few months.

By the way, I'm not sure if they make it clear enough, but this place is CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and loved it both times.  Not quite the best taco I have ever had, that distinction remains my own carnitas tacos with mango and cilantro salsa, fresh red onion pickles on handmade fresh toasted corn tortillas.  Anyway, I haven't had a taco here that I wouldn't eat again.  And the cheese dip is good too but oh so rich.

Super fast and not too expensive. Very friendly."}
{"text":"If the review were based solely on food I would give them 4 starts. I can't give them more than 3 stars based on overall experience.

My boyfriend and I had called around 4:30pm on a Sunday to make a reservation for 5:30pm. The host told us there was no wait and we shouldn't need a reservation for that time but he will put us down. We showed up at 5:10pm. The host said we may have to wait 15 minutes. Was a bit odd given that not long before he told us no wait and reservation wasn't necessary. 5:30 rolls around and didn't seem like it was any closer to us being seated. At 5:40 he tells us shouldn't be too much longer since people are getting ready to leave. He then updates us they are clearing the table... then we wait for 10 more minutes. When I asked him why he said they were waiting for forks to be cleaned. Its quite surprising that a restaurant can run out of forks during a time that is apparently not considered busy. Finally at 6pm we were seated. 

We went back the following night (Monday) as a friend wanted to try the place. We called just after 6. They put our name on wait list and said would be about an hour, but may be a bit sooner. One hour later we showed up and figured we'd be seated asap. Nope. We waited 40 minutes more.

I understand they can't rush people out who are eating or socializing. But, they do need a different policy for reservations. If their estimated time has so much discrepancy from reality they should refrain from giving estimates or taking reservations as both prove pointless.

The food was good. Between the two nights we tried several tacos. All but the pork one were good. The mac and cheese is good. 

The service was fine.

They do need to install a heater by the front door. The cold air comes in and regardless of how far back you are sitting it is quite cold. 

Since the food is good, but the wait times are terrible, and service isn't anything spectacular take out may be the way to go."}
{"text":"We've been waiting to try Smoke for a while, and we're so glad we did. It was delicious!!!

If I could only pick one taco, I'd go for either of the breakfast tacos. I know, strange choice. But seriously. They are great. The chicken was good. I liked the veggie as well.

Also say yes to: the queso appetizer! the black beans! the Horchata!

The place is adorable. It has a cute little bar. There are very few tables so if you go during \"prime\" meal times, be prepared to wait. We went at 5pm on a weeknight, and it was perfect timing. Still... everything is cooked to order, and you can tell that the kitchen is small because everything that you order comes out very slowly... but it's worth the wait!

P.S. Bring some beer or wine and put it in their old skool fridge to enjoy with dinner because it's BYOB.

I would agree that it's not \"real\" Mexican food, but it's good. Just enjoy it and don't worry about classifying it."}
{"text":"The first thing that hits you is the wonderful smoke smell, which I love. Combined with the decor, the atmosphere is quite homey and comfortable. Between my hubby and myself, we tried four tacos, all of which were fantastic - so I can't imagine there's a bad choice to make. The mac and cheese is among the best I've ever had; and, my super picky son actually tried something \"new\" and gobbled it up (BIG props to the chef for this)! We didn't get adult beverages - but the bar list wasn't lacking in options for beer and cocktails. The only drawback is that the prices are a bit expensive for lunch - so we'll probably only go back for dinner. Otherwise, I highly recommend Smoke!"}
{"text":"We wandered in on a recent Sunday, shortly after noon.  I was panicked to count exactly 3 tables and 2 stools at the bar.  All of them full.  A friendly server said \"don't worry, two of the tables are just finishing up\", and handed us menus to review.

After we nabbed a table, our server greeted us right away.  For beverages, BJ got a diet coke, I got a horchata.  What is horchata?  It's a traditional rice milk drink made with cinnamon, sugar and vanilla with a bit of fresh grated lime for garnish.  It was so good, I loved it and so did BJ.  

Of course we had to ask what was good. Apparently their menu has some new creations.  BJ ended up selecting both of his tacos from the \"new\" items.  He got a Philly brisket taco and a chorizo taco.  The Philly taco was nothing like a Philly cheese steak, it was more like pot roast.  He said the chorizo taco was very spicy and flavorful.  It was his favorite.  I stole a few pinto beans and tomatoes from this taco.  I got a pork taco with avocado creme and one of the new creations, a chicken apple taco with smoked chicken, house made bacon, apples, white cheddar & house made smoked jalapeno mayo.  The pork was my favorite by far, stuffed with lots of huge pieces of meat.  It was perfect.  We also got a side of jalapeno apple coleslaw to share.  We were both surprised that the jalapeno didn't have more of a kick.  But we loved the crispness of the cabbage and the dressing was yummy.   

This is me, eating at Smoke:  mmmm.......MMMMMM......mmmmmm.....  I thought my boyfriend was going to slap me.  But I couldn't help it.....mmmmm..... yummm....

We like the rustic charm of the interior.  We were curious why there was so much space and so few tables.  Apparently, there is a business ordinance the dictates the number of tables based on the number of \"wash\" rooms.  They have one wash room.  So, although there is space for more tables, they can't add any more.  Of course, the owners plan to expand and they are hoping to open a microbrewery in the basement by Fall 2012.  I am sure this business will be around for a long time."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to have a girls night out and picked Smoke. This review will have 2 parts. Food, and management aspects.

First the food. During our insane wait in the packed but small waiting area, one of the diners came out and offered us (the waiting public- now friends because we had bonded) her bag of chips. Most of us were 1-2 drinks in and were ready to eat our coats, so we snagged the chips. The magical, incredible chips. When we were seated we had another cocktail. These drinks are fantastic and incredibly mixed using flavors such as lavender, blackberry and cucumber. The queso- unique and divine. The tacos? Ridiculously fresh and fabulous. We had a beef and a chicken and I can't pick which was better because they were both incredible. The mac&cheese was so rich and delicious but we were both too stuffed to eat much of it. So for food and drinks Smoke scores at the absolute top.

If the operations at Smoke ran smoothly they would be overrun with patrons and they would have to open other locations because they are that good. That being said, here is my perception of our visit. First, the piece of paper on the door that says SMOKE was not visible from the street, so we drove past it 4 times. Here's the deal- there are too few people working and when they come back from the employee area (which should be used for seating-seriously) they are inefficient. 2 girls were trying to deal with an inefficient seating system, juggling phones, getting drinks, wiping tables, taking names, and dealing with people checking on where they were on the list. We were seated after about an hour, but according to the text system we weren't supposed to be seated until 7 minutes before we left. It's a hot mess. So call before you get there to put your name in. Call when you are parking. Call when you are walking in the door. Then enjoy some awesome drinks and food!"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of BBQ foods, however my fiance and I were hungry and close by. 

The service was great, the environment was very cool, and oh my gosh was the food amazing! We absolutely loved this place! We definitely recommend it !!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. My main problems with this place is the atmosphere and the up-charges. $2 for a drink refill? C'mon..."}
{"text":"With cash in hand, we finally made it out to Smoke. When we popped in around 8pm, the wait was around 20-30 minutes which wasn't bad as there were quite a few people who came in after and their wait was about an hour and some. Due to Smoke's low number of tables, we shared with another couple.

For starters, we ordered the mac n cheese and cole slaw. I like a little heat so the cole slaw was delicious with the jalapenos; and the mac n cheese had some strong flavors though the sauce appeared a bit more liquidity than one would think but we ate all of it cause it tasted yummy. Then I had a veggie and chorico taco. The veggie like the slaw had a kick which was my favorite. The chorizo did not have much flavor to me. I also tried to order a agua fresco but they were out so ordered a lemonade which was quite satisfying. The horchata was wonderful too. The staff were incredibly friendly and the prices reasonable so we will be back here with beer since its BYOB."}
{"text":"I'm usually not a big fan of tacos but this place surprised me. There's no observable sign outside of the restaurant. It's next to Row House Cinema and ATLAS (where you can buy drinks to go with your taco).  We ordered BLT taco, brisket taco, ribs taco, and Mac&Cheese. All three tacos were awesome. I also love the decor of the restaurant, the fact that they are BYOB, and the good service. But the downside is that it's cash only and you probably need to expect at least 20-min wait for dinner."}
{"text":"We did call ahead seating and when we arrived they said it would be about a 45 minute wait. We went to another bar to grab a drink because the bar at Smoke BBQ was for seating/dining only and included a wait.  They texted us when our table was ready which was really nice. 

The atmosphere was pretty cool, I think they could probably add a few more tables to help cut down on the wait. The food depends on what you order. The brisket taco was delicious, the pork was pretty good and the BLT wasn't great. The tacos were pricey so we all ordered two and then ordered queso for the table.  The fried tortilla/pita chips that came with the queso were really good but the queso was more watery/wet than I have ever seen.

Overall, the food was pretty good but for the price, I would not go back."}
{"text":"Amazing Mac and cheese! Yummy homemade lemonade! Homemade pickles! Ugh so good. The atmosphere is great but can be a little crowded, its best to go during the week. Every time I drive by on a weekend it is a mad house!"}
{"text":"Hands down best food,drinks and service!

We had the chicken&apple taco OMG

The mac and cheese(more please)

Service (WOW)

Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best brisket taco I've ever had. Side dishes are wonderful. Don't miss Burger Tuesdays. Wagyu and brisket blend burgers with homemade ketchup, pickles and brioche bun. Hidden gem in Pittsburgh culinary scene."}
{"text":"SMOKE is possibly the best restaurant I've indulged in!!! The Chicken Apple taco is absolutely the best thing I've ever put in my mouth!! The Mac n Cheese is made with mascarpone and although its not comparable to your momma's Mac and Cheese, it's definitely in a class of its own. The atmosphere is eclectic and there's a nice energy every time you come in. The staff is wonderful and the owners are friendly and take the time to learn your name! This place has been added to my Pittsburgh Gems list!! Love it!"}
{"text":"When I moved to Pittsburgh from Austin, my one big grip with this city was my inability to get a good Taco. Once Smoke announced they were (re?) opening, many friends suggested that it would be an exciting place to satisfy my cravings.

It wasn't.

Smoke is more of a BBQ joint than it is a taco joint. Think Union Pig & Chicken. The thing is, they give you tortillas. Flour tortillas, and only flour tortillas. Oh, and you want totopos (tortilla chips)? Well, those only come in flour, too. Bleh.

Maybe I was just disappointed because everybody set my expectations incorrectly. But, even with that, the food didn't terribly impress me, and I'd rather go to UP&C for bbq comfort food cravings."}
{"text":"\"Spiced\" up my dinner. Every menu item I tried added a little spice to mix it up. A Pepper Lemonade (with vodka), a chicken Apple taco with jalapeño mayo, jalapeño Apple slaw, etc. Fresh food, great service and a very friendly staff made for an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"I'm always glad to have another dining option within a couple blocks of my house, so I was happy when Smoke made the move to Butler Street. It was good, but I think I may have been a liiiiittle let down after hearing all of the hype ever since it opened.

They did a great job with the space. It's very warm and cozy, with tons of wood and industrial finishes. It fits right in along Rowhouse/Atlas Bottle Works/etc.

My friend and I started with the queso, which had a great flavor with smoked poblanos and onions. It's served with fresh flour tortilla chips, of which my friend and I had quite different opinions. I enjoyed the salty, puffy chips, while she felt they were far too greasy and had trouble eating more than a few. I didn't mind this and actually took the remaining chips/queso home. The leftovers held up well on the second day.

I tried two tacos: the ribs and the chicken. The ribs came with pickles, onions, and barbecue sauce. I wasn't blown away by the meat--it was good, but didn't really stand out from similar tacos I have had in the past. $6.25 for a single, normal-sized taco feels a little steep if it doesn't completely blow you away. The chicken was topped with pickled onions, hot sauce, and an avocado cream. I liked the combination of the spicy sauce with the creamy avocado, but again, it was pretty average.

I hate to complain about this, but the cash-only thing... I understand it as a cost-saving measure, maybe in the case of a really tiny operation trying to reduce overhead, etc. But this is a full service restaurant in 2016, and while the items on the menu aren't terribly expensive individually, you will spend just as much here on a full meal as most any other comparable restaurant. It's not the end of the world by any means (and, if you forget to plan ahead, there is a PNC literally 100 feet away), but just an annoyance."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch for the first time. Bartender suggested the chicken Apple taco and a side of potato salad which was excellent. I'll be back. Friendly staff. Quick service."}
{"text":"Smoke is a great little place that has a super friendly staff and the food is delicious! Had the chicken and waffle taco today with jalapeño syrup....oh man. Tried my friend's brisket cornbread...another oh man. The waitress was also very sweet to check on whether or not they had mimosas. Turns out they had a bottle of champagne on hand (don't know if they normally do) and got a hefty serving of one. That was a double thumbs up. 

The only missing star is for the lack of menu. I wish they had more menu items! The word on the street is that they serve other things than tacos on the weekdays because they have to give their smoker a break. Aw man, you gotta be making those chicken and waffle tacos e'r-day. Would like to try a couple drinks next time!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOD GET HERE IF YOUR A FOODIE!!! Doesn't matter if your not a hipster it's a nice Atmosphere  was friendly casual! You can dress nice. Also they got a huge smoker like to smoke the foods all day long low and slow. I watched them in the kitchen due to it being an open kitchen it was a pretty neat site. The smoker is nice they say it contains rotating racks for everything. Our food was awhile but that's due to the freshness. They got flavored water drinks that they let me sample! All made from scratch too. The chorizo if you like spicy food I recommend it. It's real nice and tender they do Sautee it just till it done. Mine was not over cooked which is good. Also l, the flavored watermelon was nice and very refreshing. Espicially on a hot day after a bike ride. The lemonade was not too lemony not too sugary either they found an awesome balance! Next, holy mac and cheese was huge, it was enough for us three. It had mascara one and sharp cheddar. The sharp cheese gave it a nice bite and it a nice beautiful crunch. Now let me start on the chorizo, very flavorful great combo of ingredients very spicy I say like a 6 or 7 on a 1-10 spicy scale. But l was still able to thoroughly enjoy it came with pinto beans think tomatoes onion, it was a nice size taco too! It had awesom le stuffed fried nuggets as a bonus this a delightful restaurunt to go to yes it's far for me but  that's how much I love it and wana go back to it so bad! Overall, very amazed at this place oh everything is from scratch!"}
{"text":"I've heard SUCH good things about Smoke, so it's been on my list for a while to visit. Needless to say I was less than impressed with the place. 

Previously, Smoke was on the NoWait App which is awesome. It's a great app and makes the waiting far better than just going in and putting your name in. Well, Smoke doesn't offer NoWait anymore. So I drove down and put my name in, well little did I know that they DO still have call-ahead. So while there wasn't that many people in the restaurant it was still an hour minimum wait. When I asked if we can grab drinks at the bar, I was also told that they seat at the bar so that was out of the question as well. To say it was annoying is being polite. I put my name in, and went next door to grab drinks. 

Over an hour later, I still did not get any text that the table was ready. So we went back to the hostess that said there was 5 more people ahead of me, AFTER AN HOUR. But that they could seat us at the bar... which while on a date, was the whole reason why we waited over an hour for a table. 

Once we did get seated, at the bar, the bartender was great. After you get seated, service is pretty great. The ambiance is very industrial but very chic. I was impressed with both. 

Now the food. I ordered the queso and chips and the apple chicken taco. The queso was delicious but the taco left a lot to be desired. To begin with, it was SO spicy. Like had to drink a few gulps of water after each bite spicy. While I do enjoy a good kick, I just couldn't finish the taco. 

I feel like Smoke has a great potential to be a good restaurant, but first impressions do leave a lot to be desired at this place."}
{"text":"Smoke was one of the first restaurants I checked out when I moved to Lawrenceville last year, and it remains one of my favorites. You feel the classic Lawrenceville vibe as soon as you walk in the door: rustic, hipster, and a few contemporary touches. On any given night you'll find this hotspot packed with both locals and tourists.

Word to the wise: call ahead. They do not take reservations, but will take your name down if you are on your way. You'll be able to cut a good chunk of time off your wait by doing this. Smoke is rather small and even on weeknights your wait can be 45 minutes to an hour at peak dinner times.

The menu is concise yet well-rounded, which I appreciate. This is a restaurant where you'll discover your favorite items and want to get the same ones every time you come. For me, it's the chips and queso as an appetizer and the chicken apple bacon taco as an entree. The chips are made in-house and are kind of like a pita/tortilla hybrid. The queso is rich and sharp. The chicken apple bacon taco is one of their most popular, with good reason. I've tried other tacos here and always come back to this one. The apples provide a sweetness that contrasts perfectly with the saltiness of the chicken and bacon. The sauce has a zing to it but is not too spicy. Pair this duo with a delicious agua fresca (flavored water made fresh daily), and you've got yourself quite a delicious meal.

Unfortunately I find no choice but to deduct a star for inconsistency. I've been to Smoke probably ten times or so, and I find that wait times for food vary immensely. Just a couple weeks ago my friends and I ordered chips and queso and it was brought out in under five minutes. Today, however, we waited almost 35 minutes for our queso to come out of the kitchen (on a Monday, no less). We were only told that things were \"backed up back there\" and that it would \"hopefully be out soon.\" I understand that Smoke does a lot of take-out orders and that it's a bit unpredictable for them. However, the inconsistency in food preparation times makes it almost impossible for you to plan an evening around dinner here. If you come and you're in a rush, you may be disappointed. Despite the inconsistency, I'm always willing to wait for one of these tacos."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for months, and finally made it the whole way over the Waterfront over the weekend.  I was not disappointed, thought in all honesty I was expecting more.


Smoke's menu is meat-forward, and includes most of the items you'd expect to find in a BBQ joint...in a taco.  The meat is most & flavorful, and has most definitely been smoked.  

I think my rub with this place is that they rely on the meat too much, and don't try to dress up the tacos much at all.  I feel like they should stick with the BBQ theme and dress the tacos as such, or go the \"gourmet\" taco theme, and do some really good pairings with their toppings.  They do neither, and that fell a bit flat for me, considering there competition in Pittsburgh.  

I tried pork, brisket, & vegetarian + chicken tacos.  The pork was far & away the best; it had that slight crunch that a good carnitas should have.  The brisket was good  but needed jazzed up a bit more, and the vegetarian/chicken was mostly beans & corn with some chicken on top.  

If the tacos were $3 each, I'd like this place a lot more.  For $4-$6, I think they're too expensive for what you get...layer the flavors like they do at Round Corner or Yo Ritas, or drop the price down to a range that makes them a good value for the money.  

I will go back & try it again; we were there closer to closing time.  The owner is super friendly and I hope this place does really well, I just think they need to tweak their menu a bit more, as in theory I love the concept."}
{"text":"Oh yeah, I like it here! I was surprised how small it was inside, but quickly got a seat at the 'bar'. Our server was very friendly and cranked up Johnny Cash.

The menu is a la carte and each taco is about $3-5. I decided to go with 3 tacos and the macaroni and cheese. Trust me, this was a lot of food! I had a hard time eating it all and shared the mac'n cheese with Mr. J. 

I had the veggie, chorizo, and brisket tacos. I'm still debating which one I liked best...but I'm leaning towards brisket! The veggie was loaded with fresh, fire-roasted veggies, corn, black beans, diced crispy potatoes, and a chili de arbol sauce. Fantastic! The chorizo had ground chorizo, pinto beans, crispy potatoes, and some other goodies I can't remember, LOL. The brisket taco had thinly sliced brisket, onions, hot peppers, and a mustard bbq sauce. 

The macaroni and cheese was also a surprise with roasted garlic, marscapone cheese, and sharp white cheddar cheese. It was very good - creamy with a little bit of a sharp kick. As I type this review, I wish I could have one of the tacos and mac'n cheese in front of me right now. 

The agua fresca is a must-try; but Smoke is BYOB and this meal would have been even more killer with an ice cold Landshark with lime. 

Why are you still reading this? GO NOW!"}
{"text":"Wow.  I had a great lunch today at Smoke and left with a big smile on my face.  I loved the pork taco with caramelized onions that seemed slow cooked and melded perfectly with the tender pulled pork.  Like all the tacos, it was served with lime juice and cilantro.  Also had a breakfast taco with housemade chorizo.  In short, these tacos are (expletive deleted) delicious.  Also tried the macaroni cheese which contains scallions and mascarpone.  It was also above average but a tad too salty.  My guest also enjoyed the veggie tacos and Apple jalapeno slaw which was lovely.  Good service was appreciated.  After reading several other reviews, I was worried about the wait but our food arrived in a perfectly feasible ten minutes.  Granted, it was between meals around 3 o'clock and we were the only patrons.  Once they make updates to a second restroom, they plan to expand downstairs with more tables.  Highly recommended for dine in or takeout.  Go for the pork tacos, stay for the rest of the very small menu."}
{"text":"Back when this restaurant was in it's previous location, I probably would have given it 4 stars.  We just recently went back to Pittsburgh and wanted to try this in their new location.  First thing I would have to mention is the prices seem way higher than before.  I could be wrong but I don't feel the food justifies the cost.  The burnt ends taco tasted great but it was not worth $7.  Their pork taco was not even what I remember and not that great.  The queso is not what I remember and also seems a lot more expensive.  The fact that they don't take credit cards when a meal for two can easily be over $50 is ridiculous.  Brought $40 thinking that would be enough, I was wrong.  Consistency is important and they even struggled with that in their previous location."}
{"text":"Why would you have at the top of your website \"NO RESERVATIONS\" and then when we show up ask if we called ahead and then tell us it will literally be a three hour wait to get in? Oh I didn't call to get on the list? Why the hell would I think there was a list your site straight up said no reservations so why would I bother to call? 

Lawrenceville sucks now anyhow."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious. I've been going to this place since they started out in Homestead. Quality of smoked meat is spot on. One of my fave restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"I ate here with my friends for dinner on a Sunday. My friend first told me about Smoke after I said I was disappointed with another restaurant's mac and cheese (which was a few weeks ago). Oooooeeeeee (you can tell I'm excited by this place) the mac and cheese was delightful. They call it a \"side\" on the menu, but the portion was generous and certainly \"shareable.\" The tacos were very big as well. They are served wrapped in foil which helps keep them warm. I got the pork taco with had delicious apricot habanero sauce. I really enjoyed the juxtaposition of the sweet and salty/spicy/savory. My friends were big fans of the chicken apple, BLT and brisket tacos. We got the chips and quest as well, the sauce is yummy without being too heavy and the chips were how all chips should be..

The restaurant is known as hipster and it felt very trendy.. like we were eating in NYC. While the interior is 'rustic' it was classy, clean and aesthetically pleasing. They have their own spin on things.. like instead of the stereotypical milk bottle water decanter, it was an etched vase like decanter with matching glasses. They have marquee lights on the brick walls and other cute knickknacks.

Cash only, doesn't seem to be BYOB anymore. Will be coming here again and again!!!! #ilovemacandcheese"}
{"text":"I think I could've read a Russian novel in the time between when I placed my order and received my food. Seriously, that was a crazy long wait to get the food. We're talking about a few tacos, it really shouldn't take that long. And, our seating area was drafty. Plus the music was too loud. And for what you get, it's a bit pricey.

However, the tacos are quite tasty. Three of the four of them were very good (the chorizo was so-so). The pork was indeed smoky; the chicken was appealing too. If they could improve their operation in the other areas, they'd be a four star place."}
{"text":"First sign of a good restaurant: I wanted everything on the menu because it looked so good!

Second sing of a good restaurant: Everything on the menu actually turns out to be great!

Look closely for this place, because in the dark, you can easily pass it by.  It's totally adorable inside, and come to find out it's actually registered a historic landmark.  Makes it even quirkier!  

The owner is super friendly and helped us pick out some awesome menu choices, being our first time there.  As soon as she said she had just cooked the ribs, for the rib taco's, I was in BBQ heaven!  I also chose the brisket taco, from reading all the other reviews, it seemed like the smart thing to do.  Both were incredibly tasty, with the fantastic BBQ marinade.  I was more into the rib taco than the brisket, but both were awesome.  

I was also torn by the sides, because they all looked so yummy!  I decided to get the Jalapeno Apple Coleslaw. I love coleslaw, but it's one of those sides you can very often get wrong.  Too much mayo, not enough mayo, not enough vinegar, too much vinegar, etc.  This was perfectly marinated with a touch of vinegar and mayo and delicious apple slices mixed in.  I also sampled my friends white cheddar mac n' cheese.  WOW.  Obvious next time side item for me, it's incredible!  

A couple things to remember:  It's BYOB, so bring it!  CASH ONLY. 

Also, they're only open until 7pm mon-wed, so make sure you're in before then.  She was nice enough to serve us and not kick us out...and was very nice all the while.  She even brought a sample of this delish cantaloupe drink, get that too on your trip out, because you must stop in!"}
{"text":"Yay for Smoke finally opening up again! Or maybe what I should really say is, yay, I finally visited the new location. You guys, it's beautiful. All decked out in warm wood, with that same smoke smell, and decorated in a homey way.

I went with one of my old standby's since it had been so long, the rib taco and the special mani mani taco. Both were excellent, the rib being just as tasty as before. Speaking of just as tasty, so was the white cheddar Mac n' cheese, which should be a must for anyone visiting!

I was surprised there weren't more new additions to the menu, but the one new side dish, the broccolini with corn and a layer of breadcrumbs was incredible! Seriously, I'm still thinking about it! 

I'm a fan of BYOB joints, which it is right now, but the bar they do have set-up seems to be screaming for some fresh margaritas. Right now you can settle for their special mix, you just bring the tequila... And the party!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh! The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is unique and thoughtful! My go to's are the blt taco+brisket, the migas taco+bacon, pork taco+hot peppers! The mac and cheese, and broccolini are out of this world! And don't forget about the chips and queso. Their hot sauce is homemade and i always order a side to smother on everything! Fantastic bar menu as well with really great craft cocktails, they change them often and I like that they keep things fresh. They always have an awesome beer selection too, no domestics but that's no problem. Overall I could eat this food everyday and still want more. Always worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Simply outstanding. I had one rib and one pork taco with a helping of mac 'n cheese. The rib taco was fantastic with just enough smoke flavor and heat. The pork was tender and delicious, but comes without the pickle dressing which really enhanced the rib taco. The mac 'n cheese was as good as I've tasted anywhere. This isn't a fast food place and the tacos are made to order. All smoking is done in the kitchen. A real treat and a surprise to find in Homestead! If I lived in Pgh I'd be here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"I love this place. When it first opened, the service was spotty but it was great during my most recent visit last weekend. I got the pork tacos and the mac & cheese with brisket and I was very pleased with both choices. It would have been a feat to finish the mac and cheese on my own but it would have been worth ordering even if I could only finish a few bites.

I can't wait for the new location in Lawrenceville!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. Their food is exceptional and their drinks are very good. 

They don't take reservations and it's kind of small inside. It can also tend to be loud in the same way that a lot of newer restaurants are that embrace the reclaimed aesthetic. 

I wouldn't take a large party here but 4-5 would be perfect - just prepare for a wait. 

You must get the burnt ends and a donut, if you're there for brunch. 

Can't say enough good things about this place. Please go!"}
{"text":"Their Chips+Queso are on point. Every. Single. Time. Pace yourself because it can end up being your one and only meal -- been there done that. The Migas taco is another fan favorite. The Smoked Salmon special is...not so special. Everything else? All day, err day."}
{"text":"Smoke is different... No Credit cards, no alcohol, very small (6 tables), very limited menu 5, and located in Homestead (aka on on island). The only way to end up here is to go out of your way to do so which is why Smoke works so hard to deliver when you do there. 

I would classify Smoke as a small plate restaurant serving specialized taco's (BLT, Ribs, Apple Bacon), a few well made side dishes (mac & cheese, Apple Slaw), and super fresh drinks like Aqua Fresca and Horchata. The wait was 25 minutes which was fine, the service was friendly, and everything we ordered was delicious.

Is the best tacos in town? No, but it is on the top ten list and is definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"hipster hell!!!! horrible obscure music, skinny jeans everywhere, crappy food, and no heat!!!! servers had disgusting nose piercings. only go to this place if you love participation trophies and bernie sanders"}
{"text":"Overall Impression:
Plenty of personality to catch your interest and make you return to taste more---just make sure you have the time and the cash (yes actual dollar bills) to make it to this popular Lawrenceville spot. 

The Food:
Ordered pickup to take back to the office. I ordered the Chicken Taco and I split the house queso with my coworkers. The Chicken taco had the meat, avocado cream, pickled onions, and cilantro. I expected for $6 to have more topping options, so I added mushrooms myself for an extra $1.50. Even with the expensive extra toppings and cream, the taco was VERY onion-y. It overwhelmed any other flavor the taco could have had, because I didn't taste anything else. So I couldn't tell if the meat itself was bland, or if the onions ruined the other flavors. I've seen both complaints on this thread. They also warned me it was spicy, but it didn't taste spicy.The house queso was filled with awesome additions like avocado pieces, chicken, and hot sauce--but the cheese itself was watery and bland. It's probably personal preference, but I expect queso to be thicker and a bit spicy, and theirs was neither. It did come with some really awesome pita chips, though. They were seasoned well and the perfect amount of crunch.

**If you're ordering for lunch, you only need one taco. You'll THINK you need two. But don't listen to yourself--you only need one. You'll thank me later.** 

The Restaurant:
You can smell the restaurant from outside on the street, but you wouldn't know it's them--their entrance is relatively difficult to find, and very easy to miss in the dark. You would think they're a speakeasy! The only definitive mark on their door is a medium-sized \"S\" with their name printed very small on the door with the restaurant's hours. I suggest they invest in a chalkboard to put on the sidewalk (or something). 

Inside is intimate, warm, and full of character. At the front is a wall of freshly chopped wood (and who doesn't LOVE that smell?!) and it immediately puts you in a BBQ \"mode.\" The branding of this place is amazing, honestly. The girls at the bar were pleasant when we picked up our order. The \"cash only\" bit will always be an annoyance to anyone under the age of 35, the price tag will be enough to grind some people's gears, and the fact that you need to put be on their NoWait App in person and THEN wait two hours to be seated will make some people just walk....but if you can get past those three things you might be good. I will be trying their food again, but it didn't have the tastes I expected the first time around.

TL;DR:
This place walks the walk but they need to talk the talk. Their price tag (6-$7.50 PER taco) is high and the although I can tell the quality of ingredients is there and the place looks great, the flavor palette and portion size just doesn't match up.  Give it a couple tries, but if it ends up not being what you expect, I'd move on."}
{"text":"Overhyped for the price. Solid food and half decent service. I tried it out on a whim and it wasn't all that it was hyped to be. The best part of the place is the smell of the food cooking. If you enjoy the hipster beard crowd this is the place for you. Not bad but nothing that makes me want to go out of my way to revisit."}
{"text":"If anyone gives this less than 5 stars, you're a dick bag. The burnt end tacos and something everyone must experience. Beer selection is good, food was amazing. Seriously, try it."}
{"text":"Smoke makes the top of my list for restaurants in Pittsburgh. The Mac and cheese is to die for. And the apple and chicken taco is delicious. But above all, the queso and chips... Wow. The service is always kind and the atmosphere is relaxed and trendy. 

The switch from the byob policy to a full bar is the only reason it got less than 5 stars in my review. Although the new policy won't stop be from coming completely (nothing can keep me away from the queso), I loved being able to bring my own wine or fave beer to accompany my tacos."}
{"text":"Loved the breakfast-y egg and chorizo / egg and bacon combos I tried last Sunday. Also during the week just grabbed a brisket - holy cripes the mustard sauce will change your outlook on ... er, mustard. (I skeeve mustard, this I dug on, maybe because of the burn)

Place looks quite cool, very DIY 'I-made-my-own-unicycle-from-spare-parts' hipness on a budget look to it. Think it'd be great for a group jammy jam, or one on one with that special ultra hip lad or lass of your dreams.

Just remember it's BYOB - don't let that big bar on the left fool you like it did me. I walked up and ordered a Guinness without even looking for taps :-D - for that move, I think I earned myself half a moustache twirl and eye roll combo from the \"bartender\""}
{"text":"Great restaurant simple concept breakfast and lunch is great. I had the tacos chicken apple and the brisket. The coleslaw was good had a little spice to it too. The Mac an cheese was ok I thought it would have some spice to it but it was ok. All the food I had was something I would love to have again. Event though there are many places to go I would love to go back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They have some of the best gourmet tacos you will experience anywhere. If you go you have to try the Chicken Apple and the Rib taco's they are beyond amazing.

i only give it 4 stars because I feel it's expensive. 4-5 for one taco and they really aren't that big. I would probably need 3 of them to feel full but that would make for a $15 dollar lunch/dinner. Even though they are expensive they are ridiculously good. 

You have to try this place at least once because once you do you will be hooked. You might have to save your pennies to get a might meal out of it but man it is worth it."}
{"text":"I liked it. Really good tacos, good donuts. I went for dinner and brunch. The only problem with dinner on Saturday is that you will wait a very long time. We got there at 6pm, got seated at 8:15pm, food at 9pm. So we made sure for brunch we were there as soon as they opened."}
{"text":"Great food! Drinks are well put together and proportioned. Great Smokey smell hits you when you walk in. The atmosphere is nice and casual. The servers are very knowledgeable and nice too."}
{"text":"Loved it! I had the brisket and Chicken tacos, Awesome! The queso and chips too and loved it too. Good cocktails also. Fun place, good energy and music loud enough to fit the place. Cash only."}
{"text":"This place is so good. The mac and cheese is not to be missed (try adding pork to it). The brisket is my favorite taco. Also there's that bowl o' cheese....yep. 

Tip: You can call ahead and put your name on the list."}
{"text":"The tortillas were fresh and delicious.  They reminded me of the style and consistency of the local vendors in Arizona.  

I was fairly disappointed with the Frito Pie.  I would suggest an alternative appetizer if you are looking for one.  It just didn't taste like any part of it was unique, inspired, or really anything different than you could make at home better yourself.

The tacos were very good, but hit or miss.  We had a daily special taco with strawberries, chicken, and a balsamic reduction that tasted like 1/2 taco 1/2 crepe.  It was amazing!  The chorizo taco was missing something.  It wasn't juicy or very flavorful.  Maybe more salsa or some avocado/guac and cilantro/lime?  

I got the smoked pork taco with that amazingly fresh, red, and creamy hot sauce.  I LOVE good got sauce and this was excellent!  It packs a punch too (habanero, I think) so watch out.

I'm hopeful that this place will stick around and continue to improve.  I really like the concept and menu, and I hope they continue to thrive."}
