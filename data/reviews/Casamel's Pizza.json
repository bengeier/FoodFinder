{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! I LOVE THE FOOD AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!. I found the place from a friend that down the road. I started ordering while I am at work and now my entire company orders from them as well. I lived in downtown Cleveland and would drive there in weekends to get their food. I moved to North Ridgeville and now come back for their food. There is no other place Id rather eat.  I joke with them when I call and call myself a VIP and now they call me it as well! Makes me feel special but love the food and the delivery reps are awesome as well!! Kudos!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Even better wings (yum garlic Parmesan). Had to give it a 4 star based on prices. A little on the high end compared to other pizza places in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is great. I order take out and party spreads from here frequently. They are as consistent as you can get. One of the best in Cleveland. Try the Stromboli!!! Killer. Super clean and super friendly. Check it out you won't be sorry. That is unless you are from New York , in which case you should go back. Yankees suck."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you, as I have had people say that the name doesn't match with what I'm stating that I'm ordering. But I have to say, the pizza is absolutely delicious. It's better than any chain in the area, plus you're helping to support the local small business, so why not? Also, I have to say, the customer service is excellent. Every time that I've gone to this place, I've been greated by warm, smiling staff. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"You can always tell a good pizza place by the quality of their wings. While their wings aren't the meatiest I've had. The sauces sampled(Garlic Parm and Garlic Hot) were above average in my book. Plenty of sauce to dip and decently priced as well.
Pizza's pretty good, local mom and pop style, not too greasy, good on toppings, straightforward sauce, and good the next day as well."}
{"text":"Casamel's pizza is fresh and delicious! They always have groupons and coupons out there so you can usually score 2 medium pizzas for around $15.

The staff is always so friendly and the restaurant itself is impeccably clean. Definitely a great (NON-CHAIN!) pizza option for those in Parma/Old Brooklyn."}
{"text":"I normally really like the pizza, but I'm not sure about them after tonights order. $20 for a large 3 topping pizza SOAKED in grease?  No thanks. They did ask me if I wanted a new pizza & I accepted. What I received was an even greasier pizza in its place! I loved their pizza because it wasn't soaked in grease. I told the female manager that was my issue. Also, their $6 \"deluxe\" salad is all lettuce w/ a tiny sprinkle of toppings. I drove my 2nd pizza w/ salad & got my refund."}
{"text":"Just moved to town and got a large pep and sausage pizza with an order of fries. Pizza was delicious some of the best I've ever had in my life. Crinkle fries were really good as well. Can't wait to try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Just moved to this part of parma and keep hearing what great pizza . Being a large family w 5 kids and normal half a soccer team here , we normally choose the $5 cheap pizza in our area . However tonight I decided on taste over cost . I was truly excited to have a pizza that tasted great and looked edible. We ordered a sheet pizza aka kids pizza , their white pizza aka mom pizza , & wings . Wings were some of the best I have ever ate. Now my normal pizza bill ranges $40 ... tonight our bill was almost $80 . So this will be a treat not a normal pizza night . However might grab me a white pizza , while out picking up our normal $5 kid pizzas ."}
{"text":"It might be just me but it seems like the ingredients have changed or the recipe has been tweaked maybe? Ordered from them on Thursday and it was so good we had to repeat it on Friday. Doughy and delicious! First time ordering the ham and pineapple here which I'm normally not a huge fan of but I don't think I'll go back to any other!"}
{"text":"What a great local gem that delivers too!! I'm always wary of pizza places that aren't chains.  I'll find that the sauce is too sweet, or the dough is over/under cooked, or cost too much, or the cheese is waxy, or the mushrooms are canned... Just yuckie overall. This place though! Definitely a mouthwatering surprise. Ate the Deluxe and White BTO specialties. I obliterated my BTO in minutes, no shame. As for the Deluxe, oh my. What big sausage chunks you have ;)"}
{"text":"Okay so... Apart from the soggy pizza. The customer service was atrocious. I placed an order for 2 LG 1 topping pizzas. 1 sausage and 1 pepperoni. When bigot back home and dished the pizza out to my family my son kept complaining about the pepperoni pizza being terribly soggy. I had a similar complaint with my sausage pizza so I decided to try his. And it was awful. Completely soaked and nearly unedible. So I proceeded to call the place back to see if they could do something about my order. The manager was very rude and I had to go back with her about how the pepperoni and cheese makes the pizza soggy but how this wasn't my 1st pizza experience and this particular one was unsatisfactory. Eventually she replaced my pizza with aedium rather than the LG I originally had ordered. When I got to the place to pick it up the employees were snickering and talking rudely as I was exiting the restaurant. Will never go back again."}
{"text":"Consistently good non chain pizza place in Parma. Prices may seem a little high for a take out pizza place but so worth it. The sauce is good the ingredients are good and they are quick. In a world full of Pizza Huts, Marcos, Hungry Howies and Zeppies do your self a favor and try this delicious pizza."}
{"text":"I woke up feeling worse than I have felt in a very long time. Last night I was drinking at Prosperity and met a guy who was just released from Richland Correctional in Mansfield. He had DTA tattooed across his forearm. He explained this meant \"Don't Trust Anyone\", his personal mantra. He seemed to open up and trust me right off the bat. He bought us shots of gin and next thing I know he is getting belligerent, humping the bar and asked me if I had any crack. I should have never trusted this situation and denied the shots. I slept the entire day away and missed the Lion Dance at the Asian Festival. I still am bummed out about that. I needed some good, greasy pizza today. I wanted a place that I have not tried yet. I don't like any of the pizza in Tremont or in the immediate area so I figured the internet could find me something. I hopped in the car with Maddigan, the best norwich terrier ever, listened to Box of Rain, Ripple and a few other Grateful Dead classics and headed down 176 south to Parma. The pizza is typical mom and pop style, conveyor belt oven. Not much difference between this, Papa Nicks, Antonio's or Gepetto's. I enjoyed it and love to support local independently owned and operated places. I am having a party soon to celebrate quitting my job, (once I finalize getting the new job by being dehumanized and pissing in a cup) and am debating on getting a couple of sheet pizzas from here. It is good for the price."}
{"text":"I have a family member who lives around that area and who would always order this for us when she babysat us as kids!  Super good and I love that Parma has so many local pizza places that aren't chains.  In addition, many pizza joints have disappointing wings but theirs are great!! The garlic Parmesan wings are my favorite and are actually crispy!"}
{"text":"Had to stop mid-slice for a review. (Insert greedy pizza lover face) so I've been trying out different delivery pizza near my home and until now found NO PLACE I'd order from again. I don't even want to eat the other pizza when in a pizza emergency. This one has finally allowed me to rest."}
