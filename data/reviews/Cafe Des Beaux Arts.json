{"text":"Best French cuisine in a museum! I came here in 2009, so I don't know if the quality is still the same or not. The day before I went to a small French restaurant, but the quality is below this. I like the set meal with desert and cafe au lait. The price was very reasonable. The nice museum and satisfying lunch made my journey to Montreal in the wintry December worth it."}
{"text":"We had a very disappointing lunch and certainly, Montreal can do better.  At the height of the tourist season, between the fabulous Pompeii and Lautrec exhibitions, the Cafe should do much more to appeal to and entice visitors to our city, let alone regulars like me.   The Cafe isn't what it used to be be. No more  onion soup and there were only a few regional or seasonal specialties. The prices were exorbitant considering the offerings.  I ordered the soup de jour, a flavourless pur√©e of potato and vegetables. My main dish, an entree of gravlax was mediocre to say the least. 3 slices of toasted ficelle with the proverbial smear of flavoured mayo. Not enough ficelle to match the salmon, I ate the rest with the accompanying dinner roll. At $13 this was not worth the cost. To add insult to injury, my accompanying baby arugula greens were topped with a disgusting piece of mystery object (dried arugula?), something that should not escape a cautious chef's eye.  Lunch for 3 without wine, tip or coffee (we all ordered the appetizer plates and there was one other soup) was $83!   The only positive note was the service of our waitress. She was very attentive and professional. I did, however, note that there was a couple who stood for about 10 minutes before being greeted or seated by the hostess. They weren't happy either.  I think that the Cafe has many problems which should be sorted out quickly before it's too late."}
{"text":"We had a snack and a coffee after viewing the artwork on display.  The cafe in the museum is very nice. We ordered croque monsieurs to eat.  They were delicious. It's great that so many museums have quality cafes and restaurants inside them."}
{"text":"Standard museum cafe. Stylish and minimal, and predictably slightly overpriced. However, the wine we had (recommended by the friendly bartenderess) was great.  The cheese plate was pretty generous, and we had a really nice squash soup.   It's quite an elegant interior, but slap on a sleek black ensemble, and even if casual, you'll be fine. Nice dining experience in a beautiful museum."}
