{"text":"The people here are very nice. For vegan desserts they have a good selection but some desserts will not taste as good as their non-vegan counterparts. I quite enjoy their selection of smoothies and they have very good service. The staff is nice, they don't give attitude and have yet to mess up my order. This location is very cute and I definitely recommend it for just even your morning coffee"}
{"text":"Fast service, reasonably priced and delicious baked goods for those with food restrictions. This place is a godsend."}
{"text":"Came here on Valentine's Day. The highlight is definitely the ambiance and decoration. It doesn't disappoint from the photos online! Very cute details throughout. There are seating areas, but the wait wasn't too bad considering it was Valentine's Day. They will seat you, but you order your food at the counter. The food was delicious and pretty on the eyes. If you are looking for food that is filling, this isn't the place. But if you are looking for a light, guilt-free tasty/ healthy meal, this is the place! I would recommend everyone come here at least once. Will revisit again!"}
{"text":"This coffee shop locate at a superior street corner .The decoration and setting are very decent and any girl would like to visit if the have ever cross.However the atmosphere is not really friendly and attractive. Cake and cookie is fine, not very remarkable. Good place for girls' chat and gathering."}
{"text":"-The short version-  Vegan bakery/caf√© with a lovely atmosphere and fancy decor. A must-visit, at least once. Come for the desserts, not for lunch!   -The long version-  Atmosphere:  Lovely decor: vibrant pink, gold, whites and teals give the place a very ~fancy~ feel. The place gets crowded pretty quickly around lunch time and there is very limited seating, so come early during rush service or be prepared to wait.   Food and Drink:  A modest selection of coffee and tea as well as some smoothies. The prices are okay for such a high-end looking place. They are similar to Starbucks prices, so if anything, just go here instead if you want something more unique but for the same price. I got a regular Mint tea and jasmine tea for $3.40.  The menu has a small selection as well, on the expensive side. All items are gluten/soy/nut/sesame- and preservative-free. A vegan shop. They have lots of beautiful baked goods to choose from. You can order them to go, which is probably the reason for the long line I'm staring at. I got the avocado toast with salad and soup as well as a cracked chocolate powdered sugar cookie. They were both delicious: the salad and toast was on the small side, the cookie was was good and rich. They do dessert right. Don't come here if you're hungry. It's better for dessert.    Service: You need to go up to the counter to order even though you have a table. I get why though, there is not enough space for a waiter to be running around, so this is more efficient. They do bring you what you ordered, you just need to pay up front. The staff are very friendly and attentive.  Overall:  Great, high-end place for coffee/tea and dessert! I would recommend it, just not for lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent. There's a shortage of places I can go to find vegan donuts and I was happy to come across it.  The donut was moist, sweet and the raspberry flavor was fruity (not just sugar). I loved the \"wedding-like\" decor which gave it a sense of elegance.  Seating wasn't an issue since it was empty when we visited."}
{"text":"Free of Gluten,Soy,Sesame,Nuts,Preservative and Taste (?) Very nice and rich envoirnment in a small area in Yorkville.Lunch menu offers limited and simple menu but is not meant for people used to regular food. A great place for Gluten free and Vegan food lovers. I ordered a cheese sandwich- what a disaster. Could not swallow the first bite but probably a delicatessen dish for gluten free and Vegan lovers. Seeing that I was not happy caught in an awkward position, the Manager jumped to action. She was very understanding and offered a substitute at no charge. I was very pleasantly surprised with her offer and concern. Though I did not take her up on the offer, gesture of a good Manager was well noted. Service is o.k. ; pricing is Yorkville high; envoirnment is excellent. Quality cutlery."}
{"text":"The only great ?aspect of? this restaurant is the decor and ambiance?. Besides that, the food is overpriced and not the best. I had a hot chocolate which sadly to say was disappointing? because how can hot chocolate be bad? ?I also had the pizza which did not have much taste. This place is also quite small and squishy, you have to go up to the register to order so depending on where you sit, this can be quite uncomfortable."}
{"text":"The best thing about Sorelle and Co is the GORGEOUS decor and the \"worry free\" eating experience if you have a dietary restriction since everything is nut, gluten, soy etc free.   The food itself was alright. Liked the soy latte, carrot cake was average, and the vegetable panini was mediocre --it was really rich and rather bland. Price was really reasonable though, especially for a place that has such nice presentation.   Come to Sorelle and Co for coffee and dessert in a beautiful setting."}
{"text":"Arrived at Sorelle on a weekday afternoon to celebrate my good friend's birthday. Because of the recent promotional posts on social media, there was already a line (wait time for ~30 minutes) even on a weekday. I previously had one of Sorelle's chocolate cupcakes with raspberry frosting and knew I had to try it again.  Sorelle specializes in gluten free, sesame free, and preservative free desserts and hot foods. I got the vanilla cupcake with raspberry frosting and the grilled cheese with vegetables. The vanilla cupcake will not be as fluffy as a non-vegan cupcake but it is still delicious. With a light, creamy, and not too sweet frosting, the cupcake base was balanced. I cannot say the same for the red velvet however as there was just something about that cupcake which was off. The sugar pearls on them made them look fancy though! The lemon donut was dense and the glaze was sweet. Though my friend thought it was a little too dense, I thought it tasted great.  The grilled cheese with veggies was accompanied with a green salad. Tastes like normal grilled cheese with veggies without any animal products. Portions of the hot food are smaller than what you would expect. But the prices probably are accounting for the ingredients. One person was around ~$20 with tax and tips.  The ordering system at Sorelle is:  1) you check in for their waiting list  2) you get called when a seat is available 3) you order and pay first: desserts are given to you right at cash but other foods are served to you as you will be given a number.  Although Sorelle has a tight space to work with (I know they would definitely flourish with increased space), I believe they managed their space well. In addition, their ordering system is efficient and enhances the organization. The staff were nice and accommodating. They worked well with the stress that comes along with the lunch rush. Because Sorelle is so specialized in baked goods (gluten free, sesame free, preservative free, etc.), they must get a lot of questions about their products which I respect the employees take the time to handle.  TLDR: Want a nice snapchat or instagram post? Sorelle is the place to be!"}
{"text":"I got take out there.. a grilled cheese with the side salad. Once I got to eating my meal (which was about 6 minutes later), I noticed that the cheese in the grilled cheese wasn't fully melted, the bread was already soggy and they had forgotten to provide dressing for the salad. Overall, this was disappointing and underwhelming, especially considering the prices are decently high."}
{"text":"The decor of this place is like a girl's dream! The place was so beautifully decorated that most people took pictures while they were there.  I met with a friend here at around 3 pm on a rainy Friday, there wasn't much of a line and there were still empty seats when I got there. However, it did get pretty packed and the line started getting longer at it started getting later into the evening.  I ordered the blood orange cheesecake and a macchiato with soy milk. The food was just mediocre. But I get it, everything is vegan here, which explains why I personally would never go vegan. It was just lacking in a certain richness...  Overall, I would only come to this place for the ambience as the food is expensive and mediocre."}
{"text":"Sorelle specializes in, as I like to label it, \"everything free\" ... i.e. dairy free, soy free, nut/peanut free, sesame free, gluten free ... As someone with a sweet tooth with dietary restrictions, I previously drove up to Richmond Hill to buy baked goods to celebrate a friend's birthday.  I was excited when the new location in Yorkville opened as it is the perfect audience for this type of bake shoppe.  I have tried a few of the cupcakes and each time, while I am excited that I can eat them worry-free, the icing is delicious but the cake is stale.  As an icing lover, this is not a deal breaker so I would be willing to order more cupcakes.  Yesterday, I tried the Nanaimo Bar and it was amazing.  No dry or stale taste like the cupcakes.  The middle layer (traditionally the creamy custard) was perfectly sweet and creamy like the real thing.  I can't comment on the meals because I am a bit scared to wait in the line.  There are very few tables at the Yorkville location (I recall the Richmond Hill location had a floor of seating) so while the location is still new and exciting, I am not ready to brave it for a sit down meal.    While the price point for the baked goods is on the higher end, the portion size is huge.  You could comfortably split any of the baked goods or save some left overs for later.  All in all, the price point is what I would expect for the location and caliber of the baked goods.  This place might be worth skipping as a take away bakery if you have no dietary restrictions but a must try for someone with allergies/restrictions.  The box is also so beautiful so would make a great gift."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday afternoon. Really beautiful place situated in Yorkville. We were able to quickly find a table however, it can get super busy on weekends.  To eat, I ordered a blueberry scone and vanilla earl grey tea. The tea was amazing. However, as for the scone, it was very dry and had a powder like texture which made it very difficult to swallow. I told one of the workers that I didn't like it and they were very accommodating and allowed me to choose a different treat. I chose the spiced carrot cake which was much better.  However, It is on the expensive side. I paid roughly $10 for the scone and a cup of tea.  That being said, it's a very aesthetic place and a great place to visit if you have allergies (like myself). However, be careful what you order."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try Sorelle and Co since I saw it featured on a segment on Rogers TV so I was delighted when I came across the Yorkville location. The wait time was about 20 mins which was expected.  I tried the London Fog latte (it was my first time drinking london fog) and it tasted so dreamy! For a bite i grabbed the Cinnamon Sugar donut, it tasted like Cinnamon Toast crunch in a fluffy buttery pastry form. Staff members were super informative on the menu items and were very friendly. The price was extremely reasonable for the presentation and portions.  The decor was fit for a princess and the flowers/furniture were absolutely gorgeous. It felt like the tea party of your dreams.  Four stars instead of five because of the layout of the cafe. I found that when we were lining up we were in the staff members way when they were bussing tables and bringing the plates/cups to the kitchen, so it was awkward standing around when the staff was trying to dodge/swerve patrons.  Overall dining experience was great and I will definitely be returning or at least visit the Vaughan location!"}
{"text":"Elegance,chic,beautiful. Its a bit pricey but again, you are in Yorkville what do you expect. Everything is perfect about this place. I love ittttttt. And i would recommend this to everyone."}
{"text":"Gave this place a shot but ended up being a typical Yorkville show. One cupcake came to $6.20. Cupcake was dry, crumbly, devoid of flavor, and frosting was grainy.  2 stars for nice staff and pretty decor."}
{"text":"This place is all Looks.  The minute you walk in the decor is Beautiful, the desserts are well displayed & pretty, but there cakes is dry and plain & there's No Wow factor. The cookies are a hit and miss. For the look of this ritzy spot & prices you would think it's amazing?  Negative! Also the staff is very delayed when you ask them any questions about what they have or what it's made of, as if they are bothered. I spent $60 on a variety of different things, and geez how I regret it. I Would Not waste my money on this place again nor would I recommend anyone to as well!!! Lesson learned. Would not recommend Period.   The 2 stars is for Looks  :-/"}
{"text":"This is one of the cutest dessert places in the area. Although the decor, atmosphere and presentation are beyond expectations, the brownie was not as rich as we imagined it would be. The brownie was recommended to us by a staff member as one of the most popular tasty pastries but it wasn't that great.It is a cute meet up place though if you're looking for a place to have a cup of tea or smoothie with your friends for brunch."}
{"text":"I went to the Yorkville location recently after seeing this cafe on a number of blogs and through word of mouth. The storefront is beautiful and the interior design looks like it was made for Instagram. The aesthetics are gorgeous which is probably why there was a lineup to get a table (approximately 20 minutes). However, after trying their menu I probably won't be back. I appreciate the fact that it's vegan, gluten free, etc but at the end of the day the taste wasn't there. If you have dietary restrictions, I would give this place a try. If not, there are plenty of better options in the city."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the service. The hostess was very rude. She first told us that is is very difficult to seat parties of four and did not make it a welcoming environment. The staff at the desserts and coffee counter were all very nice though and the coffee and cakes were not bad. However the entire visit was spoiled by the hostess. As we were leaving she proceeded to talk to another colleague and ignored us when we said thank you. It is not a bad place but the environment felt almost racially uninviting or just uninviting."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with a friend the other day and liked it! It was a weekday at 6PM and not busy at all (apparently there have been lineups during weekends).  Pros: -Beautiful interior and comfortable seating -Friendly staff -Good food, all gluten-free & vegan. I tried the mushroom/parsnip soup (daily special) and the nanaimo bar. Soup was just ok, but the nanaimo bar was awesome - could not tell it was gluten or dairy free.  -Lemon and cucumber water free for customers   Cons -Pricey (although that's to be expected for 100% gluten free - always more expensive) -I asked about the ingredients for another of the soups and the staff wasn't sure. Since it's likely people with allergies come here it would be good if ingredient lists were available."}
{"text":"Cute cafe in Yorkville known for their vegan free and gluten free desserts. My friend and I stopped by to get something to drink after our shopping on Bloor Street. To our surprise they also serve very delicious smoothies. I got the Pom-berry for a dose of antioxidants. My friend got the Tropical Basil with orange juice. I tried her drink, it was so refreshing and different with the Basil in it, I wish I could get this every morning. When we left, they were getting ready to close and gave us free chocolate cookies to take home. How cute! Will be back to try other items in the future!"}
{"text":"I love many things about Sorelle! I first tried this location a few months ago in January and fell in love with this chic cafe right away. First, its location in Yorkville is great (right at an intersection) and its stylish white interior with touches of gold is so pretty! It looks so cute and classy - the perfect place to catch up over tea lattes and treats. Speaking of tea lattes, they have a variety of Sloane teas to make tea lattes with so that is already another bonus. Try the heavenly cream latte which is basically a creamy version of Earl Grey - what a treat!   Their baked goods are also known for being peanut free, gluten free, soy free, dairy free, etc. which is great for those with allergies and people who just want to try something different than other bakeries. They have different squares, cupcakes, pastries and cakes that you can pick from. I particularly liked the Nanaimo bar and carrot cake slice, which I got on my second visit here. I got the treats to go that time since I was in a rush and it surprisingly came in a sturdy box that had a nice floral design on it. Both treats tasted fresh and decadent without being overly sweet.   The only cons about this place are the limited seating and prices. If you come with a group of 3 or more to dine in, expect to wait a while in line. I remember my first visit here with 4 other friends was more than an hour wait. It ended up being worth it since we really wanted to try this place and we just happened to have time to spare that afternoon. The prices are also a bit ridiculous for some treats - I get that they're peanut free, gluten free, etc. but this place is more of a once in a while treat kind of place. If you keep that in mind when you come here, you'll enjoy it. Worth a visit at least once!"}
{"text":"What a CUTE place. Deserts are fabulous and the ambiance is great.We got the blueberry donut and the cheesecake and they were both delicious. Great place for tea and sweets. The savory meals looked pretty good as well but we didn't have the appetite to try it all. I'll definitely go back again"}
{"text":"Blueberry and orange donut 8.5/10 The glaze was too sweet for me, but the cake donut was spongy. The syrup from the blueberry jam gave the right amount of moisture."}
{"text":"As it was a quick grab and go, it'll only be the dessert and service rated not the ambience. Dessert that i had Strawberry mousse was too creamy for my liking. Tea was a -OK.  Will have to be back to give it a second go. But overall, the sweet treats are abit creamier than I expected."}
{"text":"Mediocre takeout experience..  A friend and I dropped by Sorelle and Co on Sunday afternoon to grab a snack to go. The place is packed and there's a crowd in the entrance because there are so many people waiting for tables (as expected, the place is gorgeous!), I definitely recommend coming on a weekday. We were immediately directed to the take out line which moves pretty fast considering how busy it was, however the staff were extremely unorganized. The soy mocha is my usual and is consistently good. My friend ordered the hot chocolate only to realize it tasted like powder and water with no milk content (even after they asked for her milk preference). We also ordered a loaf each, the spiced carrot loaf was very soft and flavourful, but the cinnamon loaf was so stale! It was dry, plain and so hard it was evident that the pastry had been sitting out far past its time! It's interiors make it a destination to check out (do it for the Insta haha), but don't expect the food to be great..."}
