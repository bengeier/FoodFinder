{"text":"Don't let the parking lot or shady-looking side door steer you away. Excellent burgers and a good \"down to earth\" environment.  Leave your suit (unless its a sweatsuit) and tie at home.  This is where the locals come to relax and unwind after their shift is over.   Would be a 5 if burgers included fries."}
{"text":"Rummy's is just about everything you want your local watering hole to be.  The bar is small, it has a pretty good (non-electronic jukebox), and friendly great service.  This bar boasts a pretty good collection of regulars (I'd consider myself to be a quasi-regular due to its proximity to my house), but can occasionally get pretty busy.  The bar food is very good for what it is I'd recommend both the Breakfast Burger and the Vintage Burger,along with the old school greasy fries with vinegar.   Drink prices vary.. they typically have some sort of happy hour for Indians games and there are other more seasonal specials posted.  They do have a great special on Tuesday nights which is BOGO burger night.  Thursday also features $1 tacos (just ok) and generous pitchers of Labatt for $5 (much better than the tacos).  All in all, you are likely to get some good service at Rummy's, have some good people watching, and probably jam out to some classic rock that spins on the jukebox.  It gets four stars not b/c any one thing is exceptional its just does everything you'd expect it to do very well."}
{"text":"If you love dives, this is your place! Cheap drinks, great music selection, small and cozy."}
{"text":"Love this place-everything you want in your cal divey bar! Service is personal and quick, and prices are very affordable. Food, when they have it, is pretty typical bar food- except for the chicken quesadilla, which is by far the best in town. Great people and stellar jukebox seal the deal for this place!"}
{"text":"I recently stopped into Rummy's for a last call drink on my way home from Twinsburg and was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness, clientele, and overall ambiance in this little place on Mayfield Rd.  I personally know that (3) of my friends are regulars here and have even complimented the food (sandwiches) that Rummy's serves up.  This night went without food, but trust me, I will be back and will absolutely try something from the grill after hearing all the good things on Saturday night.     I can't tell you how many times I've driven by but never stopped in as I'm sure most of you reading this review have done the same.  My recommendation to you is to go ahead and visit, try something to eat, this may end up being your new favorite dive bar.  Note:  I will update review once I try the food and spend more sober time here.  It was packed on Saturday so it was a little difficult to get the lay of the land.  GREAT LAST CALL BAR!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try some dive bars in the area and Rummy's was one of the stops.  Plenty of parking spaces.  Was pretty crowded for a Saturday night.  Patrons were friendly, but I got the sense that this is a regulars type place.  No waitresses, so you have to go to the bar to get service.  No biggie though.  2 well level cocktails= $7 so pretty cheap.  To upgrade to Ketel and Bombay was only a couple bucks more.  The seats are old and torn up.  Place definitely needs a facelift.  Played some bowling and had fun with that. Not a bad joint.  Would definitely visit again.  And definitely want to try the food.  It smelled great!"}
