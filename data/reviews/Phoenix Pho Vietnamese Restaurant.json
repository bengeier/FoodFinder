{"text":"The food is delicious. The service is great! They make it feel like you're a friend coming over for dinner. We love everyone there. In a normal week we are there 2 or 3 times. And since they recently expanded their menu, there are even more good things to try. You can't go wrong with the classics like the chicken pho or any of the different beef pho (my favorite is with the steak and brisket). But getting some of the other dishes usually turns out to be a great idea. My wife usually only get the chicken pho but she's been venturing out and enjoying her different choices. Spring rolls are a staple and the chopped pork with rice (C1 I beleive) is really good. Pour that fish sauce over the rice and go ahead and plant your face in it! Love this place and it's a bonus that it's so close! But I would travel for this one."}
{"text":"I, being a flight attendant, have eaten Pho all over the world, some has been good, some not so good, some being downright awful. This restaurant is excellent.  Clean, bright, friendly, the food I had was of exceptional quality and taste (Superbowl Pho and spring rolls)
The only downside was I wanted to eat it all at once. Big portions and very reasonably priced.  They have a new regular!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp pho + pina colada boba. The pho was amazing, with generous amount of shrimps (6pieces), and fresh veggies for that nice crispy texture. The broth was not salty and not too watered down which was perfect for me. And their boba was freshly made, none of that pre-packaged bs. What made this the cherry on top of all places, was the price! Inexpensive while maintaining its quality. Service was basic-- not a whole lot of conversing but my cup was never out of water and they did check up on me every now and then. Main deal here was the food relative to its low cost! 10/10 would come again."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night. First thing that caught my eye was a huge sign requesting customers pay in cash instead of card. Made me a little self conscious since I had a card... busy night and short staffed, makes for a not too good experience but overall it was just ok. Food was good, their was zero customer service. We ordered a boba drink which they didn't get to make because of the staff, there was none. Never was asked to refill my soda. We will try again just because of the convince of the location. But if the service is poor again we will not return."}
{"text":"It was so good that I went twice in one week. I took four different people with me and they all enjoyed it as well. I had the stir fry beef phô it was the best I've ever had. My sister had the chicken and put some jalapenos in it and it was delicious. We had the spring rolls in the fried egg rolls. The peanut sauce that comes with the spring roll is almost like a dessert it's so delicious. The second time I went I had the noodles beef and egg roll dish any can't go wrong. The two men that work there are very helpful, friendly, and provided great customer service. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I discovered this place wanting a new pho location.  The staff were nice and the place we clean.  The pho came in large portions and the broth was great.  I have 4 stars because I  felt rushed to choose what I wanted to eat."}
{"text":"So good great price it's a must try! Sort of in a hidden spot I guess you can say it's like a hidden gem haha"}
{"text":"It is a nice place with good rice noodle. I prefer the spicy beef rice noodle! And it's very cheap!"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend, menu is full of delicious looking Vietnamese food and the service was amazing. This place is absolutely PHOnomenal!"}
{"text":"This place is nothing but amazing and consistent. I can always count on the pho being amazing, fresh, piping hot and served with a smile. My usual order is egg rolls and the P10 + tendon. L-E-G-I-T. Best I've had in a long time! I'm here at least once every two weeks, winter OR summer. That's how good it is. I'm always happy to bring new people/family here because I know the food will be stellar and the value is beyond 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The spring roll was the worst I ever had the food was not good the employees were extremely friendly but couldn't stay off the phone him and another guy cat handling their phones it was extremely cold in there made it uncomfortable to sit there they never came by to ask me how my dinner was I would have told them the truth it was disgusting the place was extremely clean and the staff was friendly but I would never go back I wasted money on food that was not good there are too many photos of places out there that are wonderful I read the reviews thought it would be good but it wasn't I would have complain to the people if they ask but they were so nice so I just paid and walked out and went and had dinner somewhere else"}
{"text":"Terrible pho
Terrible customer service
Employees are incredibly rude and disrespectful
I would put zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"We had a delicious chicken Pho meal close to closing time on Sunday. There was plenty of tender white chicken and the broth had a very good flavor! Portions were large and the service was very friendly considering we arrived close to closing time...we will be sure to visit here again!"}
{"text":"The customer service here is great! Our waiter was awesome and funny! As for the food, very tasteful and traditional. Will definitely be returning for our pho cravings."}
{"text":"The chicken pho was very good and the place is very nice and clean.  Everyone was very friendly.  Pho Avina was my fave,  but this is right by my house which makes it a winner!"}
{"text":"Excellent food best little Pho place I've eaten in so far . Place is clean and well established definitely will be coming back again !!"}
{"text":"Some damn good pho. Friendly staff, and great taste. We had the vegetarian pho and pork egg rolls, they were great. Highly recommended. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I began to go here for pho and rolls because it was close to my house but I was disappointed by the service and the food was mediocre
Service was rude and flirting with customers seems like more of a priority"}
{"text":"I had to stop and try the Pho here. All the reviews were great and they lived up to the billing. The prices were great and the Pho was awesome. Lots of ingredients in my bowl making for a tasty and filling meal. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I've only had take out from here & the service was excellent. The pho was decent and so was the price. However, it's a little odd to be closed on Thursdays. I wished the hours were more regular (Monday-Saturday)."}
{"text":"Everything was so fresh and delicious !! The service was excellent as well . Highly recommend trying h1 if you're a seafood lover. We'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"This was an excellent find! The broth in the pho was excellent. I had the steak and meatball pho and K had the Bun. We shared spring rolls which were delicious and only $2.50. Great deal. 

The pho was lightly seasoned and pleasant with regard to the broth. I didn't feel like too much salt was used and although I prefer my pho spicy I would have definitely enjoyed the broth without adding anything. Noodles and meat was a good sized portion as was the bowl itself. For $6.50 it was a very good deal. 

K had the Bun and wow... The broth was about the most flavorful I've ever had. There is definitely a \"fish\" component to the broth that I thought was fantastic. People who don't like fish sauce may not like this dish/broth but I was blown away with the flavor. Little bit of a kick but nothing most couldn't handle. 

Add to that the \"mom and pop\" feel and a very friendly staff, 5 stars is an easy review."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and the staff is tons of fun. The restaurant is small and beautiful on the inside. Pho is one of my favorite foods and this place has my favorite broth, hands down. I am addicted to the pho ga and my husband loves the Bun Cha Gio Thit Nurong (B3). Both are delicious. We probably eat here at least once a week."}
{"text":"New restaurant in the area worth a visit. Clean dining room & restrooms, welcoming atmosphere, Delicious food. I will be back! Had the Pho Ga and thoroughly enjoyed every bite."}
{"text":"Terrific beef & brisket phô!  Very nice and clean restaurant, friendly staff....great Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"I found this place by mistake, I visit at least 2 times per weeks. The food is great and the customer service is awesome. I highly recommend for you eating pleasure."}
{"text":"Best Bun Bo Hue I've ever had in any restaurant! try the Pho Dac Biet too! Staff is all very friendly and the portions are amazing! Loooooove!"}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant a few times steadily the service and the food is gone worse until finally this last time we had to actually return food because it was no good it seem like they didn't really care but they did refund our money"}
{"text":"I go here pretty often and I've never had any issues. The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly. I always order the pho dac biet so I can't comment on their other entrees but it's reasonably priced for a large portion. They include a good portion of tripe , tendon and meatballs which is good. Nothing worse than a place that skimps!"}
{"text":"Fast, delicious and cheap! We all ordered the P1 and it was delicious! Added a bunch of spicy goodness and it completed the perfect Pho!"}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend there for his first Pho experience. He was a fan. The staff was so friendly the food was amazing and they were very accommodating to me as a vegetarian. The prices were great too. They prefer cash since they are a small business but take card. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm a lifelong pho lover being raised in Little Saigon, so I know a little about pho... 
I'm very sorry to have to write this. It's been two whole years we've been trying to force ourselves to like this restaurant simply because it is close to our home and convenient. We visited at least twice a month and are saddened tonight was the official deal breaker. 
Customer service: None. Not only does the same rude waiter never smile or express common courtesy, there are always employees sitting around on their laptops watching movies and ignoring customers! This evening our waiter brought me my soda chan (sparkling limeaid) after waiting 40 minutes and I was actually on my way out... finished with dinner! To make matters worst, I was charged for it. We received no water or soda refills and were finally offered a refill as we were leaving. Did I mention the waiter is rude? Another disappointment of mine from this evening was the automatic tax charge as custom with parties of 6... but this only means my baby who did not even eat was considered the sixth person! 
Quality of food: inconsistent, hard sticky noodles, extremely fatty flank, flavorless pho bo kho. 
Sorry Phoenix Pho, we tried, we really tried! Train your staff in customer service and get some quality noodles..."}
{"text":"Not a pho expert by any means, but this place is good.  Had the pho sate and it was yummy.  The server kept us laughing as well.  Can't complain about affordable food that's filling."}
{"text":"The Chicken Pho, is excelente, I was sick when I tried out out , it made me whole again.

This soup was so good.
I highly recommended, fresh leaves and veggies to toss in the soup. Mm mm mm"}
{"text":"After a long morning of shooting in the desert nothing beats a great bowl of chicken pho when you're famished...and they got it here.  Very unique. To me it's my next favorite in line from Pho Thuan Thanh in Mesa.
Hit it with my buddy and his daughter.  Order taken and my bud and his youngster get there food and mine wasn't served.  I just thought the chicken may be taking a bit longer.
I'm not a snobby person and I never send stuff back or get snippy when an order takes time and I didn't want to seem pushy asking where my food was.  I just figured the chicken was taking time that day.  Tables all around getting served and nobody noticed.  Not until by bud was just about done with his meal.  They came to the table and asked how everything was and then it was obvious I had no food.  To be fair I was offered a free bowl but I didn't want my friend to sit there and watch me eat when they were already done.  I was just hungry and wanted to get out of there to get some food.  Armando's to the rescue.
Like I said...it felt kinda cruddy seeing how we go there pretty much on a regular basis.
It'll be a while before I go back.  If ever.  But don't get me wrong.  That Pho Ga is killer.  And the upside was I got a free glass of water.
If I crave Pho Ga then it's Pho Thuan Thuan for me."}
{"text":"This amazing restaurant was very unexpected.  I was waiting on my stereo to be fixed and came over here to order lunch and get some work done.  The service is exceptional when you first walk in.  I ended up hanging out here a couple hours and they were so kind.  The shrimp Pho and shrimp spring rolls were to die for.  I will definitely be back.  My favorite Vietnamese restaurant for sure."}
{"text":"My wife took me here because she had a great culinary experience. She took me took me for dinner and everything about the menu is AWESOME and our server was lots of fun. Great sense of humor and knowledgable about what I should order on my first time. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some takeout because a special someone was feeling under the weather. Service was quick, restaurant was clean. My kids wanted to split a boba tea and the employee working the register was happy to do it while we were waiting. Our pho was packaged well and was still super hot when we got home. We will definitely be back when everyone is feeling well so we can dine in."}
{"text":"Good and great friendly neighborhood service. Place service good choice of Vietnamese food. I ordered duck mi noodle soup, pho supreme, and topped it off with a taro boba."}
{"text":"Staff is nice and cool as fuck.!food is always good. But damn I came up here tonight. I'm 2 weeks post ACL knee surgery. And i barley leave house. Well I leave to get bomb food and hobble to pho and they are closed. I'm here at 8:20pm and sign says they close at 9pm. Also online says close at 9pm. I go to open door and it's locked. All the customers inside eating having a good time but I'm outside like a jabroni. Smh. I came to spend my hard earned money to get some food and pho closed when they advertised opened. If you gonna post open until 9pm please stay open. Sometimes it's hard for a customer to leave house and get food. Case closed. Bottom line."}
{"text":"Best pho place in Phoenix !!Super clean and the staff is super friendly! I got the shrimp pho and it was delicious!! Also the egg rolls were super fresh and the best I've had in awhile! I recommended this place to everyone!!"}
{"text":"By far the best spring rolls and peanut sauce in Phoenix. Very reasonable pricing. You also get a punch card for a free app. if you pay cash for 6 meals.  The owners are very friendly .The place is very clean. By now I have tried almost everything on the menu at least once and never had a bad experience. They also do take out service. But watch out... they close at eight at night.  But totally worth it to come in and dine. The broth is very tasty. And they give you plenty of veggies."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, I had the shrimp bowl and my husband the chicken. I liked the broth for the shrimp but the chicken one was amazing. I think Next time I will go with that one. The fried rice was also very good. They have coke products which is always a plus and the restrooms were very clean. The bowls are huge and very delicious. I would recommend this place for anyone wanting some good Pho. This has become my new favorite place"}
{"text":"We ordered Togo.. and they gave us raw meat... so when we called the store with confusion the guy told us that the broth would cook the meat.. THE BROTH IS LUKE WARM HOW IS IT GOING TO COOK THE MEAT. and when we tried exposing the broth situation the guy said he didn't know what to tell us that the broth should cook the meat. We wanted to try this place because it was closer.. we will make the drive next time.. problem customer service and wasted money on raw meat. If I wanted to cook I would have made something at home."}
{"text":"Great pho and even better spring rolls because of their sweet peanut sauce! I can drink it all up! And the service is super friendly! Comfortable, clean and nice restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the best vegetarian pho in town! Lots of vegetables and the broth is very flavorful.  The ingredients are fresh and portions are huge. They have actually made a pho lover out of my husband. Their fried egg rolls are full of very well seasoned pork. They are a must. The vegetarian spring rolls are good, and their peanut sauce is on point. Don't miss out on this place!"}
{"text":"Phoenix Pho is my place.  The family goes at least once a week, the Pho is amazing and perfect. The Curry is the best curry I have ever had so rich and delicious.  Egg Rolls, Wontons and Asian Chicken Wings are perfect and even when I tell myself I am not going to get any, I cave the second I walk in. The family that owns the place are friendly and make you feel at home. Also the large screen TV is nice and makes it a great place to catch the game. I encourage you to go you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice decor, quiet, tasty broth! My son enjoys having Pho without any meat. They were nice to customize our order and charged us $6.50, a dollar off their meals with meat. The broth was nicely spiced and not too salty. The beansprouts and basil were fresh. They gave us a wedge of lemon instead of the usual lime in other restaurants.

We also ordered barbecue pork with rice and shredded beef. The barbecue pork was nicely marinated and quite tasty. The shredded beef was okay. The salad had a light dressing.

It was nice experience. Since it is on our commute, we will be back for more."}
{"text":"Great costumer service and great food. They did not bug you so much while eating and were very polite. Very fast and efficient. Will recommend!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD! 
The service are so great! Their Pho is so good! The restaurant is very clean and friendly environment! 
Must try this place! I will definitely come back here again. 

The spring rolls are so bomb! I love the peanut sauce that comes with it! Well done Phoenix' Pho! (:"}
{"text":"Omg so good. Got the pork and vermicelli. Spring rolls were delicious as well. I also had the avocado smoothie it was the best!!"}
{"text":"I move to the area about two months ago. Ive gone to at least 5 different Vietnamese restaurants, in search of the perfect peanut sauce. I found it here!! The spring rolls were great! The menus is small but the prices are the best I've seen. I had bun bo hue since that's what I've ordered everywhere else, so I can compare. I like that they had congealed pigs blood but the meat was dried. I was surprise they didn't do the pigs knuckle like most traditional dishes, the broth was spicy and flavorful without tasting too oily. I will try something else next time. I was so happy about the peanut sauce that I just ordered a few rounds of them. Service was great- which is not something you find at most Vietnamese places."}
{"text":"The menu here is not as extensive as in the more established places like Pho Thanh or Da Vang, but enough of the standard favorites are listed to make this a good destination for lovers of Vietnamese food. The food is tasty and very fresh with the requisite herbs and flavors. The restaurant itself is spacious and very clean and the staff members are very friendly and attentive. Note that the restaurant is in the inner corner of a small commercial square, so that it is not readily visible from the road."}
{"text":"I went there with my bf around 5:30 pm, we were in the mood for some pho and bon bo hue and decided to give this place a shot. The place is like 10 mins away from our house so we gave it shot. We got there and it wasn't so busy so we got seated right away. We were offered water and ordered our food right away. It didn't take long for us to get our meal. We ordered some egg rolls with nuc mam, bon bo hue and beef pho. The broth for both were very flavorful and warm."}
{"text":"Very good food and service. Food was fresh and delicious. Loved my Thai Tea. Next time I need to try the Pho. It looked amazing and my friend was very happy with it.  In addition, the restaurant is clean and tidy with nice decor."}
{"text":"Best food. And great service will go back again. Great atmosphere and good greetings at the door ."}
{"text":"The best pho without a doubt!
The best service and the best staff! Always friendly and nice! 
Try to come here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"The pho dac biet is delicious! For the amount of food they serve, it never fails to make me so full! The staff feels like family and are always very welcoming and sweet, will be a regular."}
{"text":"Randy, Arti and Ezel (spelling of her name is unsure) gave my husband and I great customer service. They were very helpful and humble. They made us feel very welcomed and we are going to come back again based on there friendliness and of course to eat this delicious food. My first time eating Vietnamese food and our first time here. I am so glad we came. Still thinking about how wonderful we were treated."}
{"text":"A really good place for a hot bowl of Pho....family friendly place... Not expensive at all....love this place"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Ordered door dash, no onion ...there was onion. Extra hoison and  sriracha ... only 1. Broth is not normal pho broth. More like generic beef broth. If you haven't had pho before you will  enable like it but as a regular pho person broth was very underrated. On a positive my brother spicy noodle soup he said was delicious."}
{"text":"Solid Vietnamese joint. They have a huge tv big enough for everyone to see from any angle. I love their taro bubba tea, Delish! Plenty of parking, a little farther out but worth it. I believe the place is family run and I can see how much effort each family member puts into their clientele, very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Service was good.  Guess other reviewers must have caught someone on a bad day.  Great variety of gluten free choices and the menu is clearly marked gluten free.  That's a good thing to see.  The pho is good.  I just need to ask for the rare meat on the side next time as it seems to cook quickly in the broth.  

It was nice that the server was knowledgeable about the gluten free options as that doesn't happen often enough for me.  

Overall good.  Very busy so come early or off prime dining hours."}
{"text":"I went to Phoenix Pho and it was a spacious restaurant compared to previous pho places I've been to. It was a clean place and the water tasted like water not tap. We ordered the egg-rolls. My sis absolutely loves the egg-rolls, she claims they're the best. I ordered the spicy beef noodle stew. The beef broth stew tasted really good but I hated the udon noodles they used. I was surprised when I saw it. Other than that, I enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"Very good pho just the tendon was a bit too soft but soup was excellent and it fit well with a wary traveler looking for clear soup with a kick to spice up a wary tummy as well."}
{"text":"So went to Phoenix Pho for the second time tonight. It was as good as the first time. I will be going back again soon. The food is great. Spice is VERY good. Place is clean and the service was top notch.
Go and enjoy yourself. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So far my favorite Pho in Phoenix! Service was great, food was amazing, prices were more than fair, the broth really makes it for me, and theirs has been my favorite of quite a many Phoenix Pho places I've been. I'll definitely be back when I'm on that side of town!"}
{"text":"Super delicious and a great atmosphere..the girl that waited on us was amazing and friendly and I wouldn't hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"I have eaten at a lot of pho places in Phoenix, and I would consider this place to be one of the better ones. The food and service we got were excellent. The staff were friendly, seated us quickly, and checked on us periodically to make sure we were doing fine throughout the meal. We started off with an order of spring rolls and egg rolls. The spring rolls were very good. Both the spring roll wrapper and the soup noodles' texture were perfect - some places make tough, chewy spring rolls, but not this one - and the flavors were right on. We each got a different variation of the beef pho - I had steak and my companion had the special one with steak, meatballs, tripe, etc. This soup is legit. The broth was really nice - a good amount of fat and seasonings, but not too over the top. If you like your broth crystal clear, this is not the bowl for you. Again, noodles were perfectly done and they give you plenty of them (along with everything else). Everything seemed to be very fresh and made with care. Don't be put off by the exterior (it's in the corner of a strip mall that has seen some better days)! It is actually very clean and tastefully decorated inside. It's a little far, but worth the bit of extra driving. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"The food here is good but not great. I wouldn't order the rice dishes because the taste is kind of unique. It's just not compatible with me."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is a gem. Outstanding food and service. The pork broth pho is unbelievable, makes me hungry just thinking about it. If you like good pho, you must try this spot. Good fresh ingredients made to perfection. The hot jasmine tea was the best I've had from any restaurant."}
{"text":"Loved the food! Jasmine tea, spring rolls. Please clean out the dining area and bathrooms."}
{"text":"Best Pho ive ever had. The Pho Dac Biet is so delicious.  The portions are great as well. My guilty pleasure food every week after a long day at work with my foodsidekick Cindy hahaha"}
{"text":"Food was awesome! The Pho is good and big portions. Finished our evening with some Vietnamese coffee."}
{"text":"There I was...looking for something different.  Tired of the same ol', same old.  I wanted something new. Then I saw it!  

The restaurant was well-organized and clean. It smelled of wonderful food.  I was greeted promptly and helped immediately with my to-go order in spite of only having one waiter for 10 different groups of people. I ordered the Pho (of course), gabbed a bit with the staff and was offered a nice seat and a cold glass of ice water.  I loved how the staff was attentive and proactively assessed my wants and needs.  

When I got home, my food was hot and fresh.  I had everything I needed to create my soup...my order had the Thai basil, lime, bean sprouts, onions, tripe, tendon, meatball, rare beef, Hoisin, Sriracha and the noodles were perfect.  Just talking about it (only 2 hours later) is making me hungry again!  

Here's one of the best parts...$7.50!  That's it.  Why not do something different?  Give this place a try.

I would and will go back to this super-clean, super-friendly, super-goooooooood tasting restaurant again and again.  Maybe even tonight."}
{"text":"We went here because my brother (in law) who is a born Vietnamese loves Pho and hast it 2-3 times a week. We were hooked, now my husband and I have it all least once a week. Broth is flavorful but not overpowering nor salty. I usually order (can not remember the name) but the spicy broth with peanuts (P9). It's exquisite. Little Saigon was also good but husband found their broth salty and is a bit pricier.
We go once a week, they knows our order by know."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this 1 star but the pho ga soup was 'bad', I was sick for 3 days & 2 nights.  It tasted unusually weird, the broth (yuck!).  I have no idea why people rated this restaurant with more than 3 stars unless they are use to consuming diarrhea, terrible-tasting broth soup.  The chicken and noodles were ok just not the liquid in the soup, it was so weird-tasting.  I've had less than better-tasting soups in other not-so-great pho restaurants.  It also had a yucky, brown-color chicken soup not clear as in this picture which had a strange smell too.  The shrimp rolls were amateurish, rolled a little loose."}
{"text":"My parents and I have been coming here for years. They like to try all the Pho places near their area. My mom is a picky eater and she only likes one kind of pho, the Bun Rieu. She will tolerate a seafood pho in a pinch though. We use to go to another place but they changed owners and the food started to decline and the prices started to go up. Phoenix Pho has the dish she likes and my dad always orders the flagship beef Pho dish, My mom will take a spoonful or two of broth from my dad to see how the broth is. She always gives a thumbs up. The staff in there always remembers what they order and is attentive. My friend went with us once and she ordered the Chicken Pho and it took a while to come but they updated her on the status and were apologetic. There was another reviewer that said the same thing about the Chicken Pho, I wonder if chicken is just not that popular and it really has to be made from scratch.   And for the area, it's the best price point we have found."}
{"text":"Not pricey, however, the pho isn't anything special to where they could mark up the price.
We were one of the three tables, not busy at all, yet didn't receive very good service. They seemed to be too busy watching the movie as well as working on their laptops. Didn't get my order correct and brought my hot tea after I had been eating for quite some time. They were very nice and polite other than the issues listed above; by reading the other reviews, might've just been a case of a lazy Sunday mood. Regardless, I was very disappointed.
Didn't enjoy the restaurant setup. 
First pho place I've been to since I moved here from Washington and I might just start making pho at home from now on.."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Only reason I dropped a star is that the owner is obsessed with people using cash instead of a card, even though it costs less than 3 cents on the dollar. All over the walls, and even on the receipt they changed Total to CASH for the amount you owe. Other than that, the food is incredible. Best Viet foodery I have been to, hands down. Just bring CASH. :-)"}
{"text":"The spicy beef noodles were really  good the taste is very traditional. They effort to have a clean and neat place all the time. The fresh rolls are the   I always have them all the time. I recommend this place if you want to have a really good pho."}
{"text":"Delicious and reasonably priced food.  I am a regular here and will not go anywhere else.  Great service and an excellent job to all involved."}
{"text":"Wanted to give them 5 stars but my chicken wings were freezer burned then deep fried. Everything else was absolutely delicious and I will most certainly be back. I'm always down to give a place a second chance!"}
{"text":"First time trying pho. They where great, and help explain everything to us. The pho was amazing. We will definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"Best authentic cuisine and nicest staff. Best in Phoenix. The Pho broth has a great flavor as it is made to order. The atmosphere is clean and inviting but fairly basic. Prices are very good as well. Always our first choice in Vietnamese cuisine."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating Vietnamese food with my step dad and I loved their chicken soup , it was delicious and I love how the noodles were so thin. I would definitely come back again !"}
{"text":"I had the egg noodle won ton soup. It was so good. The broth were delicious!! Noodle were cooked perfectly!!! My husband grilled pork n shrimp rice plate was amazing! We love the friendly service and will definitely drive back here for a good meal even we are going to move to Anthem soon."}
{"text":"Great food the ppl that work there are friendly .I ate there a few times never .. had a bad meal .I recommend it to friends ."}
{"text":"Very clean, smells good, friendly staff. We have dined in and do take out. The beef Pho and Veggie pho with tofu is soooooo good! So fresh! Spring rolls are great also. Definitely our go to spot for pho"}
{"text":"First time here, was not impressed. The servers were young guys, did not come to check on us once the food was brought out. The food wasn't all that great either for the price. I can say I will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"This place is really good! It started going down hill for a minute, then I gave it another chance and all I can say is mmmmmmmmmmmmm. The spring rolls are delicious and so is the bon bo hue"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Pho place to eat. The food is always delicious. Staff is terrific and never disappointed."}
{"text":"Pho Than is my one and only. I tried this place because it was closer to home and I should have driven the extra distance. The only thing I liked was the spring rolls. I got my pho and it had a huge fly in it!! Not like it just landed either like it was sitting and marinating in it for a while!! Ewwww not going back"}
{"text":"Great food.  Excellent price.  The bowl was huge.  Way more than I could eat in one sitting.  All the ingredients were fresh, and high quality."}
{"text":"My friends and I come here every Friday (Pho Friday). We love the staff and obviously the food is amazing. A big bowl of P5 and some egg rolls. Mmm. Don't forget to get lost in the sauce."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Their Pho Ga (chicken Pho) is one of the best I have tried in PHX. Very flavorful, meat is super tender and juicy, and plenty of it. Kids meals have great options at a fantastic price! Daughter LOVES beef Pho and was very happy with it. Good spring rolls and peanut sauce. Fantastic and attentive service. 
Bookmarking as a favorite Vietnamese place in the valley. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place is, meh. Not amazing and not terrible. Service was fast and pleasant, food was okay but each dish lacked something. 
I will preface my review with the fact that I have been to Vietnam and know authentic when I eat it.
We ordered the fresh spring rolls and they were pretty plain, ordinary, and had way too much vermicelli and not enough meat and veggies. We had the bun bo hue, which didn't seem to have any lemongrass flavor at all, and it lacked blood cake. The pho broth had a simple flavor, nothing that would knock your socks off. Even with building the flavor with basil, lime, sprouts, jalepeno, hoisin and sriracha, it still didn't taste that great (yes, I know there is no sriracha in Vietnam). 
I would recommend this establishment to those who have never tried Vietnamese food and/or for those who want to explore the cuisine, it is good. For me, I'll stick to my favorite spot in town."}
{"text":"Very authentic Viet food, my mom had the pho and says it's very fragrant and the bun bo hue tastes good"}
{"text":"Pretty nice little place. The restaurant is clean and the staff was friendly and attentive. I ordered the chicken Pho and it was really good. It's nice to have a pho place down the street from my house and it's decently priced!"}
{"text":"So here's the deal.  I don't like pho in general.  It's a pretty bland food.  I'm more of a spicy beef soup/stew kind of guy.  The pho sate though, it actually has flavor.  Finally something in the broth that can jump up and say \"What up! I got flavor!\"  It's obviously not the most authentic way to make it, but I don't care when it tastes better.  Pho is a good meal to fill you up when you down the broth with it.  Just watch your sodium intake.  Side note: They actually know how to cook their beef tendon."}
{"text":"We were looking for a Vietnamese restaurant and the raving reviews led us to this establishment for lunch. The interior could use better lighting. There was a small local following, but the ambiance was still sparse except for the large TV facing the tables horizontally arranged. 

For appetizer, the Pork Spring Roll ($3) was outright delicious on the inside, but the wrapper was extremely gummy and hard to chew. Not recommended. 

The Grilled Chicken Rice ($5.95) came with a good amount of chicken with tender, albeit greasy, crispy edges nicely seasoned. The rice plate also came with a fried fish cake, bowl of soup, and broken rice. The large piece of fish cake was delicious, but also crispy to the point that tasted refried at least several times. 

The disappointing aspect of this meal was the Grilled Chicken turned out deep-fried after Santi had inquired about it. The server confirmed that it was initially grilled, but then deep-fried to reheat the chicken. I was particularly disappointed because I had good reasons for not wanting it fried. Even if I had wanted it, the chicken was not phenomenal. Therefore, I walked away extremely unhappy for the misleading information on the menu. The restaurant also didn't do much to respond to our displeasure, which led me to write this review to warn the public about these misleading practices, especially for those with health or dietary restrictions. 

Santi ordered the Hu Tieu Mi Dac Biet ($6.50) that came with egg noodles on the side, squid, shrimp, quail egg, pork, pork rinds, chives, and soup on the side. The pork-based soup was solid with a tinge of sweetness to accentuate the pork flavor. The pork rind again, tasted refried and old. The egg noodles carried a decent amount of texture, but the oily sauce did not match the profile of hoisin, shoyu, and oyster sauce described by the server. 

Service was friendly and attentive. However, both of us were displeased with the outcome of our dining experience. I don't think the restaurant was trying to purposely deceive us, but as customers, we also deserve to know if we were really getting what we asked for. The food was not memorable. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to try this place. I almost always order Pho Dac Biet (special pho) where ever I go and unfortunately this place didn't really do it for me. The restaurant was very clean (as I would expect a brand new place to be) and servers were attentive. In the area I think little Saigon has the best pho Dac Biet, their pho tai is not anything to write home about but the Dac Biet is awesome!!!  My boyfriend ordered the Bún tht nng and he said it was much better then Little Saigons."}
{"text":"Decided to try a new Pho restaurant, I must say that I was impressed. The food was amazing, the service was just as impressive Eizel did a great job. We were immediately greeted and felt welcome. The spring rolls are delicious, and of course the Pho was AMAZING!!!! Highly recommend it and we will defiantly be returning."}
{"text":"Been here 2 times, the first time was probably last year. Went here again last week, and I honestly thought I had the best tasting broth out of all the others. The first time I have the spicy beef noodles, bun bo hue? And that was very good in my memory. 
Had spring rolls as well and that peanut sauce was AMAZING! LOVE it. If you like peanuts, please give that thing a try if you haven't already. Yes, I will go back just for that. 
Service was pretty good! The girl that took our order was very nice and patient, and got us everything we needed, and my order right! 
I like my pho with green onions only, and steamed beansprouts, and for some reason, most pho restaurants can never get that right. So I rate Phoenix Pho extra well for accuracy. 
The only thing that kind of bothered me was when I first ordered I told the girl no cilantro, and no white onions, and another guy overheard and proceeded to say, just put no onions, it's a mix anyways. But........I want green onions. So now I just say green onions only. Easier that way. And she hooked me up and I got my pho with green onions only. So 5 stars it is!"}
{"text":"Started coming here because I refuse to go back to my old favorite Pho Avina because now it is seriously gross. This place was a welcome escape from them. The pho is good, big portions, and the service is good. The servers are very friendly and even remembered me when I went back with my boyfriend after going there with my brother for the first time. I think this will be my new go-to."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the 1st time today. The Pho and spring rolls are authentic and delish! Prices are reasonable and the portions are big. Excellent customer service.The restaurant and rest room were very clean. Will recommend to friends and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice place, i like the design inside. Nice tv on the wall while u eat, price is very fair, food is good, broth is tasty. Service was good and polite. Very clean establishment from what i saw. Id come bak."}
{"text":"This is the worst Vietnamese restaurant I have gone to . Food is decent but the atmosphere sucks. No air condition is running and several flies fly around when we eat. They charged us for 18% tip after tax. I am fine with paying 18% but not this kind of customer service and environment . I asked why I have to pay the tip after tax and they told us to eat at home. This is rude and unacceptable service. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Pho nking bomb. I placed my order and walked in n out with the best pho I've had in quite a while. It's a must if your in the area."}
{"text":"The Pho was good. I had the B1 which includes brisket, tripe, and meatballs was tasty. The service wasn't great they were watching TV and not paying too much attention to the customers."}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I didn't like the Pho so as soon as I took a bite I sent it back and told them I didn't like it. They were very rude but still took it back and then when then the check came they still charged me even though I didn't eat it. I complained and informed them they accidentally charged me and the employee told me I still had to pay because it was my fault for ordering it. They were incredibly rude the way they handled the whole situation. Worst pho. Worst customer service. 0 stars for me."}
{"text":"Great service, flavorful Pho, good prices, weird that they are not open Thursdays."}
{"text":"I asked what the special of the day was and the waitress shrieked with her face and said \"I wouldn't recommend it.\" At that point I was thinking, OMGeeee should I leave? I like to push the note, so I asked her \"what is it?\" (And in my head I was prepared for her to tell me \"local cat\") Meow! However, what she described was in the same ballpark.... Something with \"pork blood\". It is \"DacBiet-Bun Rieu\". Ooook, we're taking it back to the Old Country here. 

Our meals were ok, but nothing to write home about. Pho is one of my favorite foods and I would say this one was middle of the road with seasoning but there was a hearty portion of tripe tendon, medium rare beef and meatball.  

It was a little awkward that other than my family, there was 1 other couple in the restaurant dining."}
{"text":"We were greeted and seated immediately. The atmosphere is bright and welcoming. The spring rolls and the peanut sauce were incredible and our food did not disappoint."}
{"text":"I come here routinely.  I'm from a town with a strong Vietnamese presence so I have grew to love Pho.  This is the only place I have found that does it right! Plus the super  bowl reminds me of the XXL bowls from home. Great family environment and the staff has memorized my order already so when I walk in they just check and bring me my usual. They play movies too on their big screen so there is always something interesting to watch when I'm tackling a super bowl! 6 stars out of 5, so good!"}
{"text":"This place is ON POINT! Very decent prices and the food is wonderful. Extremely friendly staff. Don't miss this gem"}
{"text":"I come here like every wee, the pho is consistently good, the waiters are friendly and make good recommendations"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  I wish I could have taken pictures but I was so excited to eat! Really clean establishment and there's a huge TV on the wall playing movies. Everything was delicious and food came out fast as well!  Happy to have found this place!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here today and this will be my new go to Pho/ Vietnamese lunch place! I got the fried wontons, (which have actual pork inside), and the grilled pork and egg roll rice vermicelli bowl. I poured my fish sauce all over it and dug in. Mmm...mmmm, good! I also had the Thai iced tea, which was not too sweet and very refreshing."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for delicious Pho in my area, and when I went to pick my car up a few weeks ago I was ecstatic to find that a new place had opened right in my neighborhood. My husband and I immediately decided to try it out. The interior is clean and they have a nice TV for those interested. The service was friendly and quick. 

We each had a soup and shared an order of Ch giò, which my husband noted was the \"best [he's] ever had\", I found them quite tasty as well. The soups were top notch! Our check that day was very reasonable. 

Right now, the menu is a little small, which is to be expected from a newly opened restaurant. As their customer base grows, I hope they'll add more (like boba!) 



I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"P9 all day every day man.
Soursop boba. 
So delicious.
Waitstaff is the best and very competent"}
{"text":"TON of food for the money. Two meals for sure. Ordered the #9 which was delicious! I recommend the wontons as well.  The service was excellent, extremely personable staff. If you pay cash they give you a stamp card."}
{"text":"Always a great place for pho. Great customer service and very nice boba. Great place for first time having pho and Chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is Pho-King amazing! We just happened on this restaurant while driving through the area, and everything was fantastic. We had the Chicken Pho, Shrimp Pho, and Spring Rolls. The portions were large, the servers were pleasant, and the price was very inexpensive, especially considering how good the food was and how large the portions were. In fact it was so good, and so inexpensive, I ended up driving well out of my way just to get some food to go!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Was driving in from southern CA and Yelp reviews guided us here! Pho was awesome and I was not disappointed! Prices were very reasonable too! Will come back when we visit AZ again!!!!"}
{"text":"The pho is good, the egg rolls are huge! The service is better than the other pho places in the valley. I was pleasantly surprised with this place"}
{"text":"This place is really good for Pho! The only thing that I didn't like was when I ordered the ox tail pho I was tasting BONE in every bite, I couldn't enjoy the pho like I wanted because I had to be careful eating. Everything else was delicious and my gf absolutely loved the pho. They have several flavors of boba tea and I tried the strawberry. The location is convenient with a lot of parking in the area. I will be returning for a quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"My first time here... The food and service was excellent! I love the casual and calm atmosphere. Yes, the young waiters were in one corner on their laptops but it doesn't matter to me... the place is clean, I was greeted right away, the staff was very friendly, my drinks were always full, they serve very good portions at a good price, and the food was tasty! I will definitely be back! I've been to a couple Pho places around here that are the complete opposite with paper thin/dry meat (No thanks!). If I wanted beef jerky, I'd go to the store and gets some beef jerky. :)"}
{"text":"Ordered from Doordash. Requested extra lime.. got extra lemon! Lemon is not lime!

Broth was more anise than beef.."}
{"text":"The pho was pretty good... Was surprised. The bowl isn't as big as other pho places. Had more of a family atmosphere than a date/chill type of vibe. Lit up bright in there so if you are looking for a dim light spot, then pass on this."}
{"text":"Very clean and bright, tucked away in a corner of the road would possibly pose a problem.  Nice fresh vegetables, egg roll were decent, not amazing.  The Pho was really great!  After all, that is what I came for.  Excellent staff, checked on us often and made good menu suggestions.  My husband had the pork chops and rice, he enjoyed it and that came with soup also.  Price is really reasonable.  Not sure how Phoenix Pho ended up in Glendale but we are happy to have them here!!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here, always great food.  One of my top Pho places. Service is always friendly and out going."}
{"text":"I don't give a 5 very often but Phoenix Pho deserves it! As you first enter the space is well lit, bright and open. It is spotlessly clean and smells great. Tables are not crowded and chairs are comfortable.
The menu is easy to read and the staff was eager to explain any questions. Be sure to get a take home menu for take out.
Best spring rolls in the valley...they are huge and the peanut sauce is plentiful for sure.
We also got the combo Pho soup...a pure delight in a Vietnamese classic. Broth is deep in flavor yet subtle in a very good way...hints of star anise and it comes with a unique chinese herb that makes the dish (never had it before anywhere...the owner explained that it is expensive but needed for proper Pho). 
The owner came to our table and it is clear he take great pride in his Pho and for very good reason. best I have had and I have many.
We will be back which is the greatest compliment I can give. You must try this gem...
The best came at the end...the bill...so reasonable for what we were served...a 3rd lower than I expected. What a great find.
Treat yourself to a real fine asian meal and dining experience."}
{"text":"This is my wife and I's local pho restaurant.  We have never been dissatisfied with our meals, we always leave with leftovers. Thier vegan options are decent enough which is all I have tried.  They consistently make dishes that we really enjoy eating. I just wish they were still open when the bars close!"}
{"text":"My favorite pho place in town. Clean, good service, and the food is always good. Love the Mango Boba."}
{"text":"Wow, delicious Pho. It's not greasy like some mother places. Great place food service. Check it out if you love Pho like me."}
{"text":"I'm kinda new to this Pho thing. I'm not even sure that I'm even pronouncing it right. 
Of the maybe 4 or 5 places that I've tried, this is my favorite.  The staff is always fast and friendly.  The Pho is hot, delicious and inexpensive. I haven't tried all of them but the chicken was my favorite and the meatball, my least favorite.  I even got it to go once and did the final assemble at home and was equally satisfied.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"First I have to say this place is amazing.  If you haven't been to a pho you need to come to this location.  The service is just as good as the food, it's family owned and they take pride in what they do.  I've been to plenty of phos but none compare here.  If your visiting or live in the area I highly recommend you stop by and see peter.  My son loves it here as well and he's very picky.   Don't go buy junk food ....come here an live and eat right"}
{"text":"Been here several times now and the food has always met my expectations. The two must trys are the bun bo hue and the spring rolls. Highly recommend them. 

The spring rolls are fresh made everyday and the use actual peanut sauce.

Im not a fan of pork blood, tendon, or tripe therefore I had them remove them from my bun bo hue instead they replaced it with more brisket. I also added pho beef rounds to it so it was extra delicious!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best pho places in Arizona. Broth is fresh and has a great flavor."}
{"text":"I like this place because it's close to home. Their soup is pretty good. Bun Bo Hue is very mild here. The -1 star is really for their boba drinks. The boba itself is good, but the drink mix is mixed with milk and powder. It's pretty gross."}
{"text":"Had the super bowl pho and the shrimp and pork wontons and it was AMAZING also the staff is very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Im a usual customer, and i always get the same shitty service from Peter, and another guy with glasses. I can be there for an hour and only get checked on once and that's only when my food is given to me. They always make a bad, nasty face when you don't tip (after their shitty service), but how do i tip when i can't even get my water refilled after 45 minutes and have shitty faces given to me? Right after they are done giving me my food they go sit down on a computer and just look at you not even considering that you may need something. I dont want to go to a restaurant if i have to be asking for things, thats why i dont tip. If anything i can clock in and serve myself since thats what you have to do at this restaurant. Also, i wouldn't need a refill if you put less ice in the cup and have it be more water than ice. Food is great, absolutely terrible customer service."}
{"text":"We've been coming here ever since we moved down the street and that's about three years now and every time we come we are never disappointed. The service is great and the food is always fresh and tasteful. Perfect and the prices are just right. Every opportunity I have I bring new people and share this great experience with them. Great taste of Vietnamese food. We've become usuals that we do not need the menu; I would highly recommend this spot. It is a true gem."}
{"text":"Finally !! A pho joint down the street from my house!! Everyone is so friendly and I got my food within 10 minutes. The food is good but not the best pho I've had. Will I come back again ? Pho sho!"}
{"text":"Service was great! Food was not. I got the Phoenix pho and the meat and other ingredients were very tasteless. The flavor was very dull and the meat had no flavor what so ever. I know this place has a lot of good ratings and maybe it was just my bad time of coming. Just don't get what I got."}
{"text":"I love this place! I come here at least once a week because the food is terrific! The people are always nice and they have a big screen TV always playing movies. My favorite is the Pho Noddles with the Spring roll and Pork Steak. The Squid soup is also another great dish I get regularly it is great if you're a seafood lover. The prices are cheap and the food is always great quality. I would recommend this place to everyone and anyone!"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome pho. Delicious summer rolls (spring rolls). Seafood egg noodle soup was tasty as well. Fast and friendly staff. Yup, I'm sold ."}
