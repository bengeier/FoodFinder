{"text":"It's not every day that you walk into a bar to be greeted by a large tree.  But there it is.  Real, fake, who the F cares? It's still a tree.  In a BAR.  It's ambience, people!  And this place has it in spades.  Good jukebox, awesome beer selection, prime digs.  WAY better than the previous Paul's."}
{"text":"Work on your bartending, boys: Don't scoop ice with a glass -- bad form, and potentially unsafe. And for heaven's sake, use a strainer when you make a martini. Chunks of unintentional ice floating in a straight-up martini is just bad. When all you have is drinks, you need exceptional bartenders and techniques. Right now, you don't."}
{"text":"Paul don't work here no more and the tree is fake.  Despite these hard truths Paul's Club is still my favorite afterwork bar.  Its a great place to meet friends, load up a nice juke box, or find a scrumptious piece of ass.

The weekend brings wide range of clientele and thats when things become quite interesting.  I prefer quieter week day nights when the wonderful bartenders have time to chat."}
{"text":"Walking into Paul's Club the first thing we saw was a guy checking IDs, who told us that as long as we didn't hug him, we were good to go. The second thing we saw was a giant tree lit up by white Christmas lights. If you squinted, you barely noticed that the branches were either glued or cemented in place.

The bar ran the length of the establishment, and four or five bartenders bounced back and fourth between patrons, waiting for the inebriated to pass by so they could ask for stories. Chairs and tables lined the wall opposite of the bar, where groups of people collected to drink.

The background music was subtle, and easily forgotten amidst the lively conversations taking place. Overall the bar was clean, with a moderate noise level. Bartenders were friendly and cheerful. Definitely a class above some of the other bars visited that night.

I ordered a Malibu Bay Breeze, and they topped it off with a lime which was perfect as it added a brightness that the drink doesn't usually have, and the acidity popped against the tartness of the cranberry and sweetness of the pineapple."}
{"text":"Early hours (I call them \"old people hours\", when the folks like me 25-30 and over can chill and hear each other have conversations over drinks that taste good) so maybe before 11pm I'd give Paul's 3.5 stars. It's a bar, nothing too special. Bloody marys are good, there are nice places to sit, and I do like The Tree. It's fun to tell people it's real and they had to build the bar around it, get special building permits, etc. Just smell the tree and you can tell! lol..

The later hours, however, for me are another story. That's when Paul's caters more toward the younger \"let's get wasteypants\" crowd. You can't hear anyone, it's hard to move around without getting 'bowed in the face if you're 5'1 or getting beer sloshed on you by some overzealous bros, the floor is STICKY, and it's nearly impossible to get a drink if you're short and not overly aggressive. I think people got served more than once before I got a single glance from a bartender. I get that I'm not great at being loud and obnoxious and grabbing one's attention, but should it have to be that way? I guess at the undergraddy bars, it does... Not my scene, so for me this is when I give Paul's 1 star (sorry!).

So the average between the two atmospheres is 2.25 or 2 stars for me as a petite-height average 30-something female..."}
{"text":"I remember this place for it's strong drinks and because it reminds you of the kind of bedroom I dreamed about having as a kid . . . one that resembles a jungle. When you walk in the first thing you'll notice are the trees . . . in the bar. 

It's close enough to the UW campus to walk to but not filled with the obnoxious fake ID crowd so you can actually have decent conversations."}
{"text":"Besides Brats, Mondays, Brothers, Gritty and maybe maayyyybbbbeee the City there is no bar I cringe more hearing when suggested than Paul's Club. (yes Wando's over Paul's)

Since when did the presence of indoor botany lull is into accepting the constant overcrowding, bottleneck seating design, overly loud music, selectively chummy bartenders and trifling higher prices.  

Honestly, besides the tree there is really nothing cool about this bar.  You rarely can get a seat and movement between the beanstalk and the couches is irritatingly entrapping.  If by some miracle you go on a weekday and the place isn't swamped, it's tolerable and offers something a bit classier than a dive or a college intox-fest.

....but almost always the coastie sorority girls and their male shadows just run this place.  I'm not even that offended by the coastie-presence as I live amongst it now but Paul's bartenders are just really chummy and the place isn't well laid out.  I guess I'm not in, so I'll happily be out."}
{"text":"I miss Paul. Cool guy. Sang Sinatra songs if you asked him to. RIP.  Great jukebox still. Cool bartenders."}
{"text":"This is an okay place. It's a good place to start a night out. There seemed to be a lot of middle aged/ preppy people there but maybe we were there at the wrong time? I don't know, but I still had a pretty good time. It gets crowded fast so if you want a seat get there early!"}
{"text":"It could be so much more...since the old owner died (probably 5-8 years ago), the flavor's a bit gone...his showpiece was to sing New York, New York periodically throughout the night.  That made it worthwhile.  Now, its pretty much a rabidly crowded place with seating that makes it difficult or impossible to really talk much with your friends.  The tree is great, albeit fake since the original burned several years ago, but now you have so much to talk about with your out-of-town friends when you bring them here!"}
{"text":"Paul's Club is a bar that would do great in any city with a vibe.  Madison should be proud of this one.

I haven't found a jukebox of its equal anywhere in the world.  They have great beers on tap.  They have terrific barware ... big buckets of heavy glass with a great feel to them when their filled with your favorite booze and mixer.

Maybe the place is a bit crowded on the weekends, but as the whiskey kicks in and A Tribe Called Quest comes on the jukebox followed by the Strokes or The Stones this bar feels like the greatest place in the world."}
{"text":"They seemed pretty cool until they decide to close early with a crowded bar. They wanted everyone to chug their beer even though last call had been about two minutes earlier. Very unprofessional. I hope I don't return here again."}
{"text":"Cheap, strong drinks and a tree in the center.

Paul's gets sort of crazy on the weekend, but it's a good escape from the UW-scene (no offense) with the convenience of still being on State Street. The bouncers are usually pretty cool too."}
{"text":"There's a giant tree in the middle of the bar. Nothing else is really memorable, other than the fact that this is one of the popular spots for employees of a certain healthcare IT company headquartered in Verona. When it's not overcrowded the atmosphere is pretty decent."}
{"text":"I lived in Madison from 99-05.  Paul's was definitely my favorite bar.  I am pretty far removed from Madison now, but when I saw the review a few comments down that confidently states that the tree is fake I felt the need to provide some knowledge.  THE TREE IS REAL.  There was a fire there years ago and during the renovation while the bar was missing the front facade they took the opportunity to bring in the tree.  The leaves are real and treated to not be a fire hazard and periodically they add more to replace what people pull off in an attempt verify authenticity.  

Moving on, the bar itself was always awesome.  I was a regular and the bartenders definitely knew how to take care of a regular.  I know that some bartenders have left since my time there, but I also know that not all have.  

The ambiance of the place is great.  The tree is definitely the shining star but other things play into it too.  The layout of the bar is a drawback, being too narrow, but the leather couches are a nice touch and I always felt that the shape of the bar made it feel more intimate.  A lot of people have commented about it being too crowded but in all my time in Madison or anywhere for that matter, I haven't found a good college bar that wasn't.  Granted, if you are not in your early 20's you probably don't want to be there on a Friday or Saturday night.  Overall the bar has a slightly classier feel, good place to take a date earlier in the night for some drinks before dinner. 

The juke box is awesome and pretty unique too.  It has good albums that you know along with mixes made by the bartenders and some good local music too.  

Writing this has me itching to get back to Madison and stop in for a drink."}
{"text":"What the eff?  There's a tree inside! 

Great location, though I had to have passed by this place at least a dozen times before I realized it was a bar, and not, like, a place where a guy named Paul and his friends go to smoke and play poker.

The bartenders are a little apathetic, at least this one guy, a total sourpuss, who was serving when a friend and I stopped by on a Friday during happy hour.  Like, we're giving you money!  We expect happiness during happy hour!  Etc.  Maybe he was tired.

Came here again late-night one time with a group of people from work.  That's when Paul's Club goes from being a somewhat sketchy local joint to being a hoppin' bar.  Love the Christmas lights!"}
{"text":"Soooo... straight away, THERE IS A TREE IN HERE! I couldn't believe it. That is amazing, anywho... prices? Reasonable, atmostphere? kind of relaxing. They have really nice mood lights in there and the staff/bartenders are REALLY nice. It is kind of low key and you sort of have to be looking for the sign or just glaring to your right or left to see it. It is a tiny doorway with some shallow windows."}
{"text":"Paul's Club is my favorite bar on State Street.  It always has been since I first found it in my later college years.  Now it is my favorite by default.  I'm too old and tired to do the State Street thing all that often these days, but when I do it's invariably Paul's I gravitate toward.  The paradox I have with Paul's is this: it is an excellent bar to meet up with friends and have a nice conversation during the weekdays, but I'm rarely down on State during the week.  It's the weekend when I drag myself from Middleton, and it's the weekend when Paul's Club becomes standing room only.

When you go on a weeknight the place is perfect.  The jukebox is consistently good, the mixed drinks are on the strong side but still well-made, and you can generally claim a couch.  During the weekends it really is a different bar.  Sometimes it isn't unpleasant but I've had a lot of experiences standing three deep at the bar just hoping to catch the bartender's eye.  This is not an enjoyable time, and after more than a few of these nights I've told myself that I would probably stop going.  But the memories are too strong, and invariably the next time I stop things go smoothly.  

I've never had a problem with the bartenders but I've never tried to run a tab either.  My old college friend from Chicago did a few years back, and when he ended up drinking to oblivion and forgetting his card it turned into a bit of a fiasco.  But aside from that time we've usually made it a point to go there whenever he's back in town.  We each get a couple of Paulaners and reminisce about the good old times.  I remember back in my late college years Paul's was for some reason frequented by some members of the football team, and apparently my roommate knew Jim Sorgi, which led to a semi-awesome picture of me obviously annoying him.  Woo-hoo!"}
{"text":"Perfect go-to for drinks before a show, either at the Overture or the Orpheum. It's so close you can see the front doors of the Overture, allowing you to be able to leave 1 minute before meeting friends or 5 minutes before in seats. No food here, but I've heard you can carry in food without an issue. Before shows, this place can get completely packed then will empty out nicely.

Their \"new\" location is now just great (and has been around for years). Paul's has the large, lit tree that adds a level of charm and chill. Staff are hit-or-miss but that's par for the course in the area.

Fairly good beer selection; not all IPAs and APAs like many bars around. I stick to beer here as I enjoy their choices, prices, size of pour, and preparation speed."}
{"text":"We came here before the comedy club show. We've never been here before but I really liked the atmosphere. It was a chill bar, sort of for older adults. You don't see much of a college crowd here as the drinks are a little pricey for a single G &T but it's whatever. It's a quieter bar which I can appreciate as I hate yelling to have a conversation or nodding my head stupidly pretending I heard what my friend said to me a foot away unlike some of the other bars on state, but then again there's a different kind of group here. The bartender was really quick with helping us and providing us with drink specials. It's a little pricey but I'd come here again"}
{"text":"Paul's club is such a right of passage for any true Madisonian! Nothing too special about this bar. The selection of beers are great. The place has a lounge vibe with low tables and chairs. It's famous for a large tree in the center of the bar. 

Location is great, in a row with some other Madison bars and close to the capital square  It's generally really busy all the time, but worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Am here right now.  Very crowded, cheap drinks, cool vibe.  Non pretentious.  Am having a great time!!!"}
{"text":"I agree with Michael. This is really just your run-o-the-mill college bar, except for the fact that it has a humongous fake tree whose limbs branch out and dominate the entire place.  It makes for an unusual setting. Not much else is really outstanding about this joint."}
{"text":"Hmmm I love that this bar has a tree in it, what I do not love is the weird bar smell that makes you question what it is they are trying to cover up. I stopped here before a show and ordered a margarita that came garnished with not one but two....Fruit flies. 
The jokes on me... I drank it anyway after a amateur level bug water rescue, I'm not proud. Anyway I probably won't rush back to Paul's."}
{"text":"Always good! My favorite paunchy bartender is now the manager. He still makes a great old fashioned! Bless him and the staff of Paul's Club!"}
{"text":"Being a little behind the learning curve in my typical Capricornian fashion, I didn't start college until I was 24.  Why is this important you ask?  Well most college students spend their 4/5 college years at Frat parties and \"binge drinking\" bars with stellar $1 bomb shots and booty shaking music.  Fine I confess I spent my fair share of time in those establishments as well...however, when I actually began attending the UW I spent more time at the upper end of State Street and Capital area bars.  More low key than bump and grind, the type of place's that offer quality over quantity and Paul's Club is one of my three favorite bars in the Downtown Madison Area.

I still go there when I go home, it is small, narrow, dark, loungey, it can feel a bit cramped on a Friday or Saturday night in the fall, but on a weekday or even a summer weekend it is pretty comfortable.  

They typically have a pretty good selection of music on the Juke Box.  The staff is friendly and attentive, the beer selection is amazing...okay well I have to disclose my lack of objectiveness.  I LOVE wheat beers...and there are a number of choices at Paul's Club.  

It most definitely wouldn't be a review with out the mention of the Large Tree adorned with white Christmas lights that adds to the mystical magic of Paul's Club, it feels like you are drinking in a modern day version of A Midsummer Night's Dream...so grab a Delirium Tremens  and a seat at the bar under the tree and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went there on a Saturday night a few months back (May to be specific). The spot is really cool. The atmosphere was great, great mix of artistic and interesting people. The bartenders actually have an extensive knowledge of cocktails (very rare for State Street).  The only complaint I have is that waitresses focused more on the exotic looking bouncer than on the clientele. I guess I don't blame them considering I'm pretty sure I've seen him in a Calvin Klein ad."}

In one of the few instances of my life, I ask you not to live vicariously through Garth Algar as it applies to the remodeled Paul's Club. I just stopped in for the first time, and let me tell you... in with the old, in with the new. 

I loved the vibe's Paul's club used to give; comfy/intimate/unique. The new setup offers the same ambiance, there's just more room. The effort that went into getting the tree in there can't be understated... (it's pretty darn cool). The bar still offers an amazing array of options (they have ouzo, which is pretty rare for a State St. joint not titled Nick's), and employ bartenders who (still) really know what they're doing. The guy who served me even knew how to make a Sazerac offhand... which is pretty cool. 

All in-all, I came in skeptical and walked out a self-reassured fan. It was like hearing a new album from a favorite band that didn't disappoint, while simultaneously eliciting the same nostalgia you felt the first time you listened. 

Party On, Paul's Club"}
{"text":"The bartender allowed me to sample a few items on tap.  I went with the Pineapple Cider. Such a refreshing different taste."}
{"text":"Strong drinks, great juke, and a mini-nature preserve--what a great combo!  Next time you are there ask a bartender for a peanut to bring out the trained squirrel they have living in the tree."}
{"text":"Don't forget to water the tree during your visit... I'm kidding! It's probably fake, but that dust on it isn't a sure-fire indicator. This is a great spot to go before and after the show. It's centrally located between the Orpheum, Overture Center and the Comedy Club.

The bartenders have worked their for years (I think my bartender mentioned that the average is around 15 years)! But, you need to be careful when you choose to go. Be aware of when shows are and that it may be packed just before and after.

If you're lucky, you can get seating for your group on one of their low and comfy couches/chairs. But, I did say low seating, not the most ideal if you want to set your drink down or carry a conversation with your buddy across said table.

Overall, Paul's Club has a great location and I will continue to go here before a concert (and after)!"}
{"text":"I love any bar that has my favorite beer (delirium tremens) on tap.  The bartenders are attentive and have just the right amount of attitude with more difficult guests, which turns out to be entertaining.  The place isn't too stuffy or fancy, and of course the tree there is their signature.   My only complaint is the layout.  Especially when it gets busier, the bar gets really backed up and you really cannot easily get around with all the seating areas they have next to the bar.  So just a minor inconvenience really.  

Will be back."}
{"text":"One star because zero isn't an option. I ordered a beer I've had multiple times elsewhere. Beer came out and tasted off - it was clear the draft lines were dirty. I asked the waitress if they had other options in the same style and she offered to replace the beer. When she set down the beer I was told I \"owed $5\" and that her manager Jimmy was making her collect. Please don't offer to \"replace\" by selling me another beer... I went to speak to Jimmy the manager and was told he would call the police if I didn't pay $5. Paul's has the most unprofessional management I've ever witnessed and I will never return."}
{"text":"They have a huge (fake, but realistic) tree in the middle of the bar. They even hang their citrus from the tree. The drinks are great and reasonable, and they have very comfortable couches and chairs. Definitely not a college bar, I recommend them to people who usually go to bars on the square or if you are waiting for your show at the Overture to start (as we did)."}
{"text":"Randomly stopped in Madison on a cross country trip. I had been to Madison once before to visit a friend in college and I vaguely recall a beer and brat drunken haze. Now beyond our college years, my friend and I decided we wanted to treat ourselves to something nice so we headed for State street and walked around until something peaked our interest. We had been driving for 15 hours and were really hungry and in need of some good beverages. We came across Paul's and couldn't have asked for a better experience. It is a bit on the upscale side and we were pretty ragged looking, but that didn't seem to be a problem. Our waiter James was awesome and he was really funny and helpful with the menu. We had no idea what to expect and ended up ordering a few different plates as well as a couple cocktails. Everything was really good and the prices weren't bad either for the high quality of food you're getting. Would recommend this place to anyone heading towards Madison."}
{"text":"\"The bar with the tree\" - the signature tag line of this restaurant, and the description each time I want to bring an out of town friend out to their favorite Madison bar.

Cozy and dimly lit environment, which has a nice area along one side with leather chairs for chatting the night away. Just be sure to snag a seat when you see one open up, as it's pretty limited."}
{"text":"The vibe is always weird here. Full of has-beens, hipsters and the random few alternative college students. The only thing that draws you there is the tree. There's nothing really special about it and I've never had an outstanding time there. Mediocre with fine drinks."}
{"text":"Paul's only get's three stars for now. I'll have to go back to Madison  to see if it earns back the other two. It gets the first star for the tree. I mean, sweet Jesus, there's a tree in the bar, how cool is that? It gets a second star for great couches and leather chairs. It gets a third star for their Old Fashioneds, easily the best I've ever tasted. But they get docked two stars for the crowdedness and that asshole bartender that gets all pissy when more than one person orders a drink and then ignores you the rest of the night..."}
{"text":"CROWDED! This place is always crowded on the weekends (a good thing!) but the space is not conducive for huge crowds. I am always pushing my way down the center to find a place where I can hopefully weasel my way towards the bar to grab a drink. 

Regardless of this, I love coming here! It's a great place to meet friends and have a beer. I've been both on the weeknights and weekends. Boyfriend and I come here during the week to sit at the bar and grab a beer. It's a great place to hang out. They have fun, throwback music during the week, and it's oftentimes very easy to get some couch seating. During the weekend, I often come here to meet friends. If you're lucky, you can snag some couch seating, which is oh so fun! Reminds me of having bottle service in Vegas for some reason. It's very cozy and a great place to hang out, talk, and drink. I probably wouldn't end my night here. It's definitely the kind of place to start the night and then head up or down State. 

Good vibes here, too. Love the lighting-- not too dark, not too bright! And the tree-- adore the tree! It gives off such a unique, fun ambiance. Do not believe people who tell you it is real. It's not. ;)

They also have a great tap list of beers I've never heard of, which I love. I am always down to try a new beer, so this is the place to do it. Bartenders are very knowledgable about the taps, so I generally will say that I like Beer X and get a recommendation off that."}
{"text":"There's a freakin' tree in the bar!  It'd be pretty sweet if the bar had a pet squirrel or something.

A great low-key place to relax earlier in the evening, which makes this one of my bars of choice.  I really like the atmosphere, where you have the seats grouped together, making this a great bar for taking it easy with friends with a good conversation and a tasty beverage.  There's a couple small tv's (installed exclusively for watching Badgers games no doubt) but in no way to they take away from the relaxing group atmosphere.  There's a jukebox for those of you who like to be their own dj, and most importantly there's a nice selection of beers.  When in Wisconsin, drink Wisconsin brews.  They're all delicious, and they serve a whole bunch of 'em.  Gravitate toward the tree."}
{"text":"I went to Paul's Club when I was 19 - this is the only bar in Madison that rejected my fake, which basically means its one of the best bars in Madison for those of us closer to 30 than to 20."}
{"text":"I needed to grab a drink before I went in to see a band at the Orpheum and would have to spend 6 or 7 bucks on a PBR. I'm not unfamiliar with Madison, but I've never been anywhere on this block. I walked past it with a couple of friends (including one friend who has lived in town for the past couple years), and we decided to give it a try.

The coolest thing about this bar is the tree. There's a huge tree in the middle of the bar with nice lights on it. It looks awesome and might even ensure I come back. Other than that, the bar is pretty dark and the rest of the decor doesn't really seem to mesh well. It kind of feels like a sports bar combined with a hipster hangout. Luckily, I am somewhat of a hipster and I am really into sports.

Beer was a touch overpriced, but nothing too bad. They had a pretty great selection too. Mixed drinks were pretty cheap ($4.50 for a rum & coke), but not particularly strong. The place was pretty full for a Sunday evening (and no one was even watching the football game).

The crowd was a little older than I was expecting. Everyone looked to be 30+. Maybe it was just the night I went, but I'm 22 and I felt like a baby. Beyond that, I don't know what it was about everyone, but it felt kinda awkward.

Overall? Probably will return, especially to avoid spending my whole paycheck on drinks at the Orpheum."}
{"text":"We definitely need this bar back home! I don't think it gets much cooler than a giant tree with its branches blanketing the entire bar.

Decent tap and bottle selection. Only a few interesting beers, but life's pretty good when the local standby is Wisconsin's own \"Spotted Cow\", a pretty good beer. The bar staff was friendly, and quite accommodating, but a bit disorganized.

The couches were very comfortable, great for relaxing to the tunes from the jukebox or having a heated debate about the Middle East peace process. That one's up to you."}
{"text":"1 star for strong drinks.
1 star for fun jukebox.
1 star for Christmas lights
1 star for the giant tree in the middle."}
{"text":"One of my favorite State Street bars. Usually crowded on weekends, but it's a great group of people (grad students, young professionals, undergrads, out of towners). Drinks were nothing remarkable, but everything in this place is better because of the giant tree."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night between 5 and 6.  The ambiance and seating are nice - the decor is very inviting.  The staff, not so much.  You would think they would have someone working the floor if you have so much seating but alas, no.  The bartenders, when flagged down, made adequate drinks.  I think if there was a change in the staff and they put staff on the floor it could be much better."}
{"text":"Good jukebox!

Sometimes, the patrons are a little frat-ish / jelled hair types but good overall."}
{"text":"I have a lot better things to do than go into a bar that's big claim to fame is the fact that it has a big tree with a string of christmas lights on it.

I've been in here once, and once was enough.  If you are actually sitting in one of the few places to sit, all that means is that you are such a huge lush that you got there at 6 o'clock.  So, you can wipe that smirky look off your face, drunko."}
{"text":"Iconic bar downtown on state street, re-created to mirror the earlier version from down the street. Good beer selection, nice bartenders, gets really crowded at night. ATM machine, takes Credit cards."}
{"text":"From what I had heard, I thought this would be way more of a dive bar. Definitely not.  It had a nice feel and cute couches if you were lucky enough to get one.  However, the actual people who went there were a bit much.  If you have a bouncer, please escort the rowdy persons out.  I was sitting at the high top tables and a drunk patron kept running into me.  I ended up wearing half my drink.  The staff saw this and did nothing.  

Overall the rest of my experience was ok.  I liked the tree.  It is just kind of an average, everyday bar with a great tree.  

The bartenders were jerks.  Inattentive.  There was one with curly hair, she talked to me like I was an idiot.  From ordering to closing my tab, you would have thought I was speaking another language.  I doubt I will go back to Paul's."}
{"text":"I don't understand the allure of Paul's Club.   Wow, couches!  Ooooo, it has a tree in the middle!  OMGWTFBBQ.  That's soooo awesome!  

....Not.  

All that damn tree does is take up valuable bar space.  

It's not bad if you get there early and can actually use one of the 20+/- seats in the place.  Otherwise, there's nowhere to stand, and you're A) constantly being knocked into by people who, understandably, want to get to the bar, and B) being stared and snarked at by the people sitting on the couches who are oh-so-much better than you.

BUT, if you get there early, it's not too bad.  Strong drinks, reasonable prices, music's okay, bartenders are okay.... it's just the atmosphere that starts around 9pm.  Ick!"}
{"text":"I dislike Paul's Club quite a bit.  The service staff is beyond rude.  Their drinks are fairly cheap, but the service staff is working with their nose stuck up in the air.  A friend was there chilling with another friend just having some drinks, and then the bartender starts threatening to kick them out for looking at the crowd.  They were TOLD to face forward at the bar.  If I'm going to go to a bar to have a few drinks and people watch, what's it to the bartender?  I've also heard numerous stories about them screwing up the checks with overcharging and what not.  It's a pretty shoddy business."}
{"text":"It's kinda bad. The drinks are crazy slow to the point where it's frustrating and when then finally come they're weak"}
{"text":"I like Paul's club.  I like the tree, I like the stiff drinks.  The beer selection leaves some to be desired.  Its best when you can get a seat, weekdays might be best in that regards.  None the less a good State Street joint."}
{"text":"I like Paul's. There's a tree. It's a very fake tree, but it's a tree just the same. Feels like a deciduous Rainforest Cafe when you use your imagination.

I overheard a lady telling her friend that the tree was a real tree she'd heard, and how did they get it in there?  Heavens to Betsy. All you have to do is look at it to see it's fake. Some people. Oy.

The drinks here are not expensive, but they're not dirt cheap either ($7 mixed rail drink--at 5:50pm--which I consider Happy Hour). You might have to wait a minute or five anytime after 6:30pm, but the service is good and the bathroom is clean.

I like sitting in the comfy areas along the wall, though these are not often available when I get there, so I tend to stand and glower a bit and stare at said seating areas until my friends decide they're ready to move on to a place with chairs.

As far as I know, there's no food. Not even little nibbles to calm your nerves or settle your tum before dinner.

This is the place I come before a show at the Overture, but unless it's summertime and I want a pineapple cider on the patio, there are other places I'd rather be.

Everyone loves a tree though."}
{"text":"The bouncer said my ID was fake and kicked me out. Ridiculous and silly. Never going back."}
{"text":"This place gets five stars from me for the sole distinction of having my favorite drink - the Negroni. Every other bar that I've been to has them, except for the ones in Madison. Until now!

Even if you're not a Negroni drinker, you will like the drinks here. Probably the most important thing is that the drinks are not watered down. Their well liquor is of good quality, and their pours are of good size. Plus they have a tree in the middle of their bar!

I will be going there much more often. Maybe you'll find me at the bar with my favorite drink."}
{"text":"the tree in the restaurant gives a good vibe.  Sometimes gets a little crowded, but i remember drinking pretty good bottled beer there."}
{"text":"Drove up to Madison from Chicago to see Skrillex on a Monday night. Had a few drinks before and after the show and the staff was amazing and so attentive. They had an incredible beer selection for really affordable prices. Thank god they were right next to the Orpheum to end an outstanding night! Thanks guys! Next time I'm in Madison, I will absolutely come back to the bar with a real live tree growing inside!"}
{"text":"Went there after a concert with a couple friends for a drink. Nice place however the tall male bartender with glasses was extremely rude.  For being not very busy service was also slow.  Bouncer at the door was very nice though.  Had a good time despite the poor service.  Hopefully they can find a decent bartender."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It is one of my favorite places to go downtown.  I love the atmosphere and I love the bartenders!!!  They make a great drink and have a great selection of liquor and beer!  I always have a great time!!! Love, love, love it here!!!"}
{"text":"When Paul's Club first moved, I wasn't completely sold. For years I've been referring to it as \"Bizarro Paul's Club\" because they took a bulk of the old location's interior and moved it, but in a mirror image of the old place. The bar was wider, and while the extra space was appreciated, everything looked just slightly out of place. The clientele on many of my first visits was also a little different than how I remembered Paul's - these newbies were young, loud, and the best of bros (aka the worst of bros). 

On my last visit, I was really pleasantly surprised. Patrons were chill, and most seemed to be a party who was potlucking and watching the Packer game. The average age had gone up by a decade. Paul's had replaced many of their old, green chairs with ridiculously comfy black ones. They were low to the ground, but fit my short frame as well as my 6-foot-plus friend's. I can't say I didn't entertain the idea of trying to drag one out of the bar without anyone noticing and putting it in my apartment. 

It's true that Paul's has changed, but I've now found the right night to visit for what I want Paul's to be - a cozy hangout spot where I can be psuedo-classy."}
{"text":"THE TREE IS NOT REAL...I REPEAT THE TREE IS NOT REAL!

For the last three years I have been listening about the cool bar with the tree growing in the middle of it.  So this year I decided to go with them to see that tree...only to find out it was fake.  The sad part is that one of the guys is from Oregon and he should know trees...they hug trees there.  I tried to get the bartender to settle our dispute but he just stood there and smiled.  The smile seemed to lean towards plastic tree...dont get me wrong it looks cool and real but then when you realize the tree is growing out of the middle of a bar with a roof over the top it starts to get a little suspicious.

Okay enough about the fake tree...Paul's Club is a cool little bar with great beer prices...I love Madison.  Such a cute downtown with out the crowds of a major city.  I will definately come back here for a few drinks in the future and relax under the shade of Paul's Big Fake Rubber Tree!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fun! Who couldn't like a bar on the main drag in Madison that has a huge tree in the middle of it?  Beer list is ok, but the laid back vibe of the place makes up for it!"}
{"text":"This was one of my regular hangouts when I lived just off the Capitol Square 20+ years ago. I remember it being a chill place especially for a college bar, so I decided to stop in and see if my memory served me correctly. I'm pleased to say that it did.

First things first for UW alumni and other old-timers taking a similar stroll down memory lane: no, your memory isn't faulty. Yes, the bar and the tree are now on the opposite wall from where you remember; yes, the space is a little bigger than you remember; and yes, they are on the other side of the Orpheum. It turns out some years ago they moved a few doors to the east after a lease dispute or something like that. The new digs are nicer, more spacious, and an all-around better place for a tree lounge.

So anyway... yeah, this is still a chill bar with a chill lounge-type vibe and a great tap selection, mostly free of jocks or meatheads or sorority trixies barely able to stand. That said, it's still a college bar and not really a place middle-aged folks would add to their regular nightlife rotation unless they want to feel really old and out of place. And on a busy Friday or Saturday night, even the most laid-back college bar is bound to have that one chumbolone who thinks Jim Beam is his Cobra Kai sensei. Sure enough, that chumbolone sat right next to me and did his level best to bait me. Sorry kid, my booze-fueled brawling days are well behind me -- next time go to Kollege Klub and try someone younger and stupider. Fortunately a nearby bouncer was keeping an eye on the situation.

Overall still a nice place with a laid-back vibe and (mostly) laid-back clientele... but still a place for the college crowd.  So if your age starts with anything other than a \"2,\" stop by, have a couple drinks, take a short walk down Memory Lane, and move along."}
{"text":"This place is really cool! OK so the tree may be fake but it's unique enough to attract a great diverse crowd. I came out on a Saturday night with a friend while I was visiting Madison and just got a really nice vibe from Paul's. It's loud and bustling, but not douchey. People let you get to the bar to order (miracle!). I'd definitely head back to Paul's next time I'm in town. Great prices as well!"}
{"text":"I am an out-of-towner, just in Madison for a wedding so we did State Street bar hopping to get the feel for the school and the city.  

Paul's was full of college kids and was a little too packed for my old-lady likings when we first got there.
With patience though, seats opened up quickly and we had an entire couch area to ourselves.  Drinks were reasonably priced (I'm from Seattle so everything in Madison was practically free in my opinion) and the decor was really cool.  The tree is awesome.  

I would go here again, if we weren't so drunk the night of the wedding I'm sure we would have returned..hahaha!!"}
{"text":"My first experience at Paul's left such a positive impression that to this day, Paul's remains my number one Madison bar.

I'm not sure what the present situation is, but throughout my undergraduate career Paul's (along with Brothers) was one of those places where you do not *dare* try to get in to unless you are 21.  So imagine the utter happiness I felt when on a random Tuesday night, 19-year-old-Leslie was allowed in, no hassel, where I proceeded to live it up Paul's style drinking rail gin and tonics and talking liberal-banter for several hours with two good friends whom I hadn't seen since a volunteer trip the Mexico the year before.  

Let me put this out there: Paul's is busy over the weekend.  Worse, over the summer, the weekend crowd is surprisingly similar to that of Brat's (how that happened, I have no idea).  It smells kind of weird because the floor is carpeted.  

With that out of the way, Sunday-Thursday Paul's Club is the place to be to chill with friends and grab a drink, either to start out or end the night.  It's the kind of place where you'll bump into someone totally random whom you really like but don't get around to seeing very often.  And it has a tree that's always lit with white lights."}
{"text":"I came. I saw. I touched the mummified tree. Then had a drunk college guy spill a drink all over me. I knew there was a reason I stayed away from State Street. The one redeeming quality to the place is the tap list: very solid."}
{"text":"THIS BAR HAS A GIANT TREE IN IT!! Do I really need to say anything else?

Okay, if I do, it also has leather seats you'll sink into, cheap drinks and friendly bartenders. Cya there!"}
{"text":"The drinks are strong and reasonable for state street but the furniture could use a facelift. I sat down and almost spilled my drink as my ass practically hit the floor and a puff of dust blew up around me. I felt like Pig Pen from the Peanuts. After about 20 minutes my eyes started to itch and my nose was stuffed. 

I'll be back for the stiff drinks and the atmosphere. Oh they had a nice variety of beer too!"}
{"text":"I don't know why people are so confused by the tree. It does not matter if it's real or fake (it's fake) but it's an interesting aspect of the bar!! The drinks are stiff and reasonably priced. Highly recommend their old fashioned (with woodford reserve, of course; it was one of the best old fashioneds id had ever!"}
{"text":"For a first few visits, I liked this place. I had my first encounter with Jageer-bomb experience (what a fine night it was), I have forgotten to reclaim my credit card here and had to come back with an embarrassing face on Sunday, I faked an accident and felt some random guy's ass .. you get the picture, this is not a very classy place. But good enough to have fun. Bartenders do make good drink. One exception is their orange jouce-vodka-redbull shot. It's supposed to be their house shot, but I'm begging you, do not try this. It tastes worse than cough medicine, and you'll regret about not getting Jager-bomb instead. 

The decor is that of the typical undergrad bar. Old looking carped and some couches and chairs. On the weekends, it tends to get very crowded with college kids. So if you are looking for a college aged kids hang-outs, this is one of them, and you might love the un-pretentious atmosphere. 

For me, I felt a need to move on after a while. I figured that the tree will never grow, but I'm growing older."}
{"text":"Last week I met some friends at Paul's Club. I never go to bars downtown but this was a special request. We had a really nice time and split our time evenly between sitting indoors and outdoors. It wasn't too busy and the mood was very casual. The bartender was friendly and he made me a perfect brandy old fashion! Even though I do not like going downtown I might make an exception and try Paul's club again.:)"}
{"text":"This is State Street's hidden gem for over 50 years.  Great micro brews on tap, whiskeys, bourbons, and bloody mary's. It is a great place to watch the game or sit out on their patio.  If  you are headed to downtown Madison this is a place you must hit up.  It was also selected as one of Wisconsin's Top 10 bars:  http://bestthingswi.com/bars/"}
{"text":"I knew it was love when I came here, saw the tree, and Cake was playing. The crowd here is awesome and they have great drinks. Although it isn't as cheap as the bro-bars on University, you can still have a better time with a nicer crowd and better microbrews. The bartenders are also super nice."}
{"text":"Any place known as the \"tree club\" I've gotta see, and the first thing I asked the bouncer at the door was whether or not the tree was real. Apparently, it is! It was cut down a few decades ago and then...I'm assuming, reconstructed? in the center of the club.  They also spray the leaves periodically with some sort of chemical to keep them green. Basically a mummified tree. COOOOL. Good enough for me. I'm not here for the tree.

Pros:
Full bar.  
Good selection of ciders. 
Nice, fun crowd.

Con: 
Awkwardly narrow and elongated bar/seating area - if you don't have a big enough group to fill up an entire table, you will be sharing it with another group. Be prepared for a night of awkward stares and unintentional eavesdropping."}
{"text":"Compared to week nights vs weekends Paul's Club almost seems like two different bars.  The week nights Paul's Club presents itself as a nice quieter bar for drinks and conversation.  On the weekends, especially later in the evening (i.e. after 10pm) Paul's Club tends to be a nice bar but chances for a conversation are hit or miss, as it gets very crowded and very loud.  Reasons to go anyways: perhaps you'll get a seat and the beer selection is wonderful. Also they tend to mix some strong effing drinks, and obnoxious frat dudes are sparse.  Paul's Club always has this unusual smell, it smells like a swimming pool. My vote is that it is some chemical to sanitize their carpets. (Yes, a carpeted bar.. eeh)  However if you find yourself bored at Paul's Club you and your drinking buddies can speculate what exactly that smell is.  Also if you are a beer person, Paul's Club is one of the few bars in Madison that serves snake bites, which is a lovely pint glass with 1/2 Guinness and 1/2 Hard Cider.  It's quite tasty"}
{"text":"I'm from Nyc so I'm used to rude people but the blonde woman who is working there this evening takes the cake. I just walked in to ask if they get really busy on Sunday nights (we're in town with Kinky Boots and I was hoping to have the cast get drinks there after for our last show).  Granted, they were setting up for the evening but this woman scoffed at me and said she \"didn't know\" and then walked away. Later I heard her say under her breath that that was a dumb question. When I confronted her about she said again that it was a dumb question. Is it really that dumb? I've been a server so I get it can suck but I have NEVER treated a customer or potential customer that way. I hope that lady can brush off whatever she's going through because it's really bad business."}
{"text":"Stopping here for a cocktail with my friend was a bit disorientating. The last time I was at Paul\"s was 10 years ago. It has moved and flipped to be a mirror image. The bartender was a great help telling us where we should go next.  We were in early so it was quiet and easy to get the low down on the local night life, and a bit of history as well. He also makes a mean drink. 
 I highly recommend a stop by Paul's if your a bit older like me maybe earlier in the evening. It is a collage town."}
{"text":"Paul's Club is not your typical I wanna get sloshed bar when I was in undergrad.  It was the cool, 'swanky' if you will type of drinking establishment.  More for your 5th year senior.

When you walk in it's super dark inside, carpeted (unusual for a bar), loungy couches, and a HUGE FREAKIN TREE in the middle of the place.  Christmas lights round out the cozy vibe along with a killer jukebox.  

Paul's Club most definitely serves up tasty drinks, nice variety of beers, and the BEST Bloody Mary I have ever had.  Try it!  Seriously."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite bar I visited during my trip to Madison.  How can you not love a tree in the middle of a bar astrewn with Christmas lights?  Right there, it's five stars.  But on top of that the bartendars were the BEST.  Seriously, the bartendar was always one step ahead of me -- was already mixing up the second drink before I put my hand up for another & constantly refilling my water glass before I even needed to ask.  I wish I could transport this place to LA."}
{"text":"it gets so damn crowded in there, you almost feel like not drinking anymore.  if work gets you down and you want to hit a afternoon drink afore the dullards take to the streets in mass, this is an excellent place.  if you want the experience of being shipped to america in a cargo container with 89 other refugees, wait until friday night to head to paul's club."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks, cool atmosphere with the tree in the middle of the bar. Decent prices and a lot of beers on tap. Great place to sit around with friends in the comfy chairs and chat. I went on a Sunday night, so it wasn't very crowded or loud. I've heard that it gets pretty packed on Friday/Saturday nights and can sometimes have more of a club-like atmosphere."}
{"text":"I frequent this establishment quite often. It is a fun relaxed place to get some drinks with friends and has some of the most comfortable couches. Calling the bartenders mixologists would be a stretch but they make the cheap vodka go down like grey goose. 

The bartenders are all super friendly and always have great suggestions for places to eat and what other bars have specials right now. I came for the drinks but I keep coming back because  of the bartenders."}
{"text":"Went here with a certain Rebbe... I don't know what others are talking about when they say that the staff aren't up to their stuff. The staff I met during my first jaunt out in August were great and went out of their way to give me a replacement drink when my friend had a slip of the hand and ended up getting most of his drink on me..."}
{"text":"It's in a new spot now, so it's not really the same Paul's Club.  And by that I mean there's no more sticky carpet, seating held together by duct tape, and mandatory vertical spooning of strangers due to space limitations.  Whatever, get me a beer."}
{"text":"Cool bar - changed from last year - after noticing us staring at the walls dumbfounded they had moved and flipped the bar around..that was good news we thought we both had lost it. Just a cool dark place for drinks."}
{"text":"You know the Three Little Bears story?  One porridge is too hot, the other too cold, one just right?

It was like that on our State St. pub crawl.   HopCat was a bit slick;  Side Door had terrible acoustics;  Coopers we didn't even bother because it's so pricey.

But Paul's Club was just right.  A really satisfying range of beers at decent prices (the Victory Saison for $6 was super);   amazing, caring bartender who really went out of his way to make people happy;  a relaxing, cozy atmosphere with bar stools or cushy chairs, nice lighting, and a pleasant ambiance all around;  and then there's the tree.  You might just want to hug it when you go."}
{"text":"Paul's Club has always been one of my favorite places to get a few drinks and mingle with some fun people. There is always a diverse clientele here, and a few of my most memorable nights in Madison included a stop at Paul's Club.

The drinks are reasonably priced, and the bartenders are first rate. The place can be a bit tight due to the layout, but people here seem to be better at \"thinking thin\" and allowing you to slide past.

Part of my love of the place is the tree. I feel like I am in Sherwood Forest or sitting around the campfire, which is a nice dichotomy being in downtown Madison.

If you are claustrophobic or don't like crowded places, this is not your joint. Otherwise, give it a try."}
{"text":"Paul's Club is not for everyone but it has an environment I found very appealing.  It's atmosphere is inbetween a college bar and the middle-aged crowd, although you'll find some of both there depending on the night you go.  The bar reminds me a lot of the old lounge scenes you see in mafia movies or pool halls; older rimmed couches, dim lighting, talkative patrons, etc.  The music seems to vary based on the crowd too, as the jukebox usually controls it.  They have a nice selection of older hip-hop, rock, and folk, and drink prices are reasonable.  It's not a bar with a lot of frills, but if you're in the mood for something casual and conversational, Paul's Club is your place.  

I would be remiss if I didn't mention the tree.  Paul's Club has a tree in the middle of the bar, nothing fancy but it adds a little classic flavor that makes the bar distinguishable from others.  A friend of mine climbed it once, but I don't recommend doing this as he was promptly kicked out :) .  

If your going for the ideal atmosphere, I'd frequent it on a weekday night.  It's a nice Tuesday-Thursday bar to get over the hump of the week and catchup with old friends.  It tends to be too busy to find a seat on weekends, as is the case with a lot of state street bars."}
{"text":"This place seemed to have good potential because it felt real chill, but the music came out from a jukebox with a pretty limited selection of music.  In addition to that music albums and tracks were not correctly marked so the wrong song would come on.  Our group did have a good opportunity to chit chat and talk with each other without having to talk over the music and crowds of people, but then again school wasn't in session and it was a Tuesday night.  Drinks were average priced, but surprising that there weren't really specials going on.  The bartender seemed a little off, not returning my credit card until I reminded him - and there's a sign posted for a penalty for not closing your tab, like a charge or a fee."}
{"text":"Always a great time at this place!  Even though they don't serve food, they allow you to bring it in with no hassle.  The staff are very friendly and there is usually plenty of space to sit and chill with your friends.  Prices are a little high, but nothing so different than what you would find at other Madison bars."}
{"text":"Looking for a nice place for a drink or two on a weekday night?  Could do a lot worse than Paul's Club.  Tasty drinks (great Old Fashioned's) and a fake tree define Paul's Club.  Also a good jukebox and comfy chairs.  Stay away on Friday and Saturday nights though; too crowded."}
{"text":"Loooove Pauls Club!  Ive lived in Madison for a long time and after the college bar scene becomes old and you have to grow up, but don't really want to, Pauls is the place!  It has a nice, wide variety of people that come in, which always makes it different and fun.  
The bartenders are awesome and per the typical Paul's review--oh yeah.....there's a tree."}
