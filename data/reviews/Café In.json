{"text":"I tried coffee/espresso at a few places in the market, but this was decidedly better. Service was fast and friendly. In the summer they open up the front shutters and you can enjoy your tasty beverage in the shade and style people watch."}

{"text":"I think my friend is starting to love the Cafe Latte in Montreal... no for the coffee itself but for that rich milk froth...While we were walking around Marche Jean Talon, all she kept wanting was a coffee... that's how we ended up at Cafe In.  This place is crowded with table set so close together, I can barely move around with my winter jacket on... or maybe I ate too much bagels while I was in Montreal??  Service is quick and efficient... with this single barista running the place.   I just sipped on my black coffee while my friend when hmmm and ahhhhh with her frothy cafe latte... I really want to tell her how fattening that is......"}
