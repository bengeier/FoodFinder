{"text":"This place is great for a chicken & rice spot. The portions are ridiculous. The quality is not the best, but it makes up for that in price and portions. If you want a quick meal that will FILL you up and be easy on the wallet, this is your spot. I recommend adding extra eggs to your fried rice, yummy!"}
{"text":"Two thumbs down for the Orange Chicken! Fried Rice was just okay."}
{"text":"I saw all of the good reviews and decided to try this place. Not cr size portions but the food was pretty nasty tasting."}
{"text":"Good  tasty food.  Very cheap prices huge portions of food served. The restaurant is nice and cozy inside.  Expect great service every time you come here.  Just a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Great affordable price,
You can't beat the price
we always have leftovers
portions are huge
I have been to this place a few years ago but they changed owners 
I was a little hesitant to eat here because most chinese places are kinda pricey
I usually only eat chinese if it is a buffett (good price and lots of variety, all you can eat).
I heard they had a $2 teriyaki bowl,
I ordered it and it was so much food,
We go there about 2 times a week for lunch,
The food is ok.... Lo Mein was not that great but was only $1.65 small it was missing the usual veggie, cabbage carrots onions. But it was a lot of lo mein for a small.
Orange chicken was ok...I like Pandas better but Panda charges you $5 for a small bowl and I only paid $3.88 for small that was a lot bigger.
Chicken Katsu was really good, the sauces they make are delicious they have a chile sauce that is wonderful.
Crab puffs are amazing you can actually taste the crab. its not all filled with cream cheese like other places.
I love this place because its affordable and food is good."}
{"text":"Try Fried Rice #Zero #0
The ragoons tasted like Man goons!! 
Burnt chicken, lo mein tasted like stove gas..Disgusting food. Save your money!"}
{"text":"food is good. they give a lot of food. a lot of meat. not stungy at all. good ppl working there"}
{"text":"Really good food ,big portions decent price enough for lunch,dinner and breakfast. Friendly people and happy work here."}
{"text":"Probably the most food I've seen in my entire life! HUGE portions, seriously huge portions. It was decent tasting, their fried rice was the best. Wouldn't bother coming back."}
{"text":"The only reason for the 3rd  is because of the portion sizes,  otherwise it's 2. Its good, average chinese food.  Reminds of of Flaming Wok in the mall.  Spaghetti noodles for lo mein.  Everything over sauced. Shrimp dishes were just bad.  Tasted old and flavorless. Portions are huge. So its good to have for a few days,  but I wouldn't want to."}
{"text":"Both my husband and I had a upset stomach after eating a meal from here. Prices were great but not worth getting sick again"}
{"text":"Not fancy for sure. Having said that if you need to feed a  crowd this is your jam. The Chinese is Cantonese. The portions are GIANT.  Definitely need to share. The prices a beyond reasonable. A must stop in T Town."}
{"text":"If I could put no stars I would!! This place is disgusting! I'm not even over exaggerating when I say half my plate was full of oil! When I went to take a bite of my fried rice it looks like it was soupy  but in actuality it was oil. The guy also stopped my brother when he was throwing out our tray and asked him what sauces that we didn't use and actually grab them off the tray and put them back onto the tray of other sauces he had on the counter. I was disgusted & will never go back!! BEWARE!!!!"}
{"text":"The good, and only reason it isn't one star...the portions are HUGE and price is CHEAP. Three people could eat off the Chicken Fried Rice.

The not so good...the fried rice is tasteless. Tastes like white rice with peas and carrots, no flavor other than that. Teriyaki chicken should be small/thin slices of chicken that have been char broiled with teriyaki sauce put on afterwards. Not huge chunks of poor quality meat that have been soaked in something turning the meat red and then heated with no char. The color of the meat here is due to whatever it was soaked in and not due to the cooking method.

Drove a long ways to eat here and was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, huge portions, cheaper than any other place, and decent service. I would give them 5 stars, but I'm only giving 4 because it took 30 min for my food to be ready (called ahead by 15 min, had to wait an additional 15 min there. Sucks when you only get a 30 min lunch :( ) and the last time I paid for extra veggies, none were added. I called them on it, they claim it was in there. Nope. Not a huge deal,  it was .50, but don't argue with a repeat customer over it, especially when I take a picture of the dish, and it clearly shows a lack of the addition."}
{"text":"We ordered orange chicken, chicken fried rice, pork fried rice and chicken with shrimp and the spicy chicken wings.  The portions are huge!! Would have ordered the small but didn't notice they had small until after I ordered and paid....The kids and wife liked their dishes, however mine was the orange chicken. It was horrible to say it nicely. It was over fried and the orange sauce was awful.  I tried the other dishes and they were ok at best.  The spicy wings were the best items served and they were not bad.  My luck had it that my fortune cookie had none.  I was very disappointed because this place actually has good reviews and other family members did recommend this place.  So who knows, maybe a real off day for the cooks."}
{"text":"It's not fancy food, but it's good food, huge portions, and great prices."}
{"text":"OMG worst Chinese food ever.  I'm so sorry but whoever said this is good food has no tastebuds.  We stopped to try it because this place always have people.  So we thought it was because it has good food.  But oh we were so wrong.  To start with, place is dirty and outdated. But we were like; what Chinese restaurant isn't.  So we ignored it.  When we got there there were three families eating and they looked very pleased with their food.  So we went to order.  We got orange chicken, chicken katsu, chicken teriyaki, pork fried rice, shrimp tempura and noodles.  The only dish that was actually eatable was the rice. Everything else was just BAD.  The only star goes to service and to the Thai tea.  Never would we come back to this place."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Went there with my family and we all got the chicken teriyaki and it was sooooooooooo good and the amount of food for the price was amazing... Im not sure if that's the normal or what but it was like we each got a whole friggin chicken. So good and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"So happy I found this restaurant. I live all the way in East Mesa and this place is definitely worth the drive. Super cheap Chinese food that is pretty darn tasty to me. I understand that not everyone will agree on flavor but this has, by far, got to be the best value I've come across since moving to Arizona. I've pretty much accepted that good Chinese food out here is relatively nonexistent but this place sets a new standard. 

The guy who works at the register is super nice. Their is a slight language barrier but he can take your order with ease. Just don't be one of those customers with 100 questions about the food content because you may have trouble understanding the responses. Besides, 1) That's tacky and 2) there are pictures EVERYWHERE. What you see is what you get."}
{"text":"Okay, so here's the low down, this place is AWESOME! I ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl for $2 and an appetizer combo (3 vegetable spring rolls and a large drink) for $2.28 and paid a whopping $4.64 with tax for lunch. This lunch could feed two easily. The chicken teriyaki bowl is real recognizable big chunks of chicken breast. I think there is probably 3 chicken breasts in this bowl, and a ton of rice. At first the spring rolls caught me off guard because they were small, but they pack a delicious punch, so don't let the size fool you. The teriyaki sauce is better than most places and it just can't be beat for a gigantic meal for under $5."}
{"text":"So I went back a couple more times and I've come to the conclusion that their food is actually really good."}
{"text":"Here's the low down..got the house lo mein and chicken fried rice, just like everyone else has said, large portions for the price, but in order to get 5 stars, it has to taste at least, really good..it was okay and honestly, I don't know if that's really chicken..it was a lil on the greasy side, but decent in a pinch, especially if you're hungry"}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU ARE EXPECTING CHINESE FOOD! Husband and I came here cause he loves Chinese food every now and then... Big disappointment! Yes their food portions are generous, I would say some items on their menu are a great deal, but the food was nothing like we expected. We ordered orange chicken. Sauce was a bright orange and tasted like something out of a cheap bottle, served with mushy white rice. Good portioned but I suppose the reason everyone in other reviews had leftovers were because it wasn't good enough to eat! Lol also had the spicy beef with white rice HUGE portion only to eat a quarter of it between the two of us. Very charred tasting. Need was very thin and fatty. The flavor of the food is OKAY! Not Chinese though. Also had the spicy chicken (breaded) with rice. This I would say was the best out of the three. Again, their food isn't terrible but it shouldn't be in the Chinese food category. And it is a little unique tasting. We won't be coming back. Just not our kind of place. Staff was friendly though. Place was clean. We spent $18 on the three items plus a Coke. Not worth it for us. We don't mind spending the money but we hate to be disappointed :("}
{"text":"WOW! The reviews were not wrong. The $2 Teriyaki Chicken Bowl is HUGE! It's plenty to feed two kids. We ordered one for each of our kids, and will have leftovers for 1-2 more meals. My husband and I shared a Large Chicken Fried Rice and had more than enough for him to take for lunch the next day. Friendly owners."}
{"text":"Today was beef broccoli with low mein, bada bing!!!!Delicious as usual , great price."}
{"text":"First time! Great service, HUGE portions for a very great price. These ayes will probably be my lunch and dinner for the next two days. Lol. Jk. Lots of flavor and it taste oh so fresh! Only thing I can really say is I absolutely love that they give so much food! It's amazing. I would totally recommend this place and stop by again."}
{"text":"This is mall court style Chinese at its finest. The portions are massive and the price is low. The food is not HIGH quality but it isn't LOW quality either. I love this place and stop by from time to time for cheap tasty food. The service is friendly and great people seem to forget there are different cultures and mistake cultural differences as rude."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience with their food as well as their service. I placed the order online and the food was supposed to be ready in 20 minutes. However it took 1 hour over the original 20 mins to get the food. 
At the home when I tried the food, it tasted disgusting and stale. Rangoons tasted rancid, the egg drop soup had clumps of hard boiled eggs in it. The chicken was old and gummy. I threw all the food away and food was not fresh. #Avoid"}
{"text":"Love be this place ! Found it on here and always order online . Huge portions for the price and haven't been disappointed. They always have the food ready on time and with all the condiments even if you don't order them! Fast, friendly and easy ! And super cheap!!"}
{"text":"First timer! I choose to do a pick up order through the app. 

Wow I didn't realize how big the plates were gonna be, there was so much food! If you're on a budget your dollar will go a long way here!

As for the taste, it was okay. It didn't really stand out. The lomein was a bit too oily. 

I would still recommend this place though, can't beat the price for the amount of food you get!"}
{"text":"When you are on a budget this is the places to hit up. I ordered the large chicken teriyaki plate. It was less than 10$ but enough for 5 people. The tasted is ok. Some may like it some may not. But for the price, you really can't complain to much. Even if you are a picky eater."}
{"text":"You get a lot of food, but it is bland and lacking in flavor.  Also, be careful in the parking lot because it's not well lit and your bumper could get hung up on the nails sticking out of the concrete blocks.  We won't be back to this place.  Becky"}
{"text":"My wife just ate there for lunch and she was blown away by the price and the food.  I haven't even eaten there and I am giving it 5 stars because my wife is so happy.  We will go for dinner tonight and I will update my rating if it is not 5 stars.  However, I know if will be and because my gorgeous wife is so happy, I am sure it will be a fantastic evening worthy of 6 stars and 2 thumbs up.  For this place to be able to offer so much delicious food at such a low price, it must be a magical place.  How can you give anything less than 5 stars to a magical place like this.  Unless you are a troll from Goodyear who thinks that big chunks of chicken is a bad thing.  Then you just stay under your bridge handing out two star reviews, hoping people will kiss your butt because you are a world renowned food critic that lives in friggen Goodyear Az.  So get your butt out to #1 fried rice and see why it lives up to its name."}
{"text":"Prices are amazing and the portions are ridiculously large. Food is delicious as well"}
{"text":"Value, value value.  Don't expect the most articulated dishes here.  It's just simple, heavy, comfort food.  One large serving can probably serve 3 people.  It feels like Last Vegas inside with all the lights.  Avoid the noodles as it is too greasy."}
{"text":"It's three stars just for the fact that it's a LOT of food for the price. I personally didn't like the flavor, neither did my husband. We actually only ate VERY LITTLE and threw the rest away.  We ordered the LoMein, crunchy shrimp and orange chicken."}
{"text":"This place is great! I ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl, it is $2.00!! And it is HUGE!!!! Seriously, share it. I couldn't even eat half of it. The food is also really good! I was very impressed at the quality of the food and especially for the price! Try it out!"}
{"text":"Ordered fried shrimp and noodles. Big mistake! It was Disgusting. Fried shrimp was drenched in a white sauce that tasted like mayonnaise, and the shrimp tasted like cardboard. Noodles ok but so greasy with the mayo sauce all over. Disappointed to say the least. Will not be returning. Waste of $$."}
{"text":"Found this little place via Yelp. The people working here were so sweet and gracious. The food was super yummy. Prices were crazy cheap and portions were HUGE! I am not sure how they can afford to give out such big portions for so inexpensive. 

We got the 'family value meal' it was $19.99. Comes with your choice of 3 full sized entrees, lo mien or rice (for each item!),  8 vegetable spring rolls AND 2 large drinks. We also got the Chicken teriyaki and rice dish, which was $2!! And then the 6 piece Crab and cream cheese wontons, $2.88.

There were 5 of us. We paid $26.17 and we have enough food for a whole other meal!!! 

Amazing. This would be a regular place for us if we didn't live over 100 miles away. 

Seriously, try it! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Visited here over lunch and ordered a fairly basic beef fried rice, my colleague ordered the same. Price appeared reasonable and we had heard good things from others. As we sat down we noticed others around us becoming impatient and one of the groups indicated they had been waiting over an hour for their food. We didn't think much of it until we found ourselves sitting around for 35 minutes waiting for our order... At that point the groups ahead of us were requesting refunds. We didn't want to waste anymore time and went elsewhere without attempting to get a refund... $8 wasted but a lesson learned."}
{"text":"#1 Fried Rice reminds me of Chinese food that I grew up eating in New Jersey. Good food in HUGE portions and ridiculously affordable, that combination can't be beat!

Everything I have tried from their menu has not disappointed. My absolute favorite is the chicken katsu with fish fillets (humongous) sub fried rice. I have enough food to last me for several meals. Aside from their delicious fish fillets, their food is your typical Chinese takeout. I would still keep coming because I love being able to pay less than $7 for 3 lbs of food!"}
{"text":"The food just is not good. We tried the orange chicken and the chicken teriyaki and it was a level above disgusting. The service was also slow. The guy at the front looks like he has never seen a computer before. The best thing was the portions. They are very generous with that but it won't matter since it's no good. Be careful with tolleson cops."}
{"text":"Chicken Katsu, teriyaki chicken,  fried rice, shrimp and fish!! Very good food, hidden gem.  Very clean and fresh. The portion is very generous, must try."}
