{"text":"This is a restaurant we've been wanting to try for years. I wish we had tried it sooner! This is one of the best Indian buffets my husband and I have been to in the city. There is wide variety of dishes each time, including a nice little salad bar. The dessert selection is small, but it has varied each time...and really, by the end, one doesn't have room for dessert after sampling delicious samosas, pakora, butter chicken and curry. The atmosphere is friendly and we quite enjoy talking to the owner who has a lot of pride in his restaurant and food. We'll always be back!"}
{"text":"Expensive Buffet, Not worth the $18 you pay per adult. Very simple food choice and Indian food cooked are very simple easy too cook dishes, ..
I went there with a coupon from Entertainment Book..I was told that would accept it for buffet..but after dinner with 6 friends was told they cannot give me any off as Buffet is excluded....damn...Will avoid it in future..Much better choices of Indian food in NE Calgary.
The place is small and not many people in there when I visited it few days ago."}
{"text":"We've been eating at many different Indian restaurants in the city, and by far Samosa Grill has the best food.  We love the buffet, and they have a KILLER naan bread!.

Definitely our favourite Indian cuisine!"}
{"text":"Samosa Grill has great vegetarian fare as well as regular buffet items.

The owner is a brilliant woman whose taste and style are reflected in the decor  and the presentation of the food.   

A fusion of African and Indian cuisines, the large triangular oil fried Samosas come in various flavours.  The vegetarian is very good and quite spicy.

There was at one time a Nov. 11 buffet that was absolutely wonderful and very well worth the value.

However, there is no wheelchair access and the stairs going up to the second floor location could be a trial for an elderly patron or someone with a difficulty walking up stairs.

On each occasion, we've had a different experience of the Samosa Grill and will go back from time to time when we want a little more elegance than our kitchen table."}
{"text":"Once again, per my other Indian reviews, this review focuses on the buffet only.  I love Indian buffets for the variety, the price, and the speed at which I can move curry into my stomach.  Samosa Grill is one of the best.

I have been to Samosa Grill several times (I've lost count).  We've enjoyed their normal buffet as well as their seafood buffet.  I strongly recommend both.  The food is always tasty and fresh.  It could do with being spicier, as their buffets are very tame.  This is normal though, as most Indian buffets cater to Western customers who usually don't like it spicy.

You'll find the usual favourites, such as Butter Chicken, unless you go during a seafood night.  I really enjoy the seafood buffet and would suggest going if you want to try something a little bit different.  But Samosa Grill is not without it's problems.

Samosa Grill is one of the many Indian restaurants that serve naan bread to your table and don't include it on the buffet table.  This drives me crazy, as you usually have to wait for it to be made, which can sometimes not come until well into your second helping.  I go to Indian buffets because I don't want to wait, and I'm usually starving.

The other issue is service.  This seems to be common during buffets at even the best Indian restaurants.  It's frustrating.  I've had to order my drink several times, wait patiently for water, and sit around wanting to pay with nobody in sight.  If this was my one and only Indian buffet experience, this review would likely only get 3 stars.  But since poor service has been a common and consistent experience at every Indian restaurant, but one, I have to give 4 stars.  As for that one restaurant that would get 5 stars, sadly they went out of business a few months ago."}
