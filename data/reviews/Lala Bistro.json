{"text":"Great little Polish restaurant.  With the help of Yelp, I was able again to win big with my parents on another \"meat & potato\" spot that we all liked.  We were very lucky to have Gillian K and her BF Brian J join us.  It was a fun, filling evening!  Lala Bistro is a small spot, and thankfully still seems quite busy in the midst of the crazy Roncesvalles construction.    Amonst the table, we had a good sampling of the menu.  My mom and I shared the Farmers platter which consisted of pork cutlet, cabbage rolls, pierogies, mashed potatoes, Polish sausage, pickled beets......a feast that was huge!  The cabbage rolls were really, really good.  The meat to rice ratio was perfect.  I also really liked the Polish sausage.  It had a great smoky exterior and was nice and mild.  It would be great in the summer on a big but with some strong mustard.  The prices, so good.  For 3 mains, 1 platter, 5 pops and 2 soups - it wasn't even $90!  The waitress was very attentive and helpful.  If you are ever in the area and are looking for some good Polish food....for sure, pop on in."}
{"text":"I love pierogies, those little pouches of sin, so of course I was drawn to the 6$ Pierogie Plate sign hanging outside this place.  Inside, the vibe was...interesting. The service was good, nice, but I literally did not understand a single word any of the other customers and staff were speaking around me. They were all speaking Polish and all I could do was smile and sort of shrug if they looked my way. It was one of those great Toronto moments where you feel transported to another land through the power of the city's diversity. Awesome!  I can't speak for the rest of the food, but the pierogies were great, served with sour cream (is there any other way??) and vinegar coleslaw. Deeeee-licious."}
{"text":"This is not my favorite Polish restaurant on Roncesvalles, but it's not bad.  I walked by one day and saw someone sitting on the patio out front drinking a Polish beer called Tatra.  Almost no one in North American will have heard of it, but I promise you it's to die for.  I originally tried it when I was living in England, and also in Poland. It became one of my favorite beers which, upon returning to Canada I sadly realized I couldn't find anywhere. I actually stopped to talk to the guy and rambled something like \"Tatra is the best!\" and he looked at me as if I had lost my mind.  Polish people take good beer for granted.  Since then, I have been into Lala Bistro several times, each time asking the server 'Where do you get the Tatra?  I've never seen it in an LCBO.\"  Unfortunately they weren't able to pin point a location, but the good old LCBO website came through in the pinch.  Bloor & Runnymede - Hurray!  But about the restaurant itself, other than having amazing beers, it has a cozy and clean atmosphere.  Their entrees are a bit pricier than other places on Roncesvalles, but are well prepared.  I have had the schnitzel on several occasions, and salmon once.  Salmon was obviously from frozen, and  lacking in taste as frozen fish tends to do. But the schnitzel is absolutely top notch.  I've also had breakfast there several times, which is amazingly cheap.  You can go to Sunrise Grill up the street, and pay $9 for an omelette, which is admittedly huge, but here you can get a perfectly good omelette for less than $6.  Another nice point about this restaurant is that they will customize things for you.  Their menu says plain omelette, but one day it came with all these sliced up bell peppers, mushrooms, and cheese in it.  Sweet!  Now I ask for that every time.  I'm sure you could probably ask them to put whatever you want in the omelette, and they would hook you up. Plus they have espresso, which scores them some additional points.    They're very tolerant of you hanging out for hours using their free, and speedy WI-FI.  It is the best place I've found for Wi-FI on Roncesvalles.  All the other coffee places are either jam packed, or don't have sufficient tables. For example,  I officially hate Tinto Coffee House.  They are always closed, or over-crowded."}
