{"text":"An amazing hidden gem for hungry people who have a hankering for chef quality meals at lunch and dinner. Quite literally the best turkey sandwich I've ever eaten in my life! (Sorry mom). Call your order in to pick up as they have counter service. Specials listed on FB daily and they carry Norka!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here today, for lunch, and had one of the best salads of my life, the Texacan. It was more than I needed although I ate the whole darn thing anyway. I added grilled chicken to it for a protein. Delicious!"}
{"text":"A very cute place! In Hudson, I frequent Heartwood Roasters coffee, which is located next door. I wandered into The Fork and Knife after, of course, getting a coffee. Their cute sign outside lured me in! 

The Fork And Knife is adorable. There are literally two small tables inside and a few tables outside, so don't put all your cards on coming to eat here. They have a small but nice menu of salads, sandwiches, and a wrap or two for lunch. I ordered two sandwiches to-go, the Turkey and the Chicken Salad. The turkey was super yummy, and I loved the asparagus and dijon mustard on it. My sandwich, and my Dad's, both felt like they were made by a friend who just happens to be a good chef. That's the best kind!

The inside has a really welcoming vibe. They have walls of local products ranging from teas to honey and pasta. I love when businesses support other businesses like that! They also do a dinner special, where once a week (I think) they make something from scratch in large batches and sell plates until they sell out. The gal helping me recommended calling ahed of time to reserve your plate(s). When I visited, it was the Chicken Paprikas & Rolled Spaetzle (side note, that's the sure way to this German girl's heart). Totally loved this place, I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing here.  Make sure to pre-order your meals for the evening so they do. It run out.  We have ordered several meals to take home during the week and they all have been awesome.  They use quality local ingredients to make homemade meals, why even try cooking?!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing hidden gem.. go there immediately if you haven't! It's across from Yours Truly, further back than Peace Love and Little Donuts. My husband, son and I went there. I had an amazing turkey sandwich with artichoke pesto, asparagus, arugula that was dressed in a little lemon dressing, with provolone on focaccia. My husband had an amazing tuna salad sandwich and they offered my son a PB sandwich or mac and cheese. Mac and cheese was excellent! They had some indoor seating and a cute little patio, which is where we sat. Will definitely be going back here soon!"}
