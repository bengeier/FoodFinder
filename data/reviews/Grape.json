{"text":"Wednesday, 4/20 ... Great food! Great Service!!! Great wine!!!! Jes and I coming back for sure.

Marissa, our server was awesome. 

Regarding Frank R's comments and low score, sounds like a off night ... not typical.

{"text":"Stopped by Sprouts and discovered this gem!!Excellent wine selection. The wine selection is remarkable and adventurous. Great happy hour and delicious food. The wait staff was quite engaging. We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Great wine bar. Even better scallops. The best I have had. Very friendly staff. Highly recommend for a casual evening out."}
{"text":"I ordered the vegetable gnocchi  dish.  I was mushy.  I sent it back. I should have ordered salad. Maybe and I mean maybe I will return some they took it off the bill."}
{"text":"REVIEW FOR SUNDAY BRUNCH ONLY
I'm a fan of this place for lunch and dinner in which it is 4*.  I've steered many friends to this establishment for both.  When my wife and I discovered they were also open for Sunday brunch we wanted to check it out.  We found it below our expectations for what they provide for lunch and dinner.  the eggs were cooked on too hot of a grill scorching the eggs and mine were more than the O/M I ordered.  Coffee was barely warm and the server didn't seem to want to brew another pot.  If you want a good breakfast in that area go to Egg N'Joe in the same shopping center."}
{"text":"What a pleasant nearby surprise!  This place needs to advertise more!  Totally a hidden gem.  We were expecting your typical cheese and fruit food that wine bars serve and were totally pleased to see the variety of appetizers, entrees (including specials) and unique desserts!  I will do my best to talk this place up but my advice to the owners is to do some creative advertising somehow.  People do look at the coupons (maybe free appetizer?) that are sent in the mail!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the staff is very attentive! Wine selection is wonderful and they always have featured wines. Your taste buds will most definitely have a great time with the variety of food and drinks available!! Cheers!!"}
{"text":"I have been there 4 times now and have yet to experience anything short of superior service, food and wine. The atmosphere is friendly and well attended to."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant!  Excellent food, wonderful wine list (including fine wines by the glass), upscale but not pretentious and great service.  We will be regulars!"}
{"text":"This seems to be a well-kept secret in Scottsdale. We've been to Grape too many times to count, can usually get in w/o a wait, and we've never had a bad meal. Nice variety on the menu.  I often get the burger but I've tried other things and like them.  Nice selection of wines and both wine and food fairly priced.  Yesterday evening Chris was our server and I don't think he'd waited on us before.  He and all wait staff are great.  Friendly, attentive, but don't hover. Tables are far enough apart you can have a conversation w/o sharing it with the neighboring table.  And the sound levels when we've been there have been good.  Try it and see if you don't love it."}
{"text":"my wife and I had a wonderful lunch thanks to Robert the food was wonderful the servicewas 5 star and hes a great personality what a gem thank u"}
{"text":"Love this place! Was super excited when this opened because it's very close to work. My biggest suggestion is adding \"bistro\" to the name!! When I was telling my co-workers how great the place is they all thought it was a place that just sells wine and cheese. 

I've been twice now. The decor couldn't be cuter! Love everything about it! The food is amazing! The prosciutto Brie sandwich is a must!! The Caprese Prosciutto sand which is also amazing. Both are served on an awesome ciabatta bun with delicious fries!  

The also have wine on tap! How cool is that!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints...it's close to my work so when I want a good meal I always end up here. The staff is very friendly and very accommodating. They let me order my favorite meal at lunch even though it's not on their lunch menu-it's only on their dinner menu. Chicken Malinese...it's served with mashed pototoes and a small salad-it's perfection and always puts a smile on my face. They have a very nice selection of wines and a very good hh also. If you want to try a new place -I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"First time in and found it to be just OK.  Ordered 2 bacon blue burgers. One was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and the other was overcooked (ordered medium).  Wait staff offered to replace but did not want to wait another 20+ minutes for another burger.  Sweet potato fries are excellent!  Compared to other restaurants $16 is high for a specialty hamburger.  Service was the best-friendly and great about checking in throughout the meal."}
{"text":"The wine was absolutely delicious and the food was even better!  Wonderful evening spent with friends!"}
{"text":"Time and time again, we are never disappointed with this place.  In the mood for a cocktail or glass of wine and an amazing gourmet burger for about $25?  This is the place to go!  We started at the bar and enjoyed a well-made martini cocktail and had fun laughing and bantering with the bartender, she was so upbeat and fun...3 out of 4 of us chose a gourmet burger and were stunned at how delicious they were...starting with angus beef and all the trimmings served on a pretzel bun (very flavorful as compared to boring hamburger buns).  We all chose a different version of the fries....truffle, sweet potato and regular fries and they were perfectly cooked and oh so flavorful.  We have tried many other options on their menu and as mentioned above, we're never disappointed, this is the place to go for comfort food...so fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"What a great little gem here in North Scottsdale. Vegetable gnocchi were great and the salmon potato galettes were a work of art."}
{"text":"Cute place and people are nice (would go back for a drink) but the food does not compare to the amazing places nearby!"}
{"text":"In my previous review I mentioned that I thought the host/waiter was the owner and he is not. I am giving this place another star because the actual owner took the time to reply to me on yelp, with a response that seems like they're truly interested in their customers feedback and cares about its business' reputation. I will definitely be back to help support this business."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time this past weekend to celebrate my husband's birthday with a handful of friends. Wow! They were so incredibly accommodating. Put a table together large enough to seat us all (abut 13); gave us happy hour prices on the apps even though we had missed happy hour by a few minutes.... then gave us 20% off all our bottled wine (we ordered many bottles over the course of 3 hours). Service was GREAT, food was really yummy, and wine list is really impressive (and we are kind of wine snobs, so that's saying a lot!) They brought a dessert for my husband on the house to help end the birthday celebration nicely -- really, everything was top notch. Our ONLY complaint, which is teeny-tiny, is that their garlic hummus is so garlicky, it just about knocked our socks off, LOL! But the other hummus (red pepper, I think) was lovely, and all the other apps were wonderful. Had the calamari, muscles, 2 types of bruschetta, cheese board, hummus duo... lots of stuff came through our table last night and really, everyone had a delightful time. I will absolutely dine here again. Oh, and kid friendly too, really. We had our 11 and 14 year olds with us, and it was FINE! They can hang with the grown-ups easily, and loved all the food too. Our big mistake at the end of the evening was forgetting to tip on the \"real\" bill total. Geez! What losers we are. I think we still tipped nicely, but usually, we are over-generous, and we had had too much wine to make good decisions, so while we were smart enough to Uber home, we were NOT smart enough to tip correctly. We will make up for that next time, we promise!! Judos to Grape, the manager, and the whole staff. You were great!! Will see you again soon."}
{"text":"We just stopped into this little bistro and we're very pleasantly surprised. The service was wonderful. Sonyia was very helpful and friendly. She introduced us to a new French rose, which is now one of our favorites! We ordered the special bruschetta of melted Brie with strawberries, basil & vanilla fig balsamic as well as the crab cakes. Both were phenomenal!  The crab cakes were 90% crab and not much filler. Monday's are all-day happy hour and they have 1/2 price bottle of wine on Tuesdays. 

We will definitely be back to try out some of the other menu items!"}
{"text":"I don't do a lot of reviews on here but just had to do one for this place. My wife and I randomly picked this place one night for dinner. I had one of the best burgers I've ever had here. Service was great as well. I can't wait to come back and try the chicken and waffles. I highly recommend Grape!"}
{"text":"My 2 daughters and I ate here on Sunday, April 23rd. That night one of my daughters got a bad case of food poisoning. She had ordered the braised lamb shank. I called the restaurant on Monday and asked for the Mgr. I spoke to the Asst. Mgr. Lynn. who said he would have the General Mgr. Robert call me the next day. I suggested they inspect the remaining lamb so nobody else would have the same horrible experience my daughter had.  It is now Thursday and I'm still waiting for that call. I would have at least expected an apology. I would not recommend this restaurant as the service was very slow also, and the restaurant was practically empty."}
{"text":"We had a mediocre first experience here but went back tonight as we had received a 20% off promo and decided to give it another shot. We started with the caprese which was fresh and delicious. My husband had the classically prepared BBQ ribs (he enjoyed) and I
had the lobster ravioli which was heavenly.  My husband wanted a little more direction on a wine to order and didn't feel he got it - also the atmosphere was mediocre. Overall I'd rather have amazing food/mediocre atmosphere than mediocre food/amazing atmosphere. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great experience. Staff was friendly . Great patio, we ate outside, little bit noisy close to the traffic crossroad. My wife and I ate schrimp scampi pasta. The rose wine by a glass was good  as well.

There is a large variety on the menu for every one. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"If you are ever looking for a place you didn't know you were looking for, Grape is the place. I cannot say enough amazing things here. From the wait staff to the food to the atmosphere of this place, everything was 5 star amazing. The bottles of wine we had were superb. The dinner was perfect. It came out fresh and piping hot. The taste was to die for. The staff was the best part. They gave suggestions on food to try and try it we did. The atmosphere was romantic but laid back. A perfect Sunday night date night. I would definitely try this place again and again and I know I would never be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow so I reviewed this place about 3 weeks ago and they had my review removed because well see for you  \"we found that it fell outside our Content Guidelines because it did not provide enough detail about your customer experience\"

 Well here is what I  said, it sure seems to me to detail my experience.

Removed Content:
This place is so close to being good but unfortunately we will have to settle for adequate. So if you are looking for a completely average place to go this is your place. Adequate service adequate food adequate decor this is your place. If you want instead something fun and unique I guess you will need to keep looking, but the good news is that you are in Scottsdale so places much better abound. 

Okay then I  guess I  will provide more details for you 

The service was extremely slow our server would disappear for very long periods of time. The tables are so smashed together it was easier to be part of the conversation with the people at the table next to me than it was with my wife. And the food as I said originally it was not bad it just wasn't good either. It was just kind of there. 

I somewhat expect this to be removed also but perhaps the management would be better off fixing the many problems or at least responding to my post than complaining to get bad reviews removed. No wonder they have so many high star ratings. I invite any of you to check out my other reviews almost all are very positive, this one is not, what should that tell you about my experience."}
{"text":"My second time for lunch. Again annoyed by glare off front window. Had fish and chips, fish slightly over cooked with burnt ends. Sweet potato fries excellent. 2 people had chicken sandwiches which were on the dry side. Would have preferred a better bread with some taste to it  rather than a big roll that was a bit too high to get into your mouth. 1 person had BBQ beef, too much sauce made the bun soggy so had to be eaten with knife and fork. Very good but needs better bread. Enjoyed the chocolate toffee pie. Service excellent but only 6 tables so not busy. I think it would be quite noisy with a full house as it is one big open room."}
{"text":"Go eat here!  We are very selective because we eat out a lot. Crab cakes were some of the best we have ever had. Our lunch was amazing and fresh. Cappuccino ice cream pie was light and amazing. Go here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Best crab cake, shrimp scampi and coconut cake..   And service was great!

And of course great wine!"}
{"text":"These guys know how to make a burger! Holy cow that was awesome! Bacon blue cheese burger on pretzel bun.  Fork drop..."}
{"text":"Grape is great! We have been there at least 4 times and have always enjoyed it. You can bring your dog on the patio which we like. Food is yummy and if you like mussels they have some of the best I've ever had. Reasonably priced and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just had another lovely double date night, our waiter Chris was on point. Thank you for a fun Friday night :)"}
{"text":"The service here was very unprofessional. The hostess was on her phone and biting her nails, the bus boys were sitting at the bar watching TV, and our waitress indirectly called me fat after I gave a large order. At one point there were no employees on the floor at all. The food was not enjoyable. We ordered tasteless, dry, chicken pasta; small, mushy crab cakes served on salad dressing (yuck!); a brie plate with rock solid bread; and a turkey burger with a side of \"the worst coleslaw ever\". The prices were too high for a restaurant with mismatched chairs and glasses. The atmosphere was a confusion of high class and informally tacky.

I would not recommend dinning here, instead I would warn people away considering the fact that my whole family left feeling sick."}
{"text":"We ordered two Chicken Parm sandwhiches and 1 coke for lunch it was $33.00. I work in the area do not live in the area so this would not be a place I would frequent but I might if the food was better. The chicken breading smelled and tasted of oil. Fries were totally soggy and they had just brought them out from kitchen as I waited. Pretty generous portion but most of it wound up in the trash. The girl who took order was quite nice. Soul Cafe much better"}
{"text":"The Food was great and the service was great too! The Lobster Ravioli is to die for! The Girl Scout's mint cookie milk shake was absolutely a must! Thank you, Lynn & Kellie, you really took care of us. We will be back again."}
{"text":"Was very impressed by this little place - what a great neighborhood gem.  The burrata salad was well presented and delicious.  Two of us had lobster ravioli which was outstanding.  There was actual lobster in the ravioli - who knew??!!  The other 2 in our party had spaghetti with meat sauce and both were equally satisfied with their choice.  My friend is gluten free and very happy to find out they could accommodate her request for gluten free pasta.  Lovely wine selection and our server was excellent.  We loved that the noise level was low and we could talk, but not sure how loud it might be in high season.  Give it a try.  I know we'll be back."}
{"text":"I am such a fan of this place and am confused as to why it's always empty whenever I go! The food is really really good, everything I've tried has been excellent, well made and fresh. 

I've driven by loads of times and prior to finding this place I thought it was a store that sold wine. Luckily for me I use Yelp and realized it was a wine bar. It is very chic inside, with plenty of tables and booth seating, and a fun bar area. They also have an outside patio which is dog friendly, so in the winter months you can bring your pup out for wine with you!

I normally order the salads, which are very fresh and creative. They sometimes have a special of a warm spinach salad with shrimp with this incredible bacon dressing. It is very special. The truffle burger and pasta dishes are also very good. Every time I've come, myself and everyone else that I've come with has enjoyed their food immensely. They recently updated their menu and I can't wait to try out some of the new dishes that they offer.

The wine is well priced and they have a good variety. The only thing they don't offer, which I think would be great if they added, would be flights of wine for sampling multiple. The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgable about the wine and the food. The price is also on point, I highly recommend that people check this place out either for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I had heard and read some wonderful things about this Bistro and Wine Bar tucked away in a strip mall along Scottsdale Road, near Pinnacle Peak:  

\"Absolute fantastic \"  \"Never disappointed\"  \"Its a hidden gem\"  \"Great menu\"  \"I love this place\"  \"Best crab cakes!\"  \"These guys know how to make a burger\"  They have a couple of dozen Five Star Reviews, which I am now adding my own. 

So with our entire family in town, we decided to come here for an evening out.  Guess what?  We weren't disappointed. 

We made reservations and we were greeted warmly when we came in. Grape has two sections, a very relaxing and laid back Bar area, the other being their spacious Dinning area.

We started off with some Warm Brie ($11.00) and a Small Cheese Plate ($14.00) for the table, while one of us tried their French Onion soup ($4.00). All were very good and tasty. 

For our entrées, we went with their BBQ Ribs ($19.00), Scallops ($29.00) and two of their Chicken Milanese which were $18 each. Wow, where to begin. I ordered the scallops which came on a bed of Italian Risotto. Incredible!  I also had a change to taste the chicken and it had a lot of complex tastes and flavors. Great!

For dessert, the four of us shared their Coconut Cake ($10.00) and Cappuccino Pie ($8.00). What a great way to end an evening. 

The each of us all thought we had experienced something special and each thought this was Five Stars. 

Expect to pay around $40 each, before taxes and gratuities - and depending on how much and how many delectable tastes you want to experience at Grape. Explore and have fun, as we did. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this secret gem.  Awesome people, quickly greeted us as we walked in and treated us as we we're the only people there, yet they were rather busy.  I appreciate a staff that make recommendations based on fact finding questions, this was the case and they nailed it.  Food and wine was spectacular.  Only downside, I was couldn't stop eating and I was so full.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Their house wine was very good. My mom is gluten free and she had a burger with a gluten free bun and it was the best gluten free bun she has ever had! I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch, place was empty. Only one other table. I had the meatloaf sandwich, dry and flavorless. Sweet potato fries were good though. Hubby had the chorizo burger that had huge sliced raw jalapeño on a pretzel bun. He said couldn't  taste the chorizo and bun was too sweet for what the burger was supposed to be.  Not sure we'd go back, wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"We had dinner last night,and to my surprise the place was packed.  My first time having supper there.  This is a hidden jewel in a sea of Italian Restaurants.  To top it off the prices are so reasonable for north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Grape hosted a charity event I put together to benefit Fiesta Bowl Charities.  They went above and beyond to support a great cause:  Send a vet,  kid,  teacher to the Cactus Bowl. Grape facilitated the event,  provided fabulous cheese and meat boards, along with salmon bruschetta, which was excellent! They also donated some items for my raffle!   Orangewood wines donated the Wine! can't say enough about how wonderful they are, and how much fun everyone had! Thank you so much Grape, and Lynn, you're the best! I highly recommend for great wine,  fantastic food, great staff and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Wow! So good.  My lovely wife and came to an early dinner on Tuesday.  I can't believe how good this place is. If my wife's hair dresser had not mentioned this place, we would never had come because of the name. We really thought is was a wine store and/or wine bar. So glad we came. 

We started with the crab cakes. 17 dollars, or 14 during happy hour. Amazing! Probably the best we have ever had. Nice portion. Real crab. Perfectly seasoned. The remolaud sauce was a perfect accompaniment. 

My wife ordered the diver scalops which she said were the best she had ever had. I thought the first one I tried was a tad over cooked. The other bite I had was perfect. This came with mushroom risotto which we had heard was devine and it was. 

I had the chicken and shrimp picatta special. Really delicious. Nice lemon flavor. It had nice big  shrimps, tender chicken, and artichoke hearts in a light lemony sauce. It normally comes with pasta of your choice but I asked if the mushroom risotto  could be substituted which they did. I loved both. 

The bread was good, not great. I would,have preferred a bit more crusty bread. Not sure if it was scratch made. 

We were stuffed so no desert but the offerings looked really good with creme Brulee, coconut cake and tiramisu to name a few of the offerings. 

Service was 5/5. Food was 5/5. Overall 5/5. We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Wow, we found out last week that grape was catering lunches around the valley so we had them cater our companies lunch and learn for 30 plus people in our office. Everything was so fresh and was delivered right on time and so professional. We had hummus, 2 different salads with grilled chicken and salmon options, the herb fried chicken salad sliders on grilled pretzel buns were my favorite. We will definitely use them again, I can't wait to eat at the restaurant so I can have a glass of wine."}
{"text":"Meh.  Probably deserves 2.5 stars.  Came as a party of 4 for happy hour to take this new-to-this-location place for a test drive...  Ordinary food (at best), though we ordered only to small plates.  Dazed and confused service.  First thing I noted was their $8/glass chardonnay ($5 HH price) was NOT 'The Arsonist' as listed on their website.  Second item noted upon seating was there was NO menu or written description of HH - we had to ask what was HH (basically $3 off glasses of wine and small plates).

We ordered a $14 ($11 at HH) cheese plate (came with some old, close to toss-out stage grapes - apparently it was too much trouble for the kitchen to run 50 yards across the lot to Sprouts for some fresh ones?), mussels (ungenerous portion overcooked with many broken shells - worst item we ordered), fried calamari (ok), smoked salmon (served on a cooked ahead of time potato pancake - a hot and fresh latke would have significantly improved this dish), and meatballs (5 small, very bread-crumby balls - meh).

Server was nice but basically clueless.  Place staffed mostly by kids. Overall a disappointing first visit.  We won't be back anytime soon...  

This seems like the perfect spot for your basic, local closet-alcoholic housewife to yell to the hubby as she heads out the door that she is headed to Sprouts (which is in same parking lot) for some lettuce and then instead quickly detour into this place late in the afternoon for a few belts of cheap $5/glass chardonnay before arriving loaded (literally and figuratively) back home with the groceries...."}
{"text":"This is a great place!  Nice wine list, and the menu is versatile with food that is well thought out. Food is really good - and we are \"foodies\". Fresh ingredients, perfect portions. This is our second time here, we will be back!  Outdoor patio is dog-friendly.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the ambience with great lighting, and PURPLE leather seats! The great friendly service made me feel so welcomed:) I liked the yummy caprese salad, and the meatballs! They have HAPPY HOUR on FOOD AND DRINKS EVERYDAY, I LOVED that awesome surprise when I walked in after working all Sunday."}
{"text":"A great addition to your lunchtime rotation if you work in North Scottsdale!  We enjoyed great food with wonderful service.  Portions and quality were excellent and prices were comparable to a more casual, quick service restaurant.

I ordered the BLT with tater-tots (when they say comfort food, they're not kidding).  The server showed me a picture of the ridiculous girl scout cookie shake they make...would be fun for a special occasion for kids.  Great reviews from the entire group.

Looking forward to visiting again soon...looks like an excellent happy hour spot."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and efficient. Room will seat several large groups. Bar is quaint and lends to meeting those around you. Great location in a good neighborhood.

Menu is basic but driven at dishes that will easily pair with many varietals. 8 draught handles (some local) and the others are just good selections. Clean and fresh. Pretty retro in nature... cool diggs. #vino2ultimate #vinosquared

{"text":"We went on Wednesday June 15 at 5.30 pm . We ordered two raspberry lemon drop martinis, they tasted really awful , like Robitussin on the rocks ! We called the server and she took them back , we then ordered two glasses of wine , one white and one red .A gentleman came over and said the bartender had forgotten to put lemon in the drinks , the main ingredient , he had been distracted !!! We also ordered food , meatballs , and caprese  and  smoked salmon . Food was ok but nothing exceptional . Then when we got the bill , over 50 dollars , the red wine was 13 dollars and the white wine was 15 dollars , a little pricey for happy hour  ! We will not be coming back , bad cocktails , ok food and overpriced , pity ."}
{"text":"Went to Grape Bistro with 2 friends and really enjoyed their happy hour. Our waitress was informative and gave us suggestions on our wine orders and food.
Prices were reasonable and plan to come back!"}
{"text":"Great little find! They have an excellent selection of wines by the glass or the bottle. Grapes also offer beers on tap and full bar with lots of yummy cocktails. 

Their menu offers a nice selection of appetizers and main dishes. My husband and I shared the meatloaf and it was outstanding!

The staff is extremely friendly and even remembered our name on our second visit.  Prices are good and they even offer a happy hour time!

Relaxed atmosphere.  All and all a great spot to stop in for diner, drinks or snacks."}
{"text":"We be had such an enjoyable dinner.  My husband ordered the meatloaf and loved it.  High compliment as he is a meatloaf snob!! I ordered 2 house customer favorites (according to our waitress), mussels and Mac and cheese.  Both are fabulous!! We will be coming back as there were other delights on the menu we wanted to try."}
{"text":"I like a good wine bistro but this place just isn't one.  The service is friendly enough although it's super slow.  Place is nice and roomy but I sat facing some strangely tilted mirror that distorted the view so much it was car sick worthy.

We ordered the hummus which was pretty good.  I liked that it came with pita and veggies.  

We also ordered the chicken sandwich and the fish n chips.   

The chicken sandwich was nice and juicy and came with a salad, or fries or fruit cup or ...  The server never asked which one we wanted and we ended up with the salad.  Kind of wanted the fries.

The fish and chips came with a small cup of malt vinegar on the plate - nice touch.  The vinegar had spilled onto the plate so if you're not a vinegar fan too bad.  I like vinegar so that was fine.  Fries were nicely cooked.  

So here is where it goes south.  Besides taking forever to come out, the fish was soggy.  It had the crispy deep fried look but that was an illusion.  The smaller pieces bordered on doughy."}
{"text":"My husband and I have come to this small restaurant a few times and enjoyed it. Service has always been great. We love the classic cheese burger here. Angus beef on a pretzel bun - soooo delicious!  They have a variety on their menu and it is a nice atmosphere (casual.)  We plan to go back again and again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Wednesday night for a quick dinner. Ordered the Dover sole and my husband ordered the salmon.  Our meal arrived quickly and was absolutely delicious. Our server was great. Would have taken a picture of our dinners but we inhaled them .  What a pleasant surprise for us to have a place to go and get quality meals in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"What a little gem this place is!  The atmosphere is classy yet welcoming.  And the food...yum!  Visited with a large group so we had a good selection of appetizers- the brie is not to be missed!  Everyone loved their dinners.  I chose the sole which came with the most amazing cauliflower mash I've ever had.  And let's not forget dessert- order the coconut cake.  

Can't wait to come back some day when I can sample the wine list :)"}
{"text":"Great place just up the street from our house! Came here on a Friday night for my husband's birthday. We started out with the crab cakes. They were very meaty with little to no extra filling. I had the short ribs which were tender and flavorful. My husband got the linguine bolognese and he enjoyed it. The portions were larger than expected. Overall we enjoyed the food and wine and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place has a great menu! Something for everyone. I love the ambience and the service is great. Will definitely keep coming in"}
{"text":"Went with friends for Happy Hour.  Service was pleasant and quick.  We ordered the small plates of smoked salmon and mussels.  We also got the Cobb salad.  $3off wine and small plates during Happy Hour.  The salmon was delicious with 2 potato galettes (a crispy potato pancake) layered between slices of salmon.  The mussels were cooked perfectly with a nice wine sauce and a baguette slice t soak up the broth.  The Cobb salad was ample and fresh.  The atmosphere is nice and it was a quiet evening where everyone could converse without shouting."}
{"text":"Decided to try it as a new restaurant (and had a coupon).  Went with 2 neighbors and we were sorely disappointed.  The service (Thursday night at 6pm) was horrible!  The waiter only stopped by once we started to complain and he expressed \"not my fault\", \"don't blame the messenger\", \"we had a large party come in right when you did\" but we saw other tables being served and they need to figure out how to manage everyone there.  My two friends thought their fish was good; my chicken was average.  My friends said they may try again with a visit to the bar and some appetizers; I'm not so sure I would with all the other options that are in the area.  Was disappointed - wanted to really like this place based on location."}
{"text":"Most unusual dining experience we have had. We ordered the mussels and 4 out of 10 did not open so we sent the 4 unopened ones back. The waitress brought us 4 \"new\" mussels, but 1 did not open. Unopened mussels should not be eaten because it means the mussel was not fresh. The waitress took the unopened 1 back, and brought a new 1 on a plate and slid it back into our bowl. Then, we noticed that the 4 \"new\" mussels looked like the same bad mussels we sent back, but just forcibly pryed open, because the mussel flesh looked traumatized and ripped from the stem holding it in place and because part of one shell appeared as if it were chipped by a knife.  We showed the mussels to the manager, and he agreed with our observation and matter of factly apologized and offered to take it off the bill.  We don't know if they pryed it open out of ignorance of the danger of eating mussels that did not open on their own or if they knowingly did it to cut corners. 

Service was not professional. Towards the end of dinner, the waitress said they forgot to offer us bread (which was supposed to be given at the beginning of the meal) and asked us if we still wanted it. 

As for the rest of our meal, the bruschetta special was so so. Crab cakes were tasty, but small and expensive. The filet salad was pretty good and had a generous portion of perfectly cooked filet, but there was too much arugula and not enough other veggies or cheese. 

We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"OPEN!
Started with saut'eed calamari, it was delicious. We were dipping the 
bread in the sauce. If you are tired of deep fried breaded fare order this dish.
The happy hour has crazy prices on wine. Our server was attentive and 
recommended his selection of wines and food. We followed his lead and
were surprised with  the quality of the dishes.  I was surprised at the check,
4 glasses of wine, calamari, 2 dinners under $40.00 (happy hour prices)!"}
{"text":"Love this place Bolognese terrific Greek salad is awesome fish and chips great lamb is terrific"}
{"text":"Our favorite place to come on Friday nights! We are from Philadelphia part of the year and have high expectations for cuisine when at our Scottsdale home. Grape's food is fabulous. From the baked Brie, mussels, savory salmon on a crisp potato pancake, to the fabulous wine selection... we love everything. The wines are fresh and delightful. A special shout out to Chris (Dan) our waiter.... 

Back for about our 12th time on 11/11/17. Had eggs Benedict... flawless and perfect. Shout out to Lynn (even if he is a Utes fan) and to Kayla. Fabulous and friendly service."}
{"text":"Excellent food and wait staff! My husband and I had the specials- crab ravioli and short rib ravioli. So good! If you're looking for a cute date night spot I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"We used to go to their old location but loving the new digs. Busy on a Wednesday night and so happy to see it doing so well. Staff is friendly and service oriented. The food is fantastic. Tonight we stared with the cheese board and that was followed by Pasta Bolognese and Veggie Gnocchi.  This place is a wonderful addition to the the area. Say hello to JASON the manager and Lynn the bartender."}
{"text":"The burgers were heavy. Loved the pretzel bun and I'm skipping the bacon next time. These burgers got in my head. Robert was very personable and professional. I recommend Grape to anyone. 
Service food outstanding"}
{"text":"Marissa the bartender is absolutely outstanding. She has a vast knowledge of her wine list , her regions, grapes and vineyards. She is also a mixologist with a sense of adventure. Sampled several liqueurs I had never heard of. 
I went for happy hour and met great people, drank great wine paired with small plates. Very fun , friendly and delicious!"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this place last night. The food was very good ... I had the Blu burger, with  great sweet potato fries! The menu is salads burgers and some eclectic entrees and what looked like fabulous desserts. We didn't have any dessert on this visit ... but next time! They have a very extensive wine list as well. The reason for the 4 stars is due to the service. Very chaotic and slow. It could just be that it was understaffed for a Saturday night. All in all ... I will be returning to try some other menu items and a desserts!"}
{"text":"We had an office luncheon catered by Grape Bistro last week... What an amazing spread! Definitely not standard office lunch fare... Perfect Salmon, 2 choices of unique salads, delicious hummus and pita bread, grilled chicken, chicken salad with pretzel rolls, I could go and on...Every single thing was delicious and our entire company was raving about them! It really showed the variety of foods Grape Bistro can prepare. Not every restaurant has a menu where everything is amazing... they may have one or two signature dishes. Grape Bistro showed they have a expansive menu and they take great pride in turning out an excellent meal."}
{"text":"Love this place! The salmon is fantastic! Consistently great service, food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my [25th anniversary of my 21st birthday] at Grape last night, and had an incredible experience!  Stellar service--from host to server to support and staff--delicious food, and a hugely impressive wine list.  The charming and generous server made the night for 14 people a tremendous success and I could not have asked for better wine, more attentive service, or a more joyful birthday.  Thank you to everyone at Grape for making getting old such a pleasure!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped at Sprouts and were starving afterwards. We usually go to Blu Burger for burgers, but since they've stopped allowing dogs on the patio, we're not really inclined to give them our business. So when we came across \"Grape,\" we thought at first it was a wine shop. We stopped in anyway out of curiousity, and I'm so glad we did. 

Turns out it's a bistro that offers not only an excellent wine list, but great food as well. It was fairly early, so there were few of us in there. Our server was right on top of things and we were able to sit where ever we pleased, so chose a nice comfy booth. Decor was modern and clean and very attractive. 

The wine list, as stated, was extensive, and I chose a Daou Cabernet, which I've been wanting to try for a while. It was perfect. My husband had the moderate priced Chardonnay, and even that was quite good. Since it was happy hour, we were able to indulge in several glasses without breaking the bank. 

Since we had both been thinking \"burger,\" we chose the Classic burger and the Blue Cheeseburger, with truffle fries. Neither disappointed. In fact, the Blue Cheeseburger, in my opinion, was better than any I've had in any upscale burger joint. Moist and juicy, flavorful and just wonderful. My husband enjoyed the classic burger and truffle fries. 

Best of all, the patio is very dog friendly, so we'll be bringing Dexter and Molly with us next time."}
{"text":"Nice service, good food. The sweet potato fries are incredible. I had two half salads that were quite tasty. Our friends loved the meatloaf. Good place for lunch. We will definitely be back to try some more of the limited but worthwhile menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic....without exxagerating Grape Bistro is a gem to have to close to the house. The dinner menu is quite varied and there is something to suit every taste bud.

I chose the blue cheese burger as I wanted something simple and it was scrumptious. My dinner guest had the same and we also started our evening with a cheese plate to share which was lovely.

Our waitress Kayla was very warm and attentive.

So glad I finally got to try Grape Bistro and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner. The apple Stilton salad was one of my favorite salads ever. Simply delicious. The hamburger was cooked perfectly and was just great. Fabulous price on wine by the bottle. Took home what we didn't finish. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We received a coupon in the mail so we decided to try it since we live nearby.  It's a hidden gem located in a strip mall that we never would have noticed if it wasn't for the flyer.

We orders a bottle of wine and our food was great. We started with the salmon appetizer and it was delicious. For our entrees we had the shrimp scampi, the short rib, the bolognese and a burger.

We plan on coming back for happy hour when the prices are reasonable. My only suggestion would be to lower the wine prices on the menu during regular dining hours. The wine prices are WAY too marked up. We dine out a lot and compared the prices, the wine is priced like Mastro's and it's just not the same kind of dining experience. If they lowered the prices, they would probably get a regular following during dinner hours. 

We are happy to have found a cute restaurant nearby with friendly service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Alert to Maryland Crab Cake lovers; try this place! The crab cakes are really good. They are about half the size of what we are use to, but very filling. I have been searching all over the valley for good Maryland style crab cakes; this is the closest I have found. This is the second visit to this restaurant. I enjoyed fabulous meals both times. Service was good. The location is very accessible with plenty of parking and spacious seating indoors and out with dog availability on the patio. This is located in the same strip mall as Sprouts."}
{"text":"New experience.  Apparently this is a relo.  Came in tonight (Tuesday) and it was packed with a more senior crowd (no issue with that).  

Ordered 3 small plates and it took about an hour.  (Bruschetta, burrata, and calamari...nothing complex). Wine glass went bone dry 2 times.  We were barely checked on and never even asked if we wanted an entree.  At this point I was only minimally frustrated (even with the average dishes). However, I was astonished when I politely asked the \"waitress\" for the check and I stated \"I just want to get out of here\".  She actually answered \"me too\"!  Shocked by her answer, I then complimented that we were frustrated, but appreciated the fact that she was 1 of 2 servers and she was \"busting her ass\".  While i was stunned that she was quick to dump on the restaurant (supposedly understaffed 4 nights in a row) and not have any empathy for our poor experience, I was more shocked when she told me that she was the \"manager\". It all came together at that point.  

For the ownership, I am sure she is not only not reflective of the wait staff you are seeking, but I highly doubt she is the management you want representing your restaurant. If the management doesn't care about your restaurant, we surely won't be making a return."}
{"text":"I went twice in one week. Does that tell you enough!? 
There lunch/happy hour menu is amazing. Just get one of everything! You will not be disappointed. 
They also have plenty of selection when it comes to happy hour wines. 
Can't wait to go back for dinner one day."}
{"text":"Very friendly service and tasty food  Marissa was our waitress and was very sweet! Great atmosphere and good wine selection!"}
{"text":"This place was great!  The wine selection is big and the food was good.  The waitress that we had Rikki was awesome.  She was honest about her experience with wine, but was able to get all questions answered for our party with a sweet smile on her face.  Her warm personality and attention to service was spectacular.  Can't wait to go back.  Grape Bistro, you are lucky to have such a great server."}
