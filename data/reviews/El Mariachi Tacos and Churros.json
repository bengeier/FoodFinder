{"text":"We went in the initial weeks of when the restaurant opened. Food is excellent, one of the places where I enjoyed fish tacos, a bit over priced though !!
When a restaurant charges 3$ for few slices of jalape√±os (yes it sounds crazy) I would not rank them high. 
Besides that good food and good service."}
{"text":"Was in the area and stopped in a quick lunch. 

I really enjoyed the food. Lots of flavour, good selection. If I am ever back out this way I'll make sure to come back."}
{"text":"Went to El Mariachi for lunch on Saturday.  Service was enthusiastic and friendly.  We got the guac and chips for an appetizer, and the Baja tacos and the Tacos al pastor.  Everything, including the guac and chips is made in-house, and was delicious.  If I have a complaint it's that the beer list needs major attention. It would have been nice to see a good variety of Ontario beer styles on tap instead of bland Anheuser-Busch stuff like Rolling Rock and the like that all taste like one another."}
{"text":"Always ready and set to come down to El Mariachi!!! They're updated menu is amazing, everything on it is good! Servers are all super friendly! Shoutout to Shannon for always being a joy with her service! Highly recommend you try the new chimichanga!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Nice decor and fun live entertainment. A very busy Friday night and seemed they couldn't handle it. Service was friendly but slow... food came in batches, adults got their meal 15 min before the kids. Asked for extra tortillas, never came. Food was cold on the plate and tasted just ok and certainly not worth the price. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing ..amazing staff and a great time. Koodo's to James he's an amazing bartender very personable"}
{"text":"We went during the Christmas festival & the waiting staff did forewarn us that the wait on the food would be extremely long so we didn't mind the wait. 

The food was great and fresh when we finally got it, the patio at the back had a pretty cute ambiance for date nights, but I would check weather conditions to stay clear of windy/rainy nights before committing to it.

Over all enjoyed my experience, minus my beer order being wrong.. 

I'd come back during a quieter night. The place shows promise & with the food, I can imagine that I could soon revise this to a 5 star!"}
{"text":"Can't believe the negative reviews here. A lot seem to be from really young people who might not get that the prices are actually very reasonable for the quality and size. $13 for 3 fish tacos is a fantastic deal, especially for the quality of the fish. Frig, a McDonald's meal is $10 these days, what are you expecting? The service is friendly and the patio is large and secluded. Every person I know who has been here raves about it."}
{"text":"I went here to meet a friend for drinks and tacos on a Friday night and from the minute we are greeted at the door we felt like we were being welcomed as guests into a fun comfortable atmosphere. The manager served us and made sure we were happy at all times making good recommendations and making sure we were having the best experience possible which we did! I ordered the Baja fish tacos and my friend ordered the steak quesadilla. The tacos were the most amazing fish tacos I've had anywhere and was a huge portion of three tacos and could easily have been shared the quesadilla was a smaller portion and I would recommend ordering a side to go along with it but my friend said they were delicious. The atmosphere is colourful and authentic to go along with the homemade food and made us feel like we are on vacation which is exactly what we were looking for on a Friday night after a long week thanks El Mariachi we will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"lol this place sucks. 

Ordered the molten cheese with mushrooms, baja fish tacos and the pork tacos 

it was 37.50 .... 

Tacos were so basic and served at rooms temperature. Meat wasn't hot at all 

I would never go back. Super disappointing"}
{"text":"They do try hard, and I would argue they are one of the better Mexican restaurants in Mississauga -- the said, the flavor is mild, perhaps catering to the local demographic. The quality was good, and the service was incredible. My experience with the food could have been a one-off situation. Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good Mexican food in the west, that's why when I came across El Mariachi - I was super excited. We went on a Saturday night around 9:30 PM. The bar had a few people, the dining area had 2 young ladies out for dinner. 

The atmosphere was beautiful - traditional elements mixed in with current/modern vibes. Our waitress was very nice and sweet but really slow (this could also be due to the kitchen being slow). She originally took about 15 minutes to take our drink orders, then another 15-20 on top of that to take our appetizer order and about 30 minutes to deliver the nachos. She then asked if we were going to have dinner too.. I wish she just asked that when we ordered the nachos the first time but she ran off. 

I just don't understand how service can take so long when theres only 2 other people there..? and these 2 people left shortly after we came so they were only making food for us.

The food itself was good, not 'excellent' but good. I wish the nachos had more cheese and the corn tortilla's weren't cold but overall not bad. 

I would go back here again to give it another shot, I just hope that the service improves. Really nice people overall but perhaps hiring more/further training would be beneficial."}
{"text":"I went here twice in the summertime. The first time I went, it was a perfect 10 experience. It was a busy time so their patio was full hence we ended up sitting inside. The hosts were incredibly nice, the environment was nice and the food was delicious. I got street corn, fish tacos and chicken burritos, all of which I gobbled up within minutes because they were so good. 

The second time we went we were able to secure a place on their little patio. And it was instantly my favourite patio and in Mississauga. It felt like I was in an actual local restaurant in the Caribbean. They had some sort of special event so they were going around with free merchandise as well as free tequila shots so me and my partner were very excited. 

I had ordered chicken tacos and my boyfriend ordered beef tacos. While the beef tacos were alright, the chicken ones tasted stale and gross! My boyfriend managed to eat the beef tacos but I was only able to finish one and a half and I rarely ever waste food. We were both shocked because the first time we had gone there, their food was exquisite. We had eaten more or less most of our food so it didn't seem like we could complain. Plus, they had just given us some free shots and merchandise so it felt entirely inappropriate to complain about anything. 

Having said that though, I don't think this place is bad. Maybe something just went wrong with our order, and that happens sometimes. I am more than willing to go back again and try more things and will report back again!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite go to Mexican joints. The food is authentic and the service is awesome. The atmosphere and Latin music takes me back to my younger days travelling abroad. Located in beautiful Streetsville, this is the spot to go for great food, entertainment and ambiance."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment. Sat ten minutes in on a slow day around 5 before we were served. We ordered a steak quesadilla and their chicken tinga taco. Food took almost 45 minutes to come out and ended up tasting as if it was microwaved. The quesadilla was palm sized, had three flavourless pieces of steak and what looked to be a melted kraft single on top which cost around 10$. The chicken tinga tacos were so tiny, and the chicken tasted drier than the Sahara desert. $13. Disgusting. Tortillas we're so soggy. We all felt gross after. If you're looking for Mexican food in the village, walk an extra 2 minutes up the street to Cantina Mexicana. Such a nice location for a restaurant wasted on this joint. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"One of the absolute best Mexican restaurants in the city. I've been to El sombrero, Norder MX, Wilbur Mexicana, la carnitas, and a vast number of others and El mariachi beats it by far. We ordered the molten cheese, a mixed set of empanadas, and the Baja fish tacos. The food was exceptional, fresh, delicious, and quick to our table. Every dish comes with their signature hot sauces, which are great. The ambience is nice, some Spanish pop plays at a reasonable volume (that isn't complete garbage). The staff is nice and friendly. The owner even comes to check on you when you're done, which is nice of her. Churros are also to die for! Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were strolling along Streetsville hungry af and it was his idea to come here. I usually try to read reviews before I go into new uncommon restaurants but I was too hangry (hungry, angry). 

We sat on the patio and started with two coronas. The service was okay, the server recommended us a couple of the 'most popular dishes' and that's what we ended up getting. He was yet to tell us the shrimp dish was raw. 

The only thing that I actually ate was the taco. Maybe Mexican food isn't my groove but I would probably never come here again. It was definitely different for me. 

We paid our bill and I ended up at kookoo chicken lol."}
{"text":"Excelente place, food was good and service superb was about we had some flavour in sauga"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for the past few months and I have never been disappointed. I am always impressed with the people being so personable and making me feel welcome. Not to mention that the food is amazing. I went on valentines night and despite it being SO busy I was not treated any different than a normal night. Will always highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food! Such lovely decor and the mariachi band added to the whole experience. Ask for Avery. She was lovely."}
{"text":"Good food and good experience. Funny that I find better Mexican in Canada than I do in Mass, and for far less money. I had the enchiladas and she had the fish tacos. Started with the corn and ended with the churros. All good and very friendly."}
{"text":"I could round this up to 3 stars, as there's room for improvement. We visited on opening weekend (Saturday evening), and we understood right away that there would be issues (i.e. that food ran out, and we would have to wait an hour until they replenished supply). We understand that growing pains are part of any opening process, so we stuck around and drank some Jarritos until they finally had food available (about an hour after we were seated, they finally started taking food orders again). We expected the wait, and just sat around and relaxed until they were ready. For us, service was apologetic, sweet, and accommodating - thanks to Nikita for checking up on us often and for great service despite how busy they were!

Environment: This joint is casual and lively. You could take a date here, have a group dinner, and it could even be a place to take your family for dinner, if you so choose. Note that all their offerings are based off homemade recipes - so while the meal had some issues, I will say that their ingredients were very fresh and definitely tasted homemade. 

What We Ordered: Carnitas Tacos ($12.75), Chicken Tinga Tacos ($12.75), Guacamole ($10.50), and Churros ($8.50). Our initial reaction (along with many guests around us) was an expression about portion size (the table next to us kept joking around with a \"So... where are we eating after?\"). See my attached photos (with a cell phone beside each Taco order, to really understand the portion size situation). For the price we paid, I expected portions to be bigger. As for the churros - they were tasty, but a bit denser in texture than I expected.

Overall: The standouts for us were the Carnitas Tacos and Guacamole (the guac was similar in flavour to Wilbur Mexicana's - not on the same level, but almost there). Overall, flavours were acceptable, and the meal overall tasted way better than it looked - but (and this may be an opening weekend issue) value and portion size was lacking.

In total, for what we had, our total bill came to over $50.00 - with tip, over $60. For the portion size and meal we had, I felt we definitely overpaid - the meal's cost was on par to a King West bill, but instead, right smack in the middle of suburbia. We wouldn't mind giving this place a chance again once they settle in, so, out of convenience and proximity to home, we will probably be back."}
{"text":"For starters we ordered the guac and chips - guac was fresh and generously portioned; chips are warm and crispy

Mains:

Carne asada (steak tacos) had a very generous portion of meat and super filling - but not as flavorful as the fish tacos 

Baja fish tacos were delicious! Super flaky and again very sizeable - Im use to having two layers of tortilla for tacos that are messy but I'm not complaining cause I could barely finish my plate 

Overall good bang for you buck and a very authentic atmosphere

Would definitely visit again !"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst experience I had at any restaurant! I went on opening day with a friend only to be told that the kitchen staff was \"taking a break\" and they'd be \"about 30 minutes\". Well once those \"30 minutes\" passed we were told it would be another 40 minutes until we maybe got food; this is when the server told us they actually ran out of food. During this time the owners were too busy showing off the restaurant to their friends and family rather than apologizing to their actually paying customers about the delay. I got too sick of playing the waiting game and decided to leave. Needless to say I will never go here again due to this experience, and based on service alone, I wouldn't recommend anyone go there either. 

It is also worth noting that the people who stayed said their portions are ridiculously small and the quality of the food is laughable."}
{"text":"a new taco-focused joint is a /very/ welcome sight in streetsville.  bright orange-yellow exterior that you can't miss, and an inviting yellow-and-wood interior giving off a lively feel.  our waiter was outgoing and welcoming.

- fish taco: generous fried fish portions topped with cabbage and a chipotle mayo.  good balance of textures, and the mayo really augmented this one
- chorizo taco: ground pork loaded with unique chorizo spices, and topped with the classic onion and cilantro.  the meat was a bit dry, but i liked how explosive the flavour was
- rajas con queso taco: poblano peppers with onions, corn, sour cream, and melted cheese.  wasn't a fan of the slightly mushy pepper texture, but a decent taco overall

though the tacos were solid, and the $12.75 price tag for 3 tacos is great (considering that most places in toronto are around $5/taco), nothing really blew me away.  however, i'd probably come back to try more tacos, as well as their desserts.  churros, man...

tip: our waiter said you can mix 3 different tacos instead of getting 3 of the same, with the exception of the fish taco"}
{"text":"Do not read the low reviews on here....this is a great place!!!

This resturant is amazing! We arrived not knowing what to expect and it was an amazing experience. 

We sat on the patio. We had a lovely server and to top it off there was a live mariachi band. It was like we had escaped Mississauga and arrived in Mexico. The guacamole was so fresh and the corn chips were addicting! I had the steak quesadilla and it was so good. My husband had the steak tacos and key limr pie. Needless to say we stayed for 2.5 hours and loved it. I would come back anytime and enjoyed it.
I cannot even understand why people would rate this under a 5. This is real mexican food ....not American Mexican. This is the real deal and it is worth it!!! We will be back many times this summer...like a Mexican holiday for much cheaper. I do reccomend that they book the Mariachi band more frequently as it was so much fun!"}
{"text":"I came with my cousins, for the first time, while this was their second time. 

We ordered the nachos as starters, they were decent. I'd recommend, although nothing was distinct about them (no spice, nor flavour) 

We ordered the fish, chicken and beef nachos between the three of us and shared one of each. The fish nachos were beautifully fresh, loaded and bigger than the other two tacos. 

However the chicken tacos was stale and not hot nor was the beef tacos. We didn't realize because we were so caught up with our conversations, after realizing we were almost done, we started to talk about the food and all three of us agreed the chicken and beef nachos were not great compared to the fish tacos.

Our waitress brought our food late, and didn't check on us while we were dining, and had to wait to ask for water to be refilled and near the end when she asked if everything was ok? We told her our thoughts on the food and she was polite enough to take back the food to bring a new order but we were almost done and didn't have time to wait. 

This was my cousin's second time here, he was disappointed since he had a better first time around here. I'm not sure If i'll be back unless i'm in the area."}
{"text":"I was super excited when this place opened. But man, they need to make some adjustments. The food is just okay which makes the $13 for 3 tacos harder to swallow. I get what they're trying to accomplish but they fall short. 

We ordered the Baja tacos and they lacked any depth of flavour. All I tasted was batter.

Husband ordered El Pastor and the crispy pork lacked the crispy, resulting in a texture I would expect from Mucho Burrito. 

The highlight was the service was polite and friendly but vanished when we requested the cheque that took 30 min to show up.

Maybe if you treat this place as the snacks and drinks it would be appealing but as a resto, hit up something else for now. 

Bottom line: better than Taco Bell..."}
{"text":"Apps
Mexican street corn: This dish didn't seem fresh. The corn looked dark like it had been old and tasted the same way.

Entree
 Al Pastor: pork had good flavor, however there was chunks of burnt pork that was burnt past the point of being edible. Rice was stale. Beans and guacamole were average.

Bottom line: food wasn't fresh, won't go back"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place as I am a big fan of Mexican food. The building, the decor...all very cute. Unfortunately, the compliments stop there. We asked to sit on the patio. For some reason, the patio wasn't opened, which puzzled me, considering it was 30 degrees outside. Took a seat at the bar, ordered margaritas, and ordered some veggie tacos and the quesadillas with a description of \"crisp roasted pork\". The presentation of the veggie tacos was unappetizing. It looked like green mush on tortillas! We thought maybe it just didn't look nice so took a bite, only to discover it tasted as bad as it looked. The quesadillas were nothing special. The description was misleading and inside was not crisp roasted pork, but soft cooked pork. I don't know if we went on an off day, but my experience did not make me want to come back. I will be sticking to Border MX."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  Have been here several times and have not been disappointed.  Authentic Mexican food, with a few Tex-Mex items thrown in.  The price points are spot on and the portions are generous.  The food is flavorful, the service is friendly.  The only thing I wish they would do is make home-made tortillas.  Otherwise a must visit Mexican Food place for any and all in the GTA."}
{"text":"We went here maybe a few weeks after they opened. There was only one other couple there when we went, which is surprising for a Friday night.

We got the loaded nachos and the poblano tacos (which I wouldn't normally get, but they were the only vegetarian option). The nachos were alright, but they were more chips than anything else. Maybe about 60% of the chips were bare. We didn't like the tacos at all. It was just the poblano peppers, which weren't cooked properly, and a few other minor toppings. The sauce tasted good though.

I would probably wait a year or two and try this place again to see if they've improved, but it's definitely not on my list of go-to Mexican restaurants in Mississauga."}
{"text":"If we could give this place a negative comment we would! The one star is for the extremely polite waitress, a young girl from India. The food is a joke. Everything on the menu is a beyond mediocre. Quality, taste, portion, authenticity all zero. Will never go back there. Super disappointed."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Came here for a birthday lunch and sat in the patio. The ambiance was so nice and it was decorated perfectly.

The food was so good! I had the Baja fish tacos and the empanadas and it was all so amazing! Enjoyed everything about this restaurant! Deff can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Geez, this isn't Mexican nor tex-mex folks.  I moved here from Dallas so I think I know what tex-mex is all about.  This food sucks at any price but at the price these guys are charging, let me spell out the alternative:  Starts with a C, ends with an 'hipotle'.  At least that one doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is.

You want specifics?
- Guac was watery and too lemony
- Chips were good (but heck, it's hard to mess up fried corn donchathink?)
- Chicken Fajitas were so bad that I refuse to believe that THIS is what these guys are pedaling.  No wonder people are saying that Mexican food ain't for them.  I couldn't eat more than 2 bites as something in the meat itself felt off, as in rancid.  The seasonings were way off as well.
- Churros were good
- Burritos were edible..which is probably a huge compliment given the state of the chicken fajitas
- Jalepeno poppers were tasteless

Let's hope we get some real Mexican in these parts 'cuz this ain't it."}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp. It's true what they say. This is so far the best Mexican restaurant. Our server Nicole said this is as family own restaurant and the menu is from the original family recipe from Mexico. It's my second time coming to this restaurant. Never failed me with their Service :)... The loaded nachos is always good as an appetizer."}
{"text":"The churros here are awesome. Well worth it!

The tacos are decent. There are better options downtown Toronto. But if you can't get out to the city this is a decent option. 

The Baja tacos are crispy and smothered in sauce so can get messy. But I loved them. The steak tacos are ok. It is literally just meat on a tortilla. No veggies or other toppings.

The atmosphere is nice. When we went there was a live mariachi band which was a really nice treat. Servers were friendly and service was pretty fast. 

Personally I prefer to have my tacos tapas style where I can buy a few different kinds and just pay per taco. Here your options are limited to picking one kind of protein. So you get 3 of the same taco in one order. But for the price it is still pretty decent. 

Overall this is a great authentic Mexican option for the Mississauga area. I will go back to try the other options. Also there is a patio so might be a nice option in the summer."}
{"text":"I'll be honest - I only grabbed a drink here as well as an app to split with my friend. I really think this place is cute - the decor is warm and true to the vibe of the place and it's well kept - however, this doesn't negate for the fact that the service here is pretty slow and the food is a little pricey for what you receive. I didn't get to take any pictures, but the chips for the guacamole they give you are super crumbly and almost impossible to dip in the guac without it totally falling apart. While the guacamole was good, we were left with so much of it with no way to eat it because there were no chips left except for a bunch of broken flakes which had fallen off. I really do want to like this place, since I think it has the potential of being a really great spot to grab drinks and apps in Streetsville, but they definitely have to fix some of these kinks first."}
{"text":"Food here is excellent.  Everyone at our table ordered tacos of different varieties and each of us were very happy with the overall flavour and presentation.  What we weren't happy about was our server.  He forgot so many things that evening and did several things that were not acceptable in our eyes; one of the ladies asked for lime to go with her tequila shot and the waiter brought it over in his hands!!  No plate, no napkin.   He also forgot a drink, a request for an extra plate.  We ordered a Churros for dessert and one of our friends asked for hers in a to-go container.  He brought all of the orders in to-go containers and said that the kitchen made a mistake and if it was ok for us to each out of the containers at our seats????!!!  Dipping sauces were also forgotten.  
Our side dishes also came AFTER our meal was finished.   
So food is great here, service leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"So Graydon's has become a taco place! The. Menu features all the classic Mexican dishes but the quesadillas come in more than just the standard chicken and cheese option. 

I got roasted pork tacos with chilli, pineapple and cilantro. Meat was a bit dry and not nearly as flavourful. 

The staff are quite nice and helpful though and the patio they have in the back is well laid out and brightly decorated. The interior of the restaurant is a little dark and unflattering in my opinion. 

I could come back here but I have had better tacos. Not a bad place for a bite if you are visiting Streetsville."}
{"text":"I have been craving Mexican food after my recent trip to San Diego so I decided to check out some reviews on Yelp and ended up here. We seated ourself and waited over 15 minutes for the sever to come to our table. Granted, it was busy and he seemed to be the only server in the dining area. He kept passing by our table and I finally flagged him down. I ordered the enchiladas and it came out in a lasagna dish. The tortilla was soft and mushy and there was no seasoning on the food. 
If your choice is between this place and Taco Bell, choose Taco Bell. Highly disappointing experience."}
