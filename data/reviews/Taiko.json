{"text":"Yummy food! Great all day happy hour and the service was great."}
{"text":"Very quality Japanese food restaurant.  I generally get sushi but the occasions where I've gotten a don or lunch combo haven't disappointed.  They have rolls and daily specials that change all the time so it's worth coming back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, and still love it. Great reasonably priced and fresh sushi, awesome sake menu for those who appreciate a good Japanese sake with your meal. It's also a plus to see the owners every time I go to the place and they are always so friendly and welcoming. Tempura ice cream is delish."}
{"text":"Had a hankering for Japanese food and turned to yelp for some advice.  Good call on this place, friends!  We enjoyed a terrific lunch that included a little of everything - sushi, edamame, miso soup, teriyaki chicken, and salad.  Service was friendly and prices were very competitive.  I found a 20% off coupon on their website after the fact, so I'm looking forward to going back and enjoying another meal!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!

I was introduced to Taiko by a friend. After hearing me say so many times how I had not found a good sushi place to eat like in CA, she said it was a must I go with her. My friend is a regular and they made no exception towards me the first time I went. I saw how the owners knew everyone name that came in :).Every time I have gone in since my initial visit  Toshi and Maggie great me by name, even if a couple of months have passed by. Every friend I have taken Taiko returns on their own. I feel like I'm family when I am there. The staff is so attentive and willing to answer any questions. Sushi is always FRESH (I have gone to restaurants where I've been given still frozen fish).  It is a must to have their Miso soup. Once you place your order it does not take more that 15 minutes before you are served. In my experience, they get to know and remember what you order and make recommendations according to that. Their Happy Hour is amazing and full of different selections to make and inexpensive. I always leave there feeling like I ate at a family/friends house."}
{"text":"Great little place. Nice service and pretty acceptable prices. The teriyaki was a bit bland but made up for it with its perfect preparation on the cook. Sushi was good, they over cooked one of the rolls but where nice enough to take it off the bill. What made my meal was the S&M roll. That was scary good. One of the best rolls from here to Maryland. I will be back for that roll. I also got Salmon sashimi and was delighted to find how fresh and melt in your mouth it was. I will not be back for the teriyaki but I will be back for a lunch date or two."}
{"text":"Possibly the best sushi I've had in the valley! With it conveniently located close to home I swear I've driven by 100's of times. 

- fresh fish
- good prices with daily / weekly specials
- nice atmosphere but nothing over the top
- more traditional type rolls

I'm hoping word doesn't get out and spoil my private sushi oasis."}
{"text":"Saw all the wonderful reviews, so I decided to drive 25+ miles south to Chandler to try this place.  It is located in a strip mall, mom&pop place, nothing fancy about this place in term of deco, ambience or service. 

To tell if a sushi place is good, it starts from the rice. Don't underestimate the skill you need for that ... it's not just your normal 'press the rice cooker button' type of rice.  Only the true master can skillfully determine the right amount of rice to water proportion, time to cook it with the perfect blend of vinegar and seasoning to make good sushi rice.  
The rice of this place is toward the soft side, bit too much water and overpowered by the amount of vinegar. 

The freshness of the fish are in question... we tried number of nigiri and rolls ... the escolar and scallop are pretty good... but the salmon was a disappointment. You can just tell by the color ..
But the good thing is that you pay for what you get .... in a decent price range...
If you are close by, not a bad place to stop but prob not worth the 50 miles round trip"}
{"text":"The calamari is bad. Over cooked and flavorless.  The sauce didn't help it. The sushi wasn't bad but didn't separate itself from the other places nearby and it was pricey. The worst part was the service. I might have given the place another try but they brought me the wrong sushi. It looked similar to what I ordered so I started to eat it. They then brought me what I ordered. I thought no big deal no way they will charge me for it. No, they told me because I started to eat it I should pay half price at least for it. The owner argued with me about it until I gave up. I just took the money out of the tip. Way to make a first impression. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Another nice happy hour. My husband and I enjoy the family owned aspect and the fresh food. Tried the KOIKA KARAAGE (Calamari) and it was great. The Gyoza was yummy too. Our favorite roll is the Spicy Yellowtail but the others we've had are good too. Love that they now have a Happy Hour menu everyday, any time."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and fabulous Japanese cuisine.

We are so very happy that we found Taiko. We were in need of a new local sushi place when our other one went out of business.

There is a great variety of specialty rolls to choose from. Some are familiar combinations (Tootsie, Rainbow, Caterpillar, etc) but most of them are neat new creations. We highly recommend the Hot & Happy and the new Tuna & Tuna rolls. Wonderful!

Even though we went there for the sushi, the more traditional Japanese menu looked so interesting. We recently went for lunch specifically to try the sukiyaki and ramen dishes - WOW! We are going to have to go twice as often now so that we can have both.

One last thing - if you enjoy dining at local, non-chain establishments and feeling like your business is appreciated and the owners are truly happy to see you...look no further. From our first visit, we have felt like part of the \"family\" there and it makes us that much more anxious to return."}
{"text":"If you want real Japanese food this is the place!  Great Happy Hour appetizers and sushi all day long. Sushi is always fresh! A variety of authentic Japanese food that's all delicious! A great selection of Asian beers and alcohol. Sake Tasting party always great time! Service is friendly, Maggie and Toshi always make sure everything is perfect."}
{"text":"(got dinner takeout) Teriyaki chicken was a good amount and tasted good though was just the same as you could get at the mall (for half the price). Chicken Karaage was five small dry and overcooked thigh nuggets with no sauce of any kind. Paid $10.50 for each dinner which consisted of one of those types of chicken, white rice, a half cup of miso soup and a way too much wet iceberg mix tossed on top of the chicken which watered-down the teriyaki. Blech!
Employees were very friendly and environment was nice. If the meals were priced to reflect what you get, this could be a nice place for those quick dinners when you dont feel like cooking but is too high priced for daily fare and not enough umph for a special, higher priced dinner out."}
{"text":"This small place is decent for sushi in the desert.  Service was excellent.  Moochi (vanilla) was fab, tootsie roll good, hot and happy roll good.  What made it a deal was the tuesday 50% off.  Miso no tofu. We will return to try the ramen and for a tuesday sushi deal."}
{"text":"We knew Maggie and Toshi since they were still in running a restaurant in CA. We knew them for great food and great service. And when we got a chance to visit AZ, we made a special trip to visit their restaurant, and they are still pretty much the same. Serving good food! We enjoyed their sushi creations as well as their other dishes (Toshi's japanese curry is my husband's fav dishes). They have more sushi than before, and it seems 1 week is hardly enough time to try everything on the menu. I wish I can pack some and bring it to CA. 
Anyway, we recommend this restaurant for people that simply want to get a good Japanese food!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go for sushi and sake. The staff is so friendly and always putting on fun events like sake tastings. If you are looking for a top notch quality dining experience with the mom and pop feel, try them out. You will definitely  leave with a smile. :-)"}
{"text":"The service is always great and the sushi menu ranges from about $4-$12 it all depends on what you are willing to spend. For the price, the sushi is beautifully crafted and great! Definitely recommended. For those who aren't into sushi, there are a few choices for you too."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing menu. Lots of authentic Japanese dishes you can't easily find in other Japanese restaurants. You  can view some of their menu online. When you go into the restaurant there's a large wipe board with additional items and specials. They also have all day happy hour specials. The choices are a little overwhelming. Like someone else mentioned, their sushi selection is limited, but the selection they have is the more popular choices. Some of the shashimi was cut a little thick for my taste, but I suppose if you're paying that much you want more for your money. I'm just use to shashimi cut to a thickness where it just melts in your mouth. (No, not paper thin.) Service was great. Staff is friendly. Even the owner is greeting customers, and knew a number of customer's names.  Their green tea is actually green ( not yellow or brown) and authentic tasting. Pricing is in line with most other Japanese restaurants. The only sad thing is it's located in a shopping center that is mostly vacant, but they seem to have a good flow of customers."}
{"text":"I recently spent two months in Japan and was blown away by how good the food was, unfortunately my taste in Japanese food has much higher standards as a result. Fortunately Taiko is the one place in Arizona that I have found to give an authentic Japanese atmosphere and deliver great tasting food every time. The managers are so friendly, and greet every customer with an \"irasshaimase!\". I take many of my friends who like Japanese food to Taiko to give them a taste of what real japanese food is like."}
{"text":"I have had nothing but fabulous visits to Taiko. 
Mind you, I'm not sushi expert (or any other type of food, except maybe pizza...) and have only given sushi a go rather recently, but I love coming here for din or a quick bite on the weekend. 

My first experience here was for a friend's bachelorette party dinner meet-up. I was wearing purple tights. Not relevant to the review, but I was excited about them that night. We had made a reservation for 12 at 8pm on a Friday night. We got there a little early (10 min) and the table wasn't set up. In fact, all of their tables were full and the waitress informed us we would have to wait a bit until people finished & left so they could make room for us. 
After a 20ish minute wait, we were seated. Considering how not-ready they were when we arrived, I was completely happy with how quickly we were seated, although some others in our party were complaining. I didn't know until we arrived, but a table of 12 fills up their entire little dining room. All that was left was the booths against the windows and the bar seating. Though, as much as we were in the middle of the room, it didn't feel uncomfortable. The place is cozy.
The waitress was totally sweet to us and very apologetic about the table mishap at the beginning, which is really all you can ask. We got our table and our drinks quickly on a Friday night, so I was still impressed. She (the waitress whose name escapes me) was very knowledgeable on all their sake selections, and suggested a few good ones that we ordered for our table to sample. She also snapped a couple group pictures for us, and was very engaging to our big, loud group the whole time we were there.

Since then, I have gone to Taiko with my boyfriend probably 4 or 5 times. We love their happy hour menu, which is all day, every day, and offers a limited but decent selection of discounted sushi rolls, appetizers and drinks. It should also be mentioned that every time I'm here, there are families with children who seem very excited to be eating at Taiko. Yay for cool restaurants that are kid friendly and don't serve happy meals.
 Last time we went was again on a Friday, just as they were getting busy. We sat at the bar, and were served by the owner Toshi. He's superb - while skillfully preparing the orders for the restaurant, he also chatted with us and continually got us drinks, more wasabi, etc. When we left, we were bid goodbye multiple times by the waitresses, and the people working behind the bar. I felt cool on the way out, like a regular. I almost popped my collar, but didn't.
Probably should have."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE !!!! Definitely best sushi around . Im a sushi lover . Tried many places and this has to be one of the best sushi in town!! Staff is friendly , will do your order exactly as you asked. Might be a lil pricey for some but definitely worth every penny!"}
{"text":"I have always driven by this sushi place and wondered if it was any good.  It is literally at the end of a failing strip mall, but always seems to have cars parked there.  So one afternoon I called up a friend and suggested we give it a try and he readily agreed.

When we arrived, the place was packed and remained that way throughout our meal. I think it was a Friday night.  There were families, couples, younger kids, etc. 

The menu boasts happy hour all day on certain items and so we chose a couple of those as well as some of the specialty rolls. 

The good:  The place was clean, the sushi was YUMMY, and the service was prompt and friendly. As sushi normally does, the meal added up quickly (around $65 for two of us along with one drink each), but no major complaints.

The only bad:  One of the dishes I ordered was forgotten (a sea weed salad with seafood on it).  However we were still charged for it.  When I brought to the attention of someone, they offered to give it to us to go.  I thought that would work out ok - a snack for the following day. However, when I went to open up the salad the following day I found that all it contained was seaweed and cucumbers - not a speck of seafood.  :(  I was SOOO disappointed!)

I will definitely be back and will give this place another chance because the sushi was good.  But - I will make sure I get all of the dishes we ordered before the bill comes next time!"}
{"text":"Love this little place for sushi. They have all day happy hour! The rolls are a good size and quite tasty. The Shrimp Tempura and the Crunchy California Rolls are my favorite but I haven't found a bad one yet. Also love the miso soup and seaweed salad!"}
{"text":"Taiko is your best bet for sushi, as well as Japanese home cooking and soul food. There is something for EVERYONE here. They have your standard spicy tuna, salmon, eel rolls, as well as speciality rolls. They have katsu, fish, chicken teriyaki, tempura, all the bases covered.

Also - *ALL DAY HAPPY HOUR*. The prices are cheap for sushi and if you're looking to go beyond house sake, they always have a great selection.  

The service is really great and the owners, Toshi and Maggie, are usually around helping out, preparing sushi, and are extremely friendly. It's great to support such a cute, family business. I recommend it to everyone looking for a roll, a drink, or just real Japanese."}
{"text":"Really Great food! Really nice staff and very clean environment. I felt that the location was perfect for people who are not interested in large crowds and want fast efficient service."}
{"text":"In town for 14 days.  This is my 1st sushi in area.  It's Easter so it's just me & two Japanese couples in the establishment.  Hostess pleasant enough.  She, ala a The Price Is Right model, waved her arm from side to side saying \"You can sit anywhere\".  I elected to sit at the bar.  There's no leg room under the counter so I had to sit sort of side saddle.  Japanese music playing & wasn't overbearing.  
I ordered a Boston roll & a caterpillar roll.  Each was eight pieces.  I appreciated that the chef prepared the Boston first & presented it to me while the eel was still warming up.  The Boston was really good.  It's a California roll w/ spicy tuna on top.  Now that I think about it the spicy tuna was actually ground fresh tuna w/ a splash of Sriracha sauce added topside. The caterpillar was very good below the eel sauce.  The chef just poured it on a little too liberally.  I ended up scraping some of it off the sides.  Otherwise perfect.  There is a photo album that newbies can ask for which both depicts the sushi & a description of the contents.  
I'll try the other sushi town before returning here but could be very happy ordering same as this time."}
{"text":"I was in Chandler for work and wanted sushi for the 2nd night. You can also read my review of the other sushi place. Found this place that's close to my hotel. 
I went during a week night (Wed). When I went in, it was quite empty. The waitress greeted and seated me immediately. I had to say she had the best smile. It made you smile right back. I ordered some sushi and appetizer. The agedashi tofu was in a thick brown sauce. That's probably the worst of all the things I ordered. Not authentic at all. The calamari was good and the sushi was fresh and the rice portion and taste was also perfect. I even enjoyed the snow drop rolls. (I seldom order rolls). 
The waitress was very attentive and friendly. As the night went on, more people came in and the owner greeted all the regular patrons. You can tell this is a family business and you felt like you were eating at home. The teenage couple behind me was super cute. The guy was a first-timer to try sushi and the girl was trying to teach him everything!
Overall, excellent experience. Very relaxing, great food, super friendly waitress with an awesome smile. 
I am still smiling now when I am writing this review. :D"}
{"text":"Taiko used to be soooo good! I would always come for their sushi and ramen. I was never sure of why their agedashi tofu sauce had so much cornstarch in it but because it tasted good, I just went with it.

Unfortunately, my recent visit was horrible. The service was decent but the sushi and sashimi was absolutely DISGUSTING. I hope they were just having an off day because the fish tasted like it was just barely defrosted and had an awful gummy texture.

For now, I'd recommend sticking with their kitchen items *shudders*."}
{"text":"I went here this past weekend with a few of my friends. This place is awesome. 

The sushi is colorful, and there is a wide selection (they give you a picture book to flip through so you can really see what you're getting). The fish is fresh and the whole roll is flavorful. Their miso is well balanced and came out piping hot. I had a sukiyaki bowl. The meat was cooked well, but not dry. Everything was very moist and yummy. One of the best bowls I've ever had at a restaurant. 

My cousin had a katsu bowl. Also very moist and flavorful. She loved it. 

The prices are awesome. Esp. now that there is a non-stop happy hour. You can really get a lot of food for not a lot of price. The food tastes really good and the service isn't bad. It's worth driving out to Chandler to eat here. I really wish I lived closer so I could go here more often."}
{"text":"We get the Philadelphia and crunchy California rolls mostly as they are reasonably priced. We have had the Boston and Las Vegas rolls as well.  You really cannot go wrong here, the happy hour prices are really great as well.

Service is always on point and friendly.  The place is small and cozy.  It is a solid go to for us."}
{"text":"Decent service. She was friendly but not above and beyond, just average. The food was good and prices were great! Only one small tv in the bar area though. The tootsie roll and las Vegas roll are super good! I wouldn't say it was the best sushi ever but prices were great and service wasn't bad that's why I gave it a 3 stars"}
{"text":"This is a very nice and cozy sushi place. I really like the 1/2 price tuesday sushi specials, I hope they continue to do that. I eat at Taiko on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I enjoyed our lunch here and will return. My sushi combo lunch meal was good and enjoyable. The fish was fresh. I didn't feel it was melt in your mouth eye-rolling fab, but it was solid, decent sushi. The tempura mixed veggies were a winner too. 
My husband ate some kind of freshwater eel rice bowl with an egg on top. Sounds interesting but it wasn't. He coupled this with a salad of spicy?? and that too was boring. 
The service was excellent and the restaurant busy with two groups descending at the same time. We will come back for some sushi and sake another time. Love the the mom and pop, neighborhood vibe."}
{"text":"When I was in Japan I ate at 3 different restaurants that were exactly like this.

I suggest the pork Katsudon, there Unagi is great as well."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  It's owner-operated and the owners and their staff are friendly and remember us every time we go.  
The food is EXCELLENT.  The fish is always very fresh and beautifully prepared.  I usually stay very far away from the specialty rolls at places, but theirs are really cool and very tasty.  They have a specialty roll w/ crayfish (Louisiana Roll I think) that's totally different than any other roll I've had.  
They have different specials every night(1/2 rolls, 1/2 apps, etc) so try going different nights of the week to see what's up.
Also they have GREAT non-sushi Japanese food, it's worth a try.  I had a bento style meal w/ cooked mackerel that was very tasty.  My wife and I go here often and plan on continuing to do so."}
{"text":"Great little sushi place in Chandler. 

This was my first time here so I can't give it 5 stars just yet, I want to see consistency. Yes, I will go back. I didn't have a bad or even so-so piece of sushi. I had the salmon, ahi tuna, albacore, yellowtail, scallops, and eel (like to keep it simple the first time). Had some rolls (50% of Tuesday) pretty standard. The spicy rolls were not overwhelming with spicy sauce as if they were trying to cover up an inferior fish like I have seen done before at other places. Small selection of sake, I have come to expect very little of the sake society in Arizona. 

Over all good experience, I would recommend, and I will return soon."}
{"text":"Small place, cozy atmosphere, cheap prices. Tootsie roll is good. Alaska roll is good. Don't recommend getting edamame, it's $2.00 for a tiny plate of edamame that all taste different (some good, some bad, kinda like they mixed the old with the new). Miso soup tastes like it came in powdered form and they just added water."}
{"text":"A great sushi bar owned and operated by Maggie and Toshi who are both Japanese.  Their product is always consistent and they always have a few good specials.   Service is great and the staff is very friendly and cheerful.  Value is really good particularly within their happy hour menu.    

Our kids love it and they are always spoiled rotten by Maggie and Toshi so it is their favorite place.    

Lastly we did a sake tasting there a few weeks ago and really had a great time.  We all sat family style int he middle of the restaurant and got to experience some really interesting rice wines.  We had a blast.

Great place"}
{"text":"SAKE bombs!  We went for the monthly sake tasting and had a blast!!! Had no idea there were so many flavors of sake. I had a strawberry, dry, hot, and sparkling and they were all wonderful.

This place is AWESOME!!! 

They really have it all.... Great food, amazing service, phenomenal prices! You really can't go wrong. It's a family owned business and you can really feel it. They have some awesome specialty rolls and all your traditional sushi rolls as well. Oh and did I mention Happy Hour all day everyday!!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for authentic Japanese; they even have a special Japanese-specific menu that's not normally given out that has a ton of good stuff on it.

I've been here 3 or 4 times in the past month with my wife and the food is always excellent, and the staff always friendly.  Prices are reasonable.

If you're looking for super-Americanized sushi they can make it but you'll be better off at Ra/Kona Grill or somewhere where the club music is blasting at eight million db."}
{"text":"One of the few places in the valley I can say I am treated like family every time I come in, and that is saying a lot! Great food, surprisingly friendly atmosphere, and service is always great! My only recommendation is perhaps changing their green tea recipe, as it always tastes strange when I order it. I don't know if the sushi chef is the owner or just an employee, but he shows a great deal of friendliness to his customers and seems to be a genuinely kind human being."}
{"text":"Delicious! A nice hole in the wall place with some of the best sushi I've had."}
{"text":"I like this Japanese Restaurant, fancy and nice. My friend and I order a plate of sushi..I don't remember the name of it. But it was good. At first they forgot about my order, but they were very nice and said our order will be ready soon. They offered a mini dish with eel and this noodle thing I think because they missed my order. That was very considerate. It's a great place, I recommend others to go."}
{"text":"Worst place I've ever ate!!! Bathroom dirty debit machine didn't work! Didn't tell us before we ordered and then wanted us to leave credit card info with them!! Had to leave and go get cash to pay the bill and it was my husbands bday. Only pic this place cause it had almost stars so we drove from Glendale to check it out. Huge mistake. Who ever put almost five stars is crazy!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Been here a few times, but it's hard to eat good food with the kids. Had to eat here for New Year's Eve. Husband left happy and full. The yellow tuna collar was so fresh and tasty, the fried soft shell crabs was nice and crunchy, and the teriyaki beef was delicious. Maggie was so nice that she appreciated us for waiting she gave our boys strawberry ice cream, which they ate till the bowl was spotless. We shall be back ^_^"}
{"text":"Seriously the best sushi in the AZ. I've been to over 15-20 in the valley. The owner, Toshi, knows his craft coming from Japan.  His nigiri is cut exquisitely, as well as the maki rolls. Do yourself a favor and have dinner here in this mom and pop sushi joint you won't regret it."}
{"text":"When my hubby and I arrived at the restaurant, it had just opened and there were only two of us dining inside. I tried uni, scallop, giant clam and toro sushi. I think uni and scallop were fresh, but I don't know why the sea urchin was really cold (put in the fridge for too long?), the rice and laver weren't very good, while the toro was full of tendon, and the giant clam had a bit of weird water taste. I would expect better quality because they only had to serve two customers at that time.

We also ordered ramen but I think the miso ramen was too salty, and the noodles a bit hard (of course shouldn't be too tender). The shouyu one was better. The waitress was nice though.

I guess I'm just not a fan of Taiko. A bit disappointed after reading the raves from Yelp. This is the first time we went there but probably won't go again. For this price, I'd choose to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went for great sushi based on the reviews and found a mediocre experience. This isn't a place you will find fresh seafood, with innovation.  You will find lots of imitation crab though and one highlight was the service was impeccable."}
{"text":"I still kinda like this place, but they lost one star due to them taking beef off the menu.  Whoever heard of a Japanese restuarant with no beef teriyaki, or beef sukiyaki, or beef of any kind?  Kinda crazy if you ask me."}
{"text":"I was here 4 years ago and came back yesterday, still amazing.  Maggie is wonderful, food is authenic.  Love this place, will return for sure."}
{"text":"This is a review I've been meaning to write for a while, because I LOVE this place.  My wife and I live within walking distance from ASU campus in Tempe...not exactly limited in sushi options.  So why do we drive 30 minutes to Chandler to get our sushi?  Three things make Taiko our hands-down choice, over 4 places that we can walk to easily and countless others in the Valley.

First is the quality of the food, in particular the quality of the fish.  They have a ton of fancy rolls, but if you know your sushi and want to be blown away, order something very simple first...say, a salmon nigiri.  The freshness of the ingredients and skill in preparation are really exceptional.  Even the miso soup is the best I've had, and if you want to treat yourself, try a Taiko Roll next...a real feast for all the senses!  Oh...and DON'T forget the sake!  They have a really great selection, and are knowledgeable enough to make some great recommendations.

So, speaking of the people...that's the second reason that I'm disappointed if I go elsewhere.  Maggie and Toshi are such wonderful people - friendly, genuine, hard-working, and they LOVE what they do.  After three visits, Maggie was already our stand-in mom...I don't know of anywhere else where I get a hug as I come in the door!  If you're a regular, they'll make food recommendations (even special off-menu items), and we always leave feeling like we've been visiting with family (the ones you like).  The staff are efficient and attentive, and I don't believe I've ever received an incorrect order.

Finally (if you aren't already there enjoying a caterpillar roll by now), there are the special events.  Get on their e-mail list and like them on Facebook to get in on TONS of awesome special occasions, including all-you-can-eat parties, sake tastings (A REALLY FANTASTIC EVENING!!), and special seasonal meals.  Going there is always a blast, but being part of the selected crowd for a sake tasting is really a special experience!

Taiko, we love you...I think it's about time to go back!"}
{"text":"Taiko has been the place to go for me!  They have great service and take care of me all the time.  Variety of sake, and great place to drink.  I would recommend all my friend to come here."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood sushi place. We love the service of this family owned business. Try the Arizona Roll YUMMY!"}
{"text":"We happened to find a good review and decided to pay a lunch visit to the establishment. It was very good and prices were reasonable. I enjoyed the happy hour appetizers and the meal itself was very filling. I will definitely go back when I am in town again this time with the real reviewers in town...my children."}
{"text":"This place is PHENOMENAL! 

A friend and I were looking for a Sushi spot out of the norm (ie. Ra, Kona, Kabuki, ect). We saw Taiko on Yelp and saw all the positive reviews and star ratings so we figured we'd try it out. Doesn't look like much from the outside but upon walking in you can feel the family owned nature of it. It is extremely authentic and absolutely delicious. Prompt service met with kind staff. 

We ordered the Vegas Rolls and the Tootsie Rolls. Both were phenomenal. We also ordered the plum wine and that was nothing short of amazing. To end we had the green tea and red bean ice cream. By far, the best ice cream we've ever had in our lives. 

We went on a Saturday night and noticed them putting a long table together with several bottles of saki on top. We then learned they have saki tastings for up to 18 people accompanied by a violin player. The staff had several usuals as we noticed they would call them by name as they entered.

Wonderful place that we will definitely be visiting again very soon!"}
{"text":"Another friend fail...

She told me that this place is owned by a Japanese couple, therefore the food must be authentic.  I trusted her coz she's Asian.  What is up with my Asian friends not knowing what authentic is!  First of all, sushi is not traditionally drizzled with sweet eel sauce!  Secondly, I hate it when Krab and mayo is used as a filler.  Both of these method tell me that the true flavor of the raw fish is masked.  The tako was like rubber!  The salmon was the best one of all.  

They run happy hour all day at half off the original price of $4 to $12, a plus!  I also love the decor, very chic!  I have to give them credit for great service.
The tempura shrimp and veggies are soggy and tasteless.  Almost like the tempura batter had been sitting there for awhile.
I will have to go back to try their Shabu Shabu and other noodle dishes.  We may even sit at the bar and ask for their sashimi or sushi chef special, that might change my next review."}
{"text":"A few comments from my table tonight:
\"The Gyoza is perfect\"
\"I can't believe I paid so much money at Benihana to be served by a hispanic chef and a caucasian waiter\"
\"I want to come back\"
The food was pretty good, I probably ate too much as the miserable sensation creeps in ... what I was seriously digging on?  The people.  I have a huge heart for Japan and it was really cool to see fresh young Japanese faces working, enjoying conversation with the locals.  I found myself thinking I wanted to be that person at the bar talking about whatever came up.  Maybe get in on a language lesson or two.  For me, it's about the culture - not just how a restaurant can thrill me with their menu - although, I am wondering when I can go back :)  One of the staff took the time to present my daughters with the most delicate cut carrot butterflies - I was so impressed.  I wish I could keep it forever!  Please give it a try!"}
{"text":"I still continue going to this restaurant. Best place in town, for sure. The sushi is always very fresh, the food is delicious and service is great. Joshi and his wife, Maggie are very nice people, as is the staff. They no longer play the hectic music I mentioned 2 years ago. I just LOVE that place. Prices are also great."}
{"text":"We walked in and as always, were greeted with a smile - the owner remembered us, and where we liked to sit at the sushi bar. We had the yellow tail sashimi, rainbow roll, spicy tuna roll, and AZ roll. Our fav sushi by far-  the sushi chefs are friendly and ask you with a smile if you are enjoying their beautiful sushi creations. At the advise of our wonderful waitress at the bar - we had the tempura ice cream which was a perfect way to finish our meal. The staff there always makes is feel welcome.  When we leave there, we always feel like they have made us a part of their family.  Wonderful experience as always - we will return soon - again and again!"}
{"text":"Good variety on the menu.  All types of yummy Japanese food like sushi, ramen, udon, and katsu curry.  Very nice people own the restaurant and the service is good.  It's nice to go to a more traditional Japanese restaurant with more than sushi/sashimi and teriyaki chicken on the menu."}
{"text":"We love Taiko!  Maggie and Toshi are wonderful, and the sushi is absolutely top notch.  We love the Arizona Roll and the Hot & Happy Roll.  Stop in and see them - you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I was told to try this place out by a Sushi chef for a fine dining Scottsdale place. He said it was the best sushi in the valley. After my first visit I was happily able to agree. I go there every week now and I am completely addicted to the Candy Cane roll! It is fantastic fresh and affordable sushi. They have wonderful specials every day and their desserts are delicious!!! 
I can't recommend this place enough!!!!"}
{"text":"Waited in two dirty white chairs by the door, looked at two empty tables adjoining other tables with people seated. Patrons at these tables saw us sitting by the door and mentioned to the waiter to separate the tables to allow us to sit. The waiter said no. We passed the time looking at the mock food in the showcase in the front, looked good but couldn't find the same items by the same name in the menu. Even if they had the best food in the world, it wouldn't have made up for the service. Besides, who puts white cloth chairs in their dining room? If the front was that dirty, it makes you wonder about the state of their kitchen where the food is prepared. Will not be back. Ever. Spent 30 minutes of my life in this restaurant and left without eating. Disaster."}
{"text":"Had dinner w/ family last night.  Miso soup was very good.  The seaweed salad & the sushi rolls were very fresh & tasty.  Service was very friendly but a bit slow, because there was only 1 waitress.  She was running ragged serving all the tables.  I understand the reason for only 1 waitress.  Helped out by being patient. 

Definitely a recommend and will be back.  Will try other dishes next visit.
:-)"}
{"text":"Taiko Sushi is one my favorite (and I only have 3) family-owned local sushi restaurants.  From my very first time there, Maggie and Toshi, Dai, May, and Daphne have made me feel welcome and at home.  

The menu is diverse; with sashimi, sushi, noodles, and other delicious asian entrees that are all very affordable.  They also have home-made flan and ice cream.

They have a once a month Sake Tasting event, which is so much fun either by yourself to meet others, or with a date, or with a group of friends.  

I love going to Taiko even if I'm by myself, sitting up at the bar area and chatting with the owners and staff."}
{"text":"It's a small hole in the wall place that my boyfriends co worker told him about. We went for his birthday dinner . The place is small with a few booths and tables but clean. The service was good and we didn't have to wait long to get our food. They have happy hour all day everyday so the price is pretty good. The food was good but not great. I really like the baked salmon and baked  scallops and the fried tofu appetizer. Do not get the fried calamari! No flavor and it just tasted like tempura batter"}
{"text":"I don't know 
What Taiko's got 
But it plays with my emotions (and stomach)
I want so much
\"Sake\", I want to hold you near
Want the taste of sweet and tender sushi on....my tongue
Can't stand the thought of it in somebody's mouth
Got to have your taste, got to have it all....to myself
I say yeah..yeah....yeah yeah

Want to go to Taiko's, Taiko's mmmm
Want to go to Taiko's, Taiko's, Taiko Restaurant
Want to go to Taiko's, Taiko's, Taiko Restaurant
(Billy Ocean - Loverboy lyrics)

Taiko is located off Cooper and Ray in South Chandler.  I love this mom and pop shop simply because I enjoy supporting our local businesses.  The also serve up some great food and fun.  

At least once a month Taiko has a sake tasting gathering.  At happy hour prices and shots of exotic sake; what's not to like?  Maggie one of the owners travels to sake conventions and orders them from all over the country to get these delicate drinks.  For $15 a head, you'll get 5 shots of the Sake of your choice all laid out on the table.  They have everything from filtered sake, nonfiltered sake, canned sake, box sake, and sparkling sake.  What does that all mean?  I really don't know since I'm not a big sake connoisseur.  However, I do recommend you try it at least once to experience it.  

Along with your sake tasting, Taiko offers happy hour dishes that are super affordable.  This doesn't mean their food quality sucks.  It means it's cheap and good!  This was the first place I ordered a fried fish head.   Yep, eyes and lip still attached.  Needless to say, I'm in love with this dish.  If you don't know the tenderest meat comes from the cheeks.  Also, I was a virgin to Uni until I came to Taiko.  My first taste of Uni, well let's just say it was like my first kiss; awkward!  Can't say I'm a big fan of Uni, but if you put it in a shot of sake and quail eggs - we're golden!  Yum!  As you can see I go for the exotic ingredients.

Service here is tops.  Maggie and her staff is very friend and will treat you like family, literally.  Maggie is amazing since the time I first attended; she still remembers me by name and welcomes me!  During sake tastings they always have live entertainment.  Kevin one of the musical performers always brings along his violin or guitar to serenade you while you enjoy your sake and food.  Such an awesome atmosphere! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My friend Stephen and I went here for lunch today.  

He ordered the Chicken Teriyaki & Chicken Karaage lunch combo.  It came with miso soup, salad, rice, and 2 kinds of chicken.  I tried his chicken Karaage, it was very tasty, and salty - fried pieces of chicken.  He seemed to enjoy it very much.

He also ordered california rolls which he ate only 2 of.  I took the rest.  They were standard.

I ordered the seaweed salad, very tasty, fresh and crunchy. YUM!

I also had the tootsie roll and the spicy tuna roll.  The tootsie roll was pretty good... nothing wrong with it, but it didn't wow me.  The spicy tuna seemed off to me, I think the texture was  a bit mushy?  It wasn't very good... Spicy tuna is my favorite roll and I have to say I was kinda disapointed.

The service was ok, our waitress was quick and efficient, but not very smiley or friendly.

Bottom line: I've had better and I probably wouldnt take Morgan or Dom here... still searching for good sushi in Chandler/Gilbert :o)"}
{"text":"The sushi here is not the greatest. Not a very good selection and the rolls lacked in flavor. Definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Food was ok. I won't be back though.
Service was good.
Selection of sake was very....impressive!"}
{"text":"Taiko is a local, family owned business that I like to support. Been coming here on and off for about a year now and will continue to do so. Come here for both the sushi and the Ramen. I love their Shoyu Ramen! Order it almost every time. Have tried the Miso Ramen and wihile it's okay, it is a bit bland. Thus, the Shoyu Ramen which is soy based. The salmon, yellowtail, octopus, and sweet shrimp sushi are very good. The sweet shrimp is served with the head and the head is fried. Dipped in a bit of soy sauce and it's delicious! Sometimes order the Louisiana Roll, which I like as well. If I get here really hungry, I'll order the Spicy squid salad or garden salad with some edamame. Their seaweed is good but it comes as a very small portion so I no longer bother. Overall I have a great experience everytime."}
{"text":"It's just another Ok Sushi place.  The calamari that was fried was like rubber but the Tofu was amazing.  I will probably not return."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I LOVE THIS PLACE

With the reasons why to follow....

1. The Food is Awesome, I have not even got to try the regular menu items yet but mainly just the happy hour rolls as there are plenty to choose from 6 dollars and below.  I love me a good deal and this is definitely that. 6-8 rolls for under 6 dollars is amazing.  The crunch CA rolls philidelphia and spicy tuna for instance are not very big to where you are just thinking GEEZE Insanely good deal...But more like you get what you pay for and it is well worth it.  Once you get up to the 5/6 dollar rolls they get a little bigger. Next time I will have pics to show off the rolls. :)

2.The SERVICE I cannot give enough stars for this. It is a family owned business and the owners are beyond amazing! Extremely considerate and will remember everyone's names the first time if you strike up a conversation.  The first time we went, Maggie let us know about sake tasting night that is once a month for $15 for 5 tickets to try different sakes with a on the house tostada for your arrival.  She let us know of a taxi service that is supposed to be  the owner of this Taxi line(VIP Taxi)  with coupons for using their service.  So the night of Sake tasting night 7/28/2012, we called VIP taxi and had to wait an hour and a half and the dispatcher made up excuses for why the taxi took so long( finding out that the drivers are never really given correct info just an idea of where these people could possibly be) anyways long story short, Maggie ended up giving us a ride home down the street from their restaurant because she felt bad that they werent pronto as she thought they would be since she knows the owner.  That is some GREAT service. I have found 2 businesses that I will be forever loyal too b/c of the owners. If you want good service come here! (or pittsburgh willys for sandwiches/perogies/ milkshakes and hot dogs) 

My boyfriend and I agreed that this is the last place that we will be going for sushi from now on. :)"}
{"text":"So amazing. This place is extremely authentic, friendly, and great prices. Happy hour is great! We had three rolls, appetizers, and an entree for under $50. If you're in the area you need to come check this place out. The little Japanese lady is so cute and humbling."}
{"text":"We were looking for sushi that isn't Ra or Blue Wasabi. Someplace that isn't the bar scene and has good sushi. We have been here 2 times now and have been very happy with the sushi. It isn't fancy or flashy but takes care of our craving for sushi. Very mom and pop feel and the employees are all very nice. Highly recommend for a stop for some sushi."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Always greeted with a smile and welcome.  Great little family run restaurant.  We usually go on Tuesday night when they have a good selection of half price or discounted items.  They also have a Sunday All you can eat special.  The quality is always as good as the hospitality."}
{"text":"Love the sushi at this place!  They have lots of creative choices."}
{"text":"Dont let the size of the restaurant fool you, the staff is always friendly and the sushi is expertly done.  I have never had something I did not like here."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been regulars since Taiko opened several years ago, but even if you've never visited before, Maggie, Toshi and their great staff will make you feel like regulars. The restaurant itself is clean and inviting, and Japanese pop music plays at a volume that permits normal conversation. If you sit at the bar, you can catch whatever game happens to be on that night, as well.

What really makes the atmosphere, however, is the staff. Taiko's waitresses are attentive and friendly and the restaurant enjoys minimal turnover which means they get to know their customers. Maggie is always on the floor making sure guests are having a great experience. 

Taiko's nigiri and sashimi are as fresh and delicious as any we had growing up in Florida. They have all the \"standards,\" but what really sets Taiko apart is the fact that there is almost always something you won't find everywhere else; it might be Spanish mackerel, bluefin, oysters on the half shell, or something else, but you can always count on finding a special treat on any given night.

Taiko has happy hour specials on appetizers (and beer) all week. The spicy squid salad and agadeshi tofu are both excellent, and a big bottle of ice-cold Koshihikari Echigo is a great way to wash down dinner. Oh, and the ginger squid will make your head spin.

They have a number of rolls, both traditional norimaki and the inside-out rolls preferred by most Americans. If a roll developed for Western palates in the 1970's is what you consider \"traditional,\" you might be disappointed to find that some of the different iterations of the California roll served at Taiko (and any other US sushi bar) are, in fact, drizzled with a little eel sauce. However, Maggie will gladly provide the uninitiated with a book of pictures; if you don't like eel sauce, just peek at the photos and order without. If you want a great dressed up Cali roll, the Boston and Alaska rolls are both fantastic, as is the candy cane roll with its garnish of fresh tomatoes and green onions. For a special treat, order the tootsie roll, full of tender tempura shrimp, but don't let the deliciously crispy tails go to waste.

Many of Taiko's best dishes aren't on the menu or specials board at all. Visit a few times and demonstrate an interest in eating \"off the beaten path,\" and Maggie will suggest something spectacular while sheepishly suggesting you might not like it because \"only Japanese usually order this...\" The yellowtail collar is one such dish and shouldn't be missed.

Taiko also serves tempura and teriyaki disheses, as well as some noodle dishes I'm told you can't find with any consistency in Japanese restaurants in the US, but we come for the sushi. Their beer and sake offerings are above average to excellent, and they are priced very reasonably. If you visit in the summer, be sure to order a glass of iced barley tea for something different.

In addition to being a skilled sushi chef, Toshi is also classically trained in French techniques and regularly produces specials that will rival any Pacific Rim fusion restaurant for quality and creativity. Even if there's not a special app or entree on the menu, diners are regularly treated to some homemade fresh fruit ice cream, flan, or another sweet bite after their meal.

Taiko also offers traditional dining experiences of Kaiseki and Shabu-Shabu, along with special sake tasting events, during some parts of the year. These special events are typically by reservation only. If you have any doubt about how traditional Taiko is, you only need to drop in for sushi when they're having one of these special events; you'll wonder if you haven't been transported across the Pacific--if you can get a table among all the happy Japanese transplants!

Overall, Taiko is a great place. Their sushi is consistently excellent, and you'll feel as though you're a welcome dinner guest at your Japanese friends' place. If you're not driving to Taiko when you go out for sushi in the Southeast Valley, you're just wasting gas."}
{"text":"Incredibly good sushi and exceedingly warm and friendly atmosphere. We moved across the country and it had been about 3 years since we were here but when Maggie saw us she remembered us immediately and greeted us with genuine friendship. They've got some new rolls on the menu since our last visit so we tried a few we hadn't had before. Our new favorite is the S&M roll, not sure of the significance of the name, (there was no leather or straps involved) but it was fabulous!!"}
{"text":"The food is sooo good:) I love love the pork kasu don. The presentation isnt great but dont let the look deceive you!  

The service is good too. Tbe girl was new and didn't know much of the menu but she did her best to find out and explain it to us. 

Im one happy customer:)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite mom and pop restaurants in the East Valley.  Food is authentic and always fresh.  I came in today for noodles. They did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Bright Pink Ginger is all I need to say to describe this place.  The rest of the experience was similar.  Food was blah, I was disappointed with one roll in particular because the soft shell crab was obviously not freshly fried, or even reheated.  It was cold, limp, and soggy.  

The rest of the food experience was average.  Service at the bar was good.  Too many other better sushi joints closer to my house for me to go back.

Bright pink ginger and best sushi in the valley are mutually exclusive."}
{"text":"Overdue review...
Upset! They would have received a higher rate but they've greatly dissapointed me. We went in for Mother's day and was rudely told  to leave because they only allow those who have made reservations ahead of time. My family has been going to their restaurant for quite awhile but to be treated that way was unacceptable. They should have put a sign up or even just explain it nicely to us would have worked.

Bottom line! Will not be going back...POOR customer service."}
{"text":"We came here last week for date night. We came in close to closing time but they were very pleasant. I've been some places where staff gets annoyed at late customers but I didn't get that vibe here. Sushi was very delicious. We tried a variety things and everything was excellent."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and had the following: 

-Sashimi appetizer 
-Calamari 
-Caterpillar role 
-Spicy salmon dynamite 

The sashimi was yummy, but the rolls were mediocre. The prices were a little high, but the staff was super friendly. 
I give it a solid three stars."}
{"text":"This sushi isn't just the best priced in town it's also the best in town! Staff is very nice and friendly. Also it's happy hour priced all day. I always get the lousiana roll and the Boston roll but I've never had something I didn't like here. Also if it's not on the menu ask and they will make it for you I wanted a negi hama roll once and they made it perfectly."}
{"text":"There are many good Sushi restaurants in the east Valley; however, what sets Taiko apart from the others is their noodles. Interestingly, you have to ask for the noodle menu. It isn't mentioned on their web-site nor did the waitress give us any indication that they had noodles until we asked. But once they realized we were there for real Japanese food; everything changed. Both the Ramen and Soba noodle dishes we tried were excellent. Once you try their noodles, you may say saronara to sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Read some of the reviews on here and thought I'd check it out. Small, cozy place-rather inviting. The food was very American- a lot of deep fried and heavy butter dishes. Edamame was soggy, squid salad was deep fried and everything else was average at best. The service was good and everyone was very nice..... I won't go back.  If you like American-ized sushi, you might like it and it's very inexpensive."}
{"text":"This was such a friendly and welcoming mom and pop Japanese restaurant. We used a coupon (Thank you Michael Romero) and got a discount on the already low price. We celebrated by son's 15th birthday and had a great time. Something for everyone. We left happy and sated. Wonderful food, wonderful service."}
{"text":"This place is great! It is so quaint and homey, and that's one of the many reasons I love it.  They offer your traditional sushi rolls,  plus a few new and unique options.  Everything is fresh and delicious,  and I love that they use a light tempura batter.  Staff is SO nice,  and you can tell they genuinely care about their customers.  Can't wait to come back for their monthly sake tasting event."}
{"text":"Great authentic Japanese restaurant. Everything taste great and all freshly cook/served. Toshi the owner has a great personality. The dishes he made simply representing his way of treating life - carefully designed and enjoy it to the fullest. We started visiting Maggie and Toshi's little restaurant 3 or 4 years ago and we never stop going back since then. My friends like them, my wife and my daughter like them and of course, i like them very very much! If you are looking for authentic Japenese cuisine here in the Sun Valley, you have to come and try out Toshi's."}
{"text":"Great sushi place for all sort of groups. I usually hate sushi, friend recommended las vegas sushi, and it has converted me to the good side. Love the atmosphere in this place."}
{"text":"Things I love
- family run and you can definitely feel it
- there is a picture for almost everything on the sushi menu 
- there are a LOT of things on the menu 
- this place is cheap!
- service

The food was decent. It was good for the price you pay. I will be back"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for the first time this week, even though it's right down the street from my house! I was pleasantly surprised by the service and the sake selection. We had an assortment of food, a couple appetizers, an entree, and some sashimi. I wouldn't rave about it being 5 star, but it was definitely good! The menu isn't huge but it's enough that we would like to go back. We already signed up for their next sake sampling...hopefully our next visits will be as enjoyable and it will be a new go-to neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"Dont eat at Taiko Japanese restaurant in Chandler. The owner's wife is a witch. The waitress brought us the wrong order. I told her it was wrong and she said the owner said because your pork chop was small he sent this. Then the witch comes as my son and I are eating it and yells at me that i got a wrong order and i should not have eaten it. . I said but I told waitress I didn't order this and she told me it was okay. The witch says. Okay well I wont charge you for your pork appetizer and the wrong order. She then proceeded to yell at all the staff and owner for 30 minutes in front of customers. Then the witch acts like she did me a favor and charged me for the appetizer after she said she would write it off. I asked her why as she had told me she was taking them both off and she said, I should charge you for both and your pork was a large piece, a dinner size, so I decided to charge you for that. It was not a big piece nor did she see it. So how does she know? The sushi fish also stated old.  What a stressful situation.  Poor customer service."}
{"text":"The owners, the food, the cocktails. Everything is perfect. We've been coming here since they opened 8+ years ago and it is our favorite sushi place hands down."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly but I was not impressed with the quality of the food. I ordered the Philadelphia, Boston, and Spicy Tuna rolls and I've had much better rolls at other restaurants."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best, if not best, sushi spots in the valley! Its a far drive for me, but well worth it to get authentic, good quality, tasty japanese food! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Taiko for a while decided to stop by for dinner on a Saturday evening.  They  have all day happy hour on certain rolls but prices listed on the sushi menu were a bit confusing.  They have the regular price and hh price next to the selective rolls. If all day hh, why list the regular price?  It's probably listed so you know how much you are saving on a roll.  

This might not be a place for you if you are expecting fresh fishes. Stick with the cooked sushi or fried rolls.  I had ordered the rainbow and Vegas rolls.  Vegas roll was loaded with too much sauce that made the roll soggy.  Rainbow was decent and pretty standard sushi. 

I am a huge fan of ramen.  I was extremely disappointed on their tonkotsu ramen.  It was one of the blandest broth ever.  You might be better off making it from an instead noodle packet."}
{"text":"I love this small mom and pop restaurant owned by actual Japanese! Right when you enter the place they have a glass encased display of a lot of their dishes just like they have in Japan. There are a lot of traditional Japanese dishes here in addition to sushi. They have very cool specials everyday and they are listed on their website. We went on a Sunday which is 50% off selected appetizers and sushi roll deals. There were a lot of appetizers to choose from for the special and we got the fried baby calamari on salad with spicy ponzu dressing ($3)and it was soooo good! We also got seaweed salad which was good and only $2.25! I got the combination dinner which included shrimp &veggie tempura and sashimi and it was all excellent and the fish was so fresh and melted in my mouth. My hubby got the Chirashi bowl and he loved it so much he ate the entire thing (big bowl).  We will totally return since it's in our neighborhood and they have a lot of different dishes to return for, including ramen!"}
{"text":"Good quality sushi.  Smaller portions, but they are nice and fresh.  I got my usual smoked salmon nigiri, and it was excellent.  The yellow tail was great.  Service was attentive. I would go back for sure!"}
{"text":"You know what? This place was great. I had the S&M sushi and the everyone ate the rolls in a jiffy. Now for appetizers O suggest soft shell crab. The udon was good as well. The sake I tried was great as it had the right kick. For now this is the best authentic place in AZ. Must try.

And of course the ladies were nice."}
{"text":"I recently started working in the S Chandler/Gilbert area and am looking for a great lunch spot.  I decided to try Taiko because their lunch combos look like a great deal and sadly I was disappointed.

Currently the restaurant has happy hour specials all day long and now I am wishing I had gone that route.  I ordered the Chicken Karaange combo with a California Roll which came with Miso Soup, salad, steamed rice and \"seasonal fruit\" all for $8.50.  Other lunch combos are $10.99-$12.99 which isn't bad but is pricey for lunch.  

The Miso soup and salad were great but the rest of my meal was disappointing.  The California roll was 4 small pieces, it was delicious but the portion was sad.  The Chicken Karaange was 5 pieces of chicken each around the size of a golf ball but when I bit into them they were mostly gristly dark meat.  The reason I wrote seasonal fruit with quotations around it is because the fruit I got on my plate was a quarter of an orange or basically a drink garnish.

Overall I can usually get around 2 eats out of a lunch that promises all that food but I left with a stomach full of miso soup, salad and rice.
I will definitely be back to try their happy hour specials but will cross this off as a lunch option.  My meal total with tax (no drink) and tip was $10 and was not worth it."}
{"text":"I wanted sushi AND happy hour one fine evening.. So of course I had to go to Yelp..

My friend and I came here this past weekend. We ordered the Philly roll, Vegas roll, Avocado roll, & the spicy salmon dynamite. I liked the Spicy Salmon Dynamite. Everything else was mediocre, nothing special. We washed everything down with some Cabernet. 

The thing that did it for me was that they have happy hour all day everyday and they have very reasonable prices. Their drink specials are also really good and I heard they even have Sake tastings here. Not to mention it's like down the street from my house.If you go to their website they even have coupons where you can get 20% off your bill. (doesn't apply to hh though). 

It wasn't anything amazing but I'll definitely be back when I'm in the mood for some sushi and happy hour since we're neighbors. =)"}
{"text":"Taiko has the best authentic Japanese food around!  Maggie and Toshi are super nice and their staff is amazing.  Then there's the food...Toshi is a master, making all of his own sauces and creating many of the sushi choices himself.  Being Japanese, my first measure of the quality of sushi is to try miguro and himachi and Taiko always exceeds my expectations.  I also recommend the baked scallops, catepillar roll and if you like a little spice, try the candy cane sushi, my personal favorite.  The quality of food they use is impressive here in the desert.  My family and I go there every chance we get...every birthday, every holiday, every chance.    I highly recommend this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Finally tried Taiko for dinner for daughter's birthday last week. I prefer lunch time, simply because it's not as busy! It was nice to know that they do get business though, considering the shopping center is pretty much deserted. Had to wait a little longer, but the food was just as good and worth it. My husband, who is not sushi fan, didn't really like the chicken teriyaki. It comes with a salad, and the dressing on the salad mixed with the teriyaki sauce, which made it taste rather bad to him. I would suggest asking for separate plates should you order it. Other than that, I definitely will be back, over and over again!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Good, simple, and fast. We live across the street from this place. We always drove by but never stopped. We decided to go one day and we never stopped going."}
{"text":"Taiko has to be one of the best Japanese places I have been in the valley.  The menu has a lot more than just sushi.  Sushi is amazing and great, but there is a lot more variety to Japanese food than just sushi.  I got a chicken yakisoba which had a nice crisp sweet taste to it.  There were many variety of vegetables that brought a fresh taste to the yummy noodle dish.

The owner and servers are very family friendly, as my friend knows them all very well.  I asked my friend why she would not take out if she came so often here and lived very close. She said part of the fun is hanging out with the people who work at the restaurant and getting some latest news from Japan.  That unique factor makes this an actual experience than just eating simple food on your plate."}
{"text":"4.5 if I could....

So its my birthday and my wife hunts down \"Phoenix's Best Sushi\" and comes up with this place near our home in Chandler.  Now I have friends just to the east of this intersection and I NEVER noticed this place before.  In an empty shopping center (basically) and very nondescript.

So we walk in and I was like OK. Tiny place, limited seating and two steps you are at the sushi bar.  Ambiance I learned is not why you  go here.

Sat down and learned its always HAPPY HOUR at Taiko.  So good priced rolls and Saki Bombers for $6.99.  Good deal.

I had my two kids with me (along with my wife) and besides a Cali roll none of them are Sushi eaters.  My daughter LOVED the Miso Soup I tasted it and it was very good also. She also got the Chicken Katsu which was very good.

My son raved about the Cali roll he took that down in about 3 minutes flat.  My wife went with the beef teryiaki and the meat was actually cooked medium rare.  I was shocked.  It was good and flavorful.  So that part was for the non-Japanese eaters you may have.

I decided to have a feast.  I tried their Blue Fin Tuna, which was spectacular, had some great yellow tail, some of the freshest I have had since moving here.  Followed that up with my all time favorite sushi which is spicy scallops.  And they were spicy and tasty.  Loved them.  I also tried the Salmon Dynamite roll.  While something I may not order again, it was very good and had different flavor.  While eating my wife was reading review and said the fun is trying something new like Hamachi Kama.  Now this is one of my all time favorite dishes and asked for an order.  The watiress was like, you like Hamachi Kama and smiled?  Within a few minutes the owner brought it over with an even bigger smile.  It was great.

Just a quick stepback, as we walked in my youngest said dad do you like your birthday restaurant.  I laughed and said yes.  Well a waitress must of heard that and after finishing dinner the owner proudly brought over a dessert proclaimed happy bday and on the house.  Very very nice touch.

I will be back..again..and again...and again...Best Sushi I have found in the South Valley BY FAR!"}
{"text":"Location: this is a small restaurant with limited seatings. Nevertheless, it is cozy and comfortable. Definitely not for a huge party though. It doesn't take me long to figure out that this restaurant is family owned. 

Service: Our waitress was nice and attentive. She was very good at checking up on our orders and explaining the happy hour menu. On our way out, the owner behind the sushi bar smiled at us to say goodbye. I thought that was very nice. 

Food: the Arizona roll is excellent! It is spicy but yet favorable. However, the tofu appetizer is not what I expected. The sauce is great but the fried tofu is a bit chewy. The egg rolls that we ordered was just ok...Caterpillar rolls were awesome. I highly recommend it

Rating: I'll probably come back to try other roll. Overall, I think this restaurant is average."}
