{"text":"Love the selection of local beers. They don't have flights, but they let us try whatever we wanted. The sidewinder fries we delicious and super crispy. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"It just opened but you wouldn't know it, because they didn't seem to have any of the quirks. Great service.  The food was good as well. I had the \"on the green salad\" and it was a real salad. No romaine and some tomatoes for color like some sports bars (ahem zipps). The hubs had a flatbread and it was good. I can't remember the name but it had a great pesto sauce. They also had a pretty good craft beer selection.  Also had some colors light and miller for the less refined beer drinker. I'll be back for sure. Glad to see something awesome in chandler."}
{"text":"We wanted to support local and try a new place. The restaurant was not crowded, and the service was slow and lackluster. The food was mediocre... nothing crave worthy. Art on the walls indicated support of local growers, etc., which was not evident in eating the food. Bottom line: did not seem local at all."}
{"text":"Overall the atmosphere is a fun sports bar, but the menu could be improved. Everything seems phenomenal on a paper, but isn't well executed. I got the fish tacos and was surprised with the low quality ingredients that seemed thrown together. This place has a lot of potential to be a really cool spot if they could lower the noise and improve their food!"}
{"text":"We ate here our first night in Chandler, and it did not disappoint.  The atmosphere was fun and the evening was lovely, which was great to enjoy outdoor seating. We had the shrimp tacos and the Philly cheesesteak sandwich...both delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great new sports bar in the heart of downtown Chandler.  It's a great place to watch a game, and drink some local craft beers. As far as the food, I love the nachos, brats and sliders.  The sidewinder fries are definitely unique and also worth a try.  Great large patio area, and open bar  setup with seating both inside and out. I'm glad to have a new favorite hangout directly on my way home from work."}
{"text":"We came for a Sunday lunch, but left feeling \"meh\". Service was slow, they had 2 folks servicing the entire place, and the food was typical bar food. Prices were higher than a normal bar. We also watched 2 other tables walk out due to no service. I'm not sure i would come again."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place a better review. I was excited to try it and was very disappointed. But the bad service and average bar food at a premium price will make me not want to go here again."}
{"text":"This bar is so fun,  indoor and outdoor seating, fires outside, tv projection and local beers and spirits. The staff was attentive and kind and the owner was there till closing and was accommodating and showed us around! The layout is fun and inviting to all types of people, def. reccomend this place to anyone looking for a fun night out!"}
{"text":"Ive been wanting to come to this place since i found out it had opened. I finally got the chance tonight and I had a great time. The bartender Katie made sure my glass was not  empty and let me try stuff on the tap I had never tried. Her service was excellent and I will be back. See ya soon!"}
{"text":"First time here, but not so sure i would come back. I sat at the bar and the bartender was super attentive, but the food... not so good. The only thing I ordered was an appetizer plate of Chicken strips and fries. It took forever to get my food, and by the time I did, my fries were completely cold. The place has a pretty neat atmosphere but definitely not so many younger adults. Totally mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Ok, our first and last time here. We waited nearly 30 minutes just for appetizers alone, so we decided right of way not to pursue any more food.  The tacos I order just ok nothing great, Elmers down the street are much better. It is so loud in there that it is impossible to carry a conversation with out screaming (should have seated outside). Never going back!"}
{"text":"This is based on service only. When we walked up and there was a sign that said seat yourself. We sat for about 10 minutes no one greeted us so I grabbed menus so I could order by the time the waitress came... Few minutes go by and still no hello or approach from anyone. Not cool! So we left without trying the food."}
{"text":"Fun, neighborhood place i like to call my spot ... definately stop in and see Jenny... awesome bartender who really makes you feel at home! Actually ALL the employees are fantastic and welcoming . Reasonably priced compared to most places in DT Chandler and food is great!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! Oscar was our server and was so attentive and helpful. The food was awesome. They brought us free donuts when we sat down and even though it was still breakfast hours, they let us order lunch. The nachos are amazing. Definitely recommend this new spot in chandler!"}
{"text":"Surprised at how much I am diggin this spot. Dog friendly patio, great drink specials with local beers, and so far all of the food we have tried has been tasty. The servers are decent, only one has been super. And they can't seem to figure out the hostess situation. They float between seat yourself and hosting but they don't always seem to know when they want what. We've watched the server get super irked when people seat themselves when the sign says to go for it, and then managers chase after people when no hostess is in sight so people start to wander (no sign posted, but no person either)."}
{"text":"Excellent service!  She was outgoing and super attentitive!  Food was tasty but came out wrong. New place, new menu, still learning I'm sure.  It was a little loud and hard to have a conversation.  Football was on but you couldn't really hear what they were saying so its almost better to just have music.  And it was very warm inside.  Oh and the bathrooms are gorgeous!  Super cold.  I kinda wanted to hang out back there for a while to cool down :) All in all this will be a great place to go.  Awesome atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"The worst food and experience ever. The ranch and dressings were like water, the wings were flavorless, way over priced for what you get. Will never be back. Highly disappointed"}
{"text":"The only good thing on the menu were the pretzels. It was too loud to talk and it was so hard to get the staffs attention."}
{"text":"Every single thing on the menu is amazing!!! The Arizona Heat hot wings have sooo much flavor. The BBQ Brisket Smothered Fries will change your life. The Queen Creek sandwich is a total winner. And let's talk about the staff...they make you feel so special every time you're there. The Local is my new favorite place!!!"}
{"text":"The Local Chandler is a very new spot and I couldn't be more happier that I stumbled upon it. 

My family, friends and I wanted to go to The Perch for dinner and drinks and for the kids to see the birds. Upon arrival we were told that their kitchen is closed for renovation. So not wanting to go too far we walked to the Local Chandler and decided to give it a try. 

For those that don't know this location used to be Chicago 55 and really was not all that great or popular. So I was Instantly excited to see something new as this area of Chandler could use new locales. 

First I will start with the ambiance. The patio was very nice and open which I love. You can see onto the street and people walking by. There is also a back patio on which they had a private party event. So the outdoor presence is quite large. They have TVs everywhere, which is great because I have already planned on watching some NFL games here. Overall the interior, patio and decor was very swanky and appealing. 

We ordered some drinks and started looking over the menu. The food on paper all looked great. So great that I couldn't really decide what to get. We finally made some choices. The kids got grilled cheese sandwiches. We got some nachos, a sandwich and the Buffalo chicken flatbread. None were disappointed.  It was delicious. You can tell when they opened this place they invested in the chef and the food quality.  I would certainly recommended it for the food alone. 

As we were finishing our food and drinks Mike came by to check on us and make sure everything was ok. He even got us a round of drinks on the house. Later we met the other Mike. Mike and Mike are the owners and just super nice guys. 

Overall this is a great spot that I think will stay. It's great for families and for bar patrons and especially for Sunday football. It adds more options to the downtown chandler area that has been stagnant for a while. 

Keep it up The Local. You get my 5 stars."}
{"text":"\"BBQ Brisket Hash\" turned out to just be flavorless shredded beef... no jalape√±os like the menu mentioned, no flavor really at all. Service started out really spotty but turned around by the end. Food was awful. Clientele was less than desirable. Seemed like if you weren't the managers friend you didn't get service. Would've had another drink if I could've had the time of day during the meal instead of when I appeared ready for the check. Really wanted this place to be a cool spot but I wouldn't recommend it. It's so disappointing when you see a spot that has so much potential, and a staff that appears to be knowledgeable of the industry, just tank it and fail in every way possible. It's the service industry.. if mornings aren't your thing, don't work a morning shift. If your menu says brisket, serve brisket."}
{"text":"We had so much fun here donating a toy for  toys for tots.  They had a wonderful band and there was some very kind and friendly patrons at this fine establishment."}
{"text":"55 Chicago sucked.  I just don't understand taking such a great location and such a beautiful bar/restaurant and patio space and turning it into an overpriced, poorly serviced shitshow.

The Local is not 55 Chicago.  I mean sure, the inside just looks like they painted over a few of the things in there, and the decor totally doesn't match their sports bar vibe, but there are plenty of TVs so that's nice, and there's a good beer selection.

I feel like there's a disconnect between the menu and the actual food.  The B.L.A.T. mentions heirloom tomatoes, crispy bacon and avocado.  The wimpy and mealy tomato that came with it wasn't even present enough to notice if it was heirloom or not.  The 3 little wisps of avocado that came with it were kind of embarrassing.  The bacon that came with it was solid, and there was a decent enough amount I guess, though the bread was barely toasted.  A BLT on sourdough kinda needs that toasting of the bread, so this felt kinda underwhelming.  Plus the BLT at Meridiem has me spoiled.  That thing is loaded and amazing AND CHEAPER.  That's the biggest problem - this mediocre BLAT is $12.  It's two slices of bread and a quarter of an avocado and 3 strips of bacon, why the hell is it $12?  And for a $12 pricey sandwich with fancy heirloom tomatoes and herb mayo, to come served in a plastic basket seems kinda funny.  I don't mind, I mean I'm not fancy by any means, but this makes it seem like the food is high-end and then it gets schlepped to you in a cafeteria basket. 

Still, it wasn't bad.  The green chile brat also wasn't too bad - the brat itself from Von Hanson's is good, but the cactus pickle relish A) made the entire thing kind of slimy...which is not great, and B) The entire thing was covered in it, like I could barely find my actual brat because it was smothered in cactus pickle relish.  Slow down with that shit, good lord.

The happy hour prices were decent enough, the food is overpriced, the regular beer prices are kinda bad, but the building is still in a great location and luckily the staff doesn't seem snotty and exclusionary like the 55 Chicago staff was - those guys almost seemed like they were instructed to be dicks.  I don't know if this is a new staff or the same staff but they're not wieners like they used to be.

This is an improvement on 55 Chicago.  It's not perfect. The prices could be better, the decor could be warmer, the food could be executed better, but here's hoping it ends up improving and sticking around."}
{"text":"Cool new restaurant open in downtown Chandler.  Great TV's for ball games!   Nice open airy feel.  Creative food and attentive owners!  We'll be back."}
{"text":"We met for happy hour... 11am to 7pm weekdays. They had a lot of great choices and the food and drinks were great. The service was good too and the prices are in line with the neighborhood. We will definitely do it again."}
{"text":"First time back since the name change - and we love it! We had our dog with us so I wasn't sure we could get in but Mike welcomed us warmly and told us dogs are welcome on their beautiful patio. He even brought Kirby a clean bowl of ice water 

Lots of TVs to watch sports and the food was quite yummy. Great service!! Local beers - great spot - check it out!!"}
{"text":"okaaayyyy this place is legiiiitttttt. Ive been crusin over to this joint since it was like 4 other bars. The Local by far is the best no question about it. 

Want a cheap slurp? Done
Want some hunky grub? No problem
Want a cool layout to relax your legs? Grab a seat outside on the couches (it kinda reminds me of my old house where we had couches in our backyard but The Local doesn't have naked drunk guys passed out in bushes and Natural Ice beer cans scattered in the dirt)

The owners are all good dewds and the staff are all chill as hayll. 

Sometimes you can even catch a couple weirdos petting and feeding birds right behind the patio at The Perch. So if youre into that like i am....its a plus. (yes into watching weirdos pet and feed birds...dont knock it until you try it)

JUST GET THERE AND PARTY ALREADY!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The bar is very nice, service was slow. 2 different bartenders forgot my friends drink. Food was good a little pricey"}
{"text":"Wow. These folks get it, and I mean they really get it. Imagine a restaurant owner saying hello to you and your party as you walk by his restaurant to go to the restaurant down the street. Now, take one more step and imagine the restaurant down the street just literally sucking. Where would you go?  Yep. The guy that said hello. 

We are sure glad we did. Bazinga!

First, the ambiance is killer. Think upscale sports bar with without the pretentious nonsense. Add the perfect level of acknowledgment to local sports heroes. Next, put some awesome and attentive staff in place. Last, serve up some culinary sports bar wizardry. And not your basic sports bar boredom. Good stuff. Creative stuff. Different stuff. Damn delish stuff. 

Don't forget a small yet expertly selected draft beer offering. 

Yeah, this place kicks ass. Nom nom nom!"}
{"text":"What a great place! The owner stopped by our table to make certain all was well and it sure was! Beers from local breweries, a menu that highlights Arizona and Fitz, Phil, Goldie & Tillman adorn the walls of this awesome sports venue. I tried the I-17 (BBQ & Bacon burger) preceded by wings and cheese curds shared by he table. All the entrees were presented well, delivered timely and the friendly staff was always attentive to our needs. This place is running like a veteran operation after only a mere few weeks of being open for business. I would certainly recommend this to anyone looking for a fresh alternative to the stale sports bar offerings that seem to be to status quo. Well done to The Local for providing great food, great beer in an atmosphere worthy of a true Arizona sports fan. I'll be back often with friends and family."}
{"text":"Great food, great beers, great service and all the tvs you could ever need.
Easy to find a seat at 5:00pm on a Sunday night and they never let my glass get empty.
Very highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came out to watch the NFL Sunday night game since they are classified as a sports bar. Ambience is nice / open concept and lots of TV's to watch the games / however the prices are super high / not necessarily too much more expensive than a lot of other places but honestly 12.50 for 3 small BBQ sliders and $9 for a small basket of cheese curds (which were good by the way) is way too high for the quality of the food being. It also bar food. The most unfortunate part is the service - very slow and very unprofessional. All of the servers were to busy chatting it up with the bartenders and each other to pay attention to us for refills and just checking in. Will not come back based on these 2 killer points for restaurants. Sorry Local you just don't cut t."}
{"text":"I ordered wings to go, and when I got home I opened up my takeout to a flatbread. I even got every sauce I ordered with the wings, but no wings! I tried calling to see if I could order wings or get my order corrected, and there was no answer! I want either my money back or wings! This isn't right!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on Sunday and had the best experience! First of all they brought our appetizer by accident to another table because they ordered the same thing. So because it took longer they ended up comping our appetizer. (Which was amazing btw) then the waitress brought me a drink and it spilled a little (no big deal). But the manager noticed and comped that drink. They really didn't have to do that.  It was great service the manager Mike was very apologetic. The service was great!!!! Atmosphere was awesome as well! I def will go back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because I like the name and the premise but it fell short.

The Local is a sports restaurant/bar. The back wall is adorned with hundreds of baseballs and there is a game playing on every t.v. you can see. This place is perfect for someone who wants to catch a game, enjoy the nice cool outside weather that is coming in the fall and hang with their friends. They offer a few beers on tap, though the prices are a little steep but they did offer some craft beer choices.

We sat by the fireplace on the couches which was nice and my favorite part. The wait staff were all friendly, nice and attentive to our needs. Though the experience started to lose its charm when the food arrived. We ordered the pretzels appetizer which comes with their special cheese and mustard. The cheese was already hardened by the time it came to us so it was hard to dip the pretzels in to even get the cheese. My suggestion is to keep the cheese a melty consistency by using a small holder for the cheese with a tea light underneath it. It would help to keep it warm and able to eat it. The cheese was good other than that I could barely eat it. The mustard was great and had a nice bite to it. The pretzel rolls were super greasy and when I took a bite, they were still cold and partially frozen inside. This really turned me off and i couldn't even use warm cheese to warm it. My suggestion, make some pretzel rolls from scratch and avoid the greasy topping, it was too much and ruined the roll. 

For our entrees, i got the bacon jam sliders. I loved the bacon jam, it had a perfect taste and the cheese was pretty good on the sliders. My only complaint is that the garlic aioli seemed more like a heavy mayonnaise and there was too much. If I got it again, I would get it on the side. My husband got the Arizona sandwich and loved it. The plating choices were plastic containers with a tissue like paper underneath. I feel for the prices we paid we would get metal containers at least instead of plastic.

Parking is in abundance for this place, there is a dirt lot across the street which has free parking and I believe the adjacent parking lot can be used for them too. 

I know the Local has been only open for a month and still trying to find their identity but I hope they can make small changes to make this place even better. Though if your here for watching sports, you will love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great new addition to downtown Chandler! Edamame is so good! Great vibe and service. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Have had a few people recommend the food at The Local Chandler when they hear I live in Chandler. Had always thought it was a joke. Finally, I decided to give it a try and was not disappointed.
My server suggested the shrimp tacos when trying to decide and my choice happened to be an item for another time of day.
The food was wonderful and the server was great. 
Not sure about the Trivia game going on at the time, but it was not over amplified like many restaurant entertainment tend to be. That was definitely the hit for the rest of the patrons there.
Overall, was a great venue to relax at the end of the day and have great tasting food and great service."}
{"text":"Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys watching sports and having a yummy drink! The service is great as well as the overall environment. Amazing chicken pesto sliders and orange blossom beer"}
{"text":"I only ordered a beer, but was a nice, clean local brewery with a good variety of craft beers. If you are into local beers and you're in the area its a good bet."}
{"text":"Tried this place a few weeks ago with a friend. The food was decent and so were the drinks, however the service was terrible and we were ignored most of the time, occasionally being checked on by an uninterested and annoyed waiter. After awhile we ended up being pushed out almost literally by a pub crawl group. I thought the bad service was an isolated incident....

My boyfriend and I decided to grab some dinner here tonight because I told him the food was good and I'd like to try more of the menu, so we went and sat on the patio. It was dead in there so I know multiple people saw us walk in. We sat on the patio for about 15 minutes without a soul coming by with a menu or even a 'hello'. Seems they were more concerned setting up their 'trivia' night. After being ignored for so long  we got up and went next door to The Perch and enjoyed our night with great service and food. Not sure if I even want to bother coming back to try this place again unfortunately."}
{"text":"We have been here 5 times now since it opened and I cannot say enough about how awesome this place is. The food is amazing. The jalape√±o cheddar brat is one of the best meals I've ever had at a bar. The whole menu is really authentic and enticing. Not your typical bar menu which we love. Its great that there are a few different options in terms of seating. The patio space is perfect. The owners are very friendly and the service has been spot in every time. So glad to have this new favorite spot in town!"}
{"text":"Last minute pop in to finish watching a NFL game. We were starving! Ordered the spinach dip which was perfect, it has green chili's in it and was really flavorful. We also ordered the teriyaki edamame and that was bursting with flavor, so delicious. The table ordered chicken fingers, bacon jam sliders, wedge salad, and those puffy pretzel balls with beer cheese. Everything was really good! Happy to have stumbled in on this spot and will be back when we're craving good bar food. Of course it's a little loud on a Sunday but why wouldn't it be? It's football Sunday Funday! Love that the wine and beer are from LOCAL businesses."}
{"text":"I love the idea of having a new sports bar in town selling local items. So we went right away! It is nice and the food was good. If you are going to sit there for awhile though and watch a sport event... they need to offer drink specials. It was pricey and we could not stay the whole game since the drinks were expensive. Service was good."}
{"text":"Loved the appetizers, burgers, and locally named drinks. Great menu and great atmosphere. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"i'm here right now enjoying great cocktails and listening to some great music by Trey Odum playing some awesome throwbacks on his acoustic guitar. The environment is super friendly and inviting and we got awesome service by our waitress Ryan. It's my Second time here and i'm very pleased with the place i will be coming back more often"}
{"text":"Too. Expensive. Too. Expensive. Repeat. 

Why is it that in every major city, there exists, in abundance, a venue nearly identical to Local, with reasonably priced bar food? A $9 burger costs $14.50 here. A $6 plate of chicken tenders costs $9 here. Check the menu, it goes on and on. After seeing these absurdly inflated prices for bar faire, it becomes painfully obvious that ownership is incredibly out of touch with its proper positioning in the relative restaurant demographic, and using high prices to \"force\" a higher-scale vibe onto its customers, even despite its incredibly normal theme. Go to Seattle, Denver, San Diego, Salt Lake, Vegas, Austin or any other trendy modern city, and places like Local are commonplace (and priced appropriately)."}
{"text":"5 stars for being an amazing place and for being the only place open on Christmas. The food we had was delicious (Range Balls aka the pretzel balls and Sidewinder fries). The selection of craft beers is amazing, even if they were out of Popcycle brew (my new favorite). Even though they were packed and not staffed for an almost full house, the service was great and everyone was incredibly friendly. Can't wait to drop by again!"}
{"text":"So much fun!!! What a great place to have drinks and enjoy some live music! The Local has everything I love... AWESOME patio, good drinks and great service! It's a fantastic addition to all the great spots in the downtown Chandler area.

Our group of about 20 arrived around 8:30 on a Saturday night and was taken care of by Emily who did a fantastic job! We went after dinner down the street so I didn't look at the menu but another couple who met us there had a hamburger and said it was really good. 

The only downside is the bathroom situation. There are 3 M/W stalls that just don't work well when it's busy and people have had a few drinks... Let's just say that I'm all for bathroom equality but I think everyone can agree there should be urinals for those who chose to stand..."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday to grab a bite to eat & our food was awesome.  The service was also very good.  Can't wait to go back to enjoy the great patio they have!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised to find a spot with such a cool vibe right in downtown Chandler!  The service was fantastic.  The local brews were really good.  Make sure to try their sidewinder fries.  Yum!  Nothing bad to say about this place.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"YOU WILL LOVE THIS PLACE!! GREAT flavorful food! Hot crispy wings! Excellent service from Oscar and Manager!!! Our new hot spot for watching ASU football!"}
{"text":"Love this little place. So much character. Outside seating, variety of beers & drinks, tasty food!"}
{"text":"Great new place in downtown Chandler! Today was my third time in because the food is so good and a great indoor/outdoor set up. Everything I've tried so far has amazing and a cherry on top is they have the BEST ranch (I'm a total ranch connoisseur).  Service has been fantastic, I'd say it's a smooth running machine for only being open a few weeks. I see a lot of football games being watched here with all the TV's, indoor-outdoor feel, delicious food and great service."}
{"text":"We went here on Saint Patrick's day evening. They were really busy which may be the reason that our  experience was so poor.  We ordered drinks and appetizers. After about 15 minutes, the waitress came back and took our order for main courses.  Well, we got our main courses but never received our appetizers. We asked the waitress and she said she would take it off our bill and ran off.  This place used to be Chicago 55 which also had horrible service.   Seems like nothing has changed.  As for the food we did get- sliders were good,  burger average at best, cheese steak lousy.  Doubt we will be back until it is taken over by something better"}
{"text":"Awful food and service, would say on par or below a 3 AM outing to Denny's. Also I was charged full price for my food (chicken tenders) that was on the happy hour menu. Don't go here, there are far better bars in the area. There was clearly a reason why nobody was in the restaurant, we should have taken the hint."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous lunch at The Local.  Great food, great beer, great atmosphere.  And the server, who was at table when we were there remembered me from a previous visit and that i had a gift card.  Not the usual bar fare, the food is unique and excellant."}
{"text":"Stopped into this place for a bit to check it out and have a drink,  but its hard to give it 5 stars because of how much in Chandler is surrounding it, the competition is fierce!

The bartenders are personable, the food is pretty basic bar food, the sports bar vibe is chill, some good TVs and whatnot.

Enjoyable and cool, but sadly I would pick elsewhere in Downtown Chandler for a solid flavorful meal, atmosphere and experience.

The fireplaces are great for at night sit downs if you are into doing that for the night, everything else is pretty standard"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Atmosphere is great, tvs, good music and vibe. Decor is sports themed, az themed sports dudes, garage doors open out to cool patio. Love the reclaimed wood! Good beer selection, service and food. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Saw it was open and decided to try it.  The establishment itself is a great design. The service was great. The food not so much and it's all about portions vs. price. We ordered the blackened chicken nachos; The nachos were very tasty but for 14 dollars, it's seriously lacking quantity. The basket they came in had sides on it that were about an inch or so high. The nachos barely reached the height of the basket side. For 14 bucks, we were kind of expecting the pile to well over the 4 to 5 inches high. I ordered the I-17 burger with fries. The burger was decent but again, for 14 bucks the other half of the basket should have been overflowing with fries. Barely a handful of fries. Now for the beer and I had this same complaint when it was Chicago 55. What ever cooler the bottle beer is stored in is NOT cold enough. I would guess my Miller Lite was served at about 45 degrees. The bottle did not even \"sweat\" while sitting in 80 degrees.  Please fix that and the portions and I'll definitely come back and recommend it."}
{"text":"Trivia night!  Ashley and I had a lot of fun, but we didn't even Place...we needed Steff, she's the trivia queen!  When she gets down here we'll take our  rightful throne!!  I had the Click Norris flatbread, spicy!  But not overly spicy, very well done!
If, you're looking for a few hours of entertainment without breaking the bank trivia night is made for you!  Come before 7:00 and enjoy some happy hour special drinks and food, then stay for trivia( starts at 7:00) You'll be home by 9:00 and maybe you'll win some $$ coupons for a future night out.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"Went last night for St Patricks day and my friends bachelor party to eat some food to enable us to continue on for the night. The place had some really good live music and a good vibe about it. Service was good considering it was slammed with the larger than normal crowd. A couple of my friends got sandwiches and burgers, I got the BBQ beef brisket fries and they were awesome, I loved the fries and their very strange but delicious cut. Good beer selection, love me some Dragoon IPA from Tucson. Definitely a good amount of TVs, we enjoyed watching some of the March Madness while we ate and drank. Would definitely go back, maybe during a more peaceful time than a busy drinking holiday haha."}
{"text":"Gosh, can't believe I've never commented on San Tan.  Love this place. Usually sit at the bar cause it's more social.  Great food, great selection of specialty and regular craft beers. Bar staff introduces themselves to you and have ever since we've been coming here .. provably 8 or 9 yrs.  We live in south Phoenix so it's a trek but we'll worth it."}
{"text":"Breakfast Heaven found in Chandler!!!!!!! 
Check the picture...best Donuts holes EVER...EVER... and then put your 2 favorite beverages together and there you have it....coffee and beer....As Vince puts it CULINARY ORGASM!!!!! Huss Brewing co. Koffee Kolsch! Breakfast built for champions!!! 
This place is great... friends, family to meet up. They have sound for football games, great and friendly conversations and tasty food!! Try the Pretzel Balls with the devil's ale cheese sauce..or how about the green chili cactus dip or the charred edamame... You can NOT go wrong!!!"}
{"text":"We attempted to eat here twice and only made it through once- solely due to the ridiculous noise level.   TV at full volume on the speakers, plus a restaurant full of people competing to be heard over it and each other....Ouch.  We couldn't have a conversation even sitting next to each other at the bar. 
Food is pretty good-interesting menu.  We really liked the spicy edamame. Atmosphere is a little weird-Like an upscale fresh food restaurant tried to turn into a sports bar.   
We probably won't go back. And if we do, we'll bring ear plugs."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a cool new sports bar this is the place! Very nice atmosphere and was not super busy. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive. I had just their basic cheeseburger, so it wasn't anything fantastic, but the other food my family ordered all looked great. My parents came here a few nights ago and loved it so much they chose this as the family night dinner location so we could try it as well. My mom loves the nachos and my husband tried them as well and said they were better than his burger."}
{"text":"Great NEW spot in downtown Chandler! Lots of TV's for football season and good food!!!"}
{"text":"Great little find in Downtown Chandler! The patio is so welcoming for casual get togethers and the inside has larger tables for more formal seating. There are TVs throughout the entire place but the volume was not overwhelming. The staff was incredible, the manager, bartender and waitress were all more than accommodating and very friendly! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in recently to try this local place. The server was very friendly and the atmosphere was nice. Several television screens to watch various games. But walk to the back toward the bathrooms - the sink is very cool and is in front of an outdoor patio that opens up into an area next to the Perch. A large brick wall has a projected television screen. So cool!

We ordered a pound of wings (about 10 for $12.50) and chicken nachos ($13.50). The sauce on the nachos was slightly spicy and they were stacked. In fact I couldn't even eat all of it. They have good prices on local beer, and on the weekends there is usually live music after 9pm. I will definitely check them out again!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice now, and love it! We live right by downtown Chandler, and weren't crazy about Chicago 55, so we were very excited to try it when we saw it was something different. 

The first time we went and tried a couple of different cocktails - I had the Sir Charles Strawberry slammer and loved it! Very easy to drink bourbon cocktail. My fianc√© got the Sleepy Floyd's cinnamon fire and my mom got the Chapman Cilantro jalape√±o, I tried them both and they were both delicious! We shared an appetizer (the BBQ brisket smothered fries) and they were amazing too!

My fianc√© and I went back last week for dinner and liked it a lot again. We both got sandwiches, and had a couple of beers. I love that they have all local brews on the menu, and have a pretty big variety on draft!

Every time we've been there the service is great and everyone is super friendly. Very quick and accommodating. Several steps up from when it was Chicago 55, and since we live so close, this is probably going to be one of our regular go tos!"}
{"text":"We love the spinach, green Chile dip here! Such a cute little spot, with the cute outdoor fireplace area (not that it's needed in the summers here), the food is good and the beers are great and reasonable. I've also tried the short rib chili, so good!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite place for bugers and drinks!  Their food and beverage is all locally grown and brewed.  The service is great and they have plenty of tv's to watch all the games.   Nice ambiance as well and great patio.   We'll be back"}
{"text":"This is my husband and I's go-to place for a casual place to have brunch or dinner. We just moved to the area right after it opened. They are always quick to serve, accommodate us having our dog after a long hike, and have some great local beer selections. The food is quality for your local tap house and they have tons of screens to watch all of your sporting events. Get the pretzel balls for an app! This really is a great, quality bar!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Great food! Great Drinks! Great place to watch the game!

We were planning to go to the perch, but fortunately for us, the perch's kitchen is still undergoing renovation, so we happened to discover this place next door! It's only been open for 9 days but the place was hopping. They have a large patio that encompasses the perimeter of the indoor seating. On one side of the patio there was a birthday party going on. We sat in the patio the other side. The decor was pretty inviting with flaming lanterns and hanging string lights. Also, another thing to note, is no matter what angle, there was a tv within my sight.

We started with a dragoon IPA, which is pretty good beer from Tucson. We ordered the blackened chicken nachos, the Arizona Ave sandwich, the clubhouse sandwich, the cluck Norris flatbread, and some grilled cheese for the kiddos. 

I'd recommend the chicken nachos. They were so good! A little on the spicy side and really crispy chips. I'd also definitely recommend the Arizona Ave sandwich. Though a bit messy, the flavors really come together in this great sandwich. I got asparagus as my side, and they were cooked perfectly as well. 

Our server was Skyler and she took care of us, and checked on us often, which I always appreciate. The owners, Mike and Mike stopped by every table checking up how everyone was doing. Really nice, funny guys wanting to open up a nice place where you can go to watch the game. Great place!

We plan to come back to try the wings!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both times have been spectacular! The first was for drinks and live music, the second for dinner. The service has been great both times, prices are reasonable, the food tastes delicious, and the drinks are local. What more can you ask for?! If you're looking for a chill, upscale place to take a date or hang out with your friends, this is the place!"}
{"text":"I love this place great beer selection, good food, and great staff! They have a good happy hour too 11-7 ! It's hard to find places that have happy hour that's later than 6pm! Oh and it's a dog friendly bar which makes it even better"}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was awesome! Justin was very attentive. We started with happy hour which was okay but the \"chandler cheese steak\" was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch today and ordered the On the Green Salad.  It was beyond delicious and the service was amazing!  Great addition to downtown Chandler!"}
{"text":"I met a friend at this relatively newer addition to downtown Chandler. And had a very enjoyable evening.

It is my understanding it's the only sports bar in downtown Chandler, at least that's what one of the owners, Mike, told me. In fact both of the owners name is Mike. The Mike I spoke to was very friendly and extremely engaged to all of the needs of the customers. You could see he was extremely proud of the business they had started. And the fact that they had a very active client base is a good sign of future success.

They have a good selection of beer and wine and a pretty normal bar food selection. Service was extremely good. They had a band, which I found out was led by a local radio DJ, Rich Berra. My understanding is he is going to be a somewhat regular at the bar.

It is a sports bar so there are lots of TVs and it's easy to watch from pretty much any location.

If you live in the Chandler area and you like sports you should check this place out."}
{"text":"Very good sports bar, a lot of tv's atmosphere is great, drinks are also amazing.  Food is good as well they have craps on Monday for those that want to learn how to play."}
{"text":"Great food... Awesome atmosphere... Cold beer... And the patio is dog friendly 

Will totally be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's our favorite place now. Reminds us of Zipps because of the atmosphere, prices, and the people who work there. They are cool, laid back, and super nice and they care. The bar and kitchen are open later then the other bars. If they had some games to play (shuffle board, golden tee games ) then it would be even better. Love the fireplace and the whole set up. Can't wait to get back."}
{"text":"New spot that used to be Chicago 55. It didnt last as that and it won't last as this either with the prices.

$6.50 for a 22oz Coors Light!?!! How about you suck it!!

Didn't try the food. The people were all pretty cool. It's basically the managers that used to manage Bourbon Jacks. Which was a great place because they had great deals on beers.

We hit it for Saturday football and 8 beers later we had a $60 tab. Meh...maybe try it for happy hour if they have any deals.

Call ahead and ask for pricing and see for yourself. They def need to work on that."}
{"text":"The Local is so such an awesome place to have so close by! The food is all delicious, the staff is great, and the outdoor patio area is a fantastic use of space. I am lucky enough to enjoy food from the local a few times a month and I'm always pleasantly surprised. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"A word of advice when eating at this place just avoid anything that isn't incredibly simple bar food like wings or fries and you won't be disappointed. The wings are fantastic. Everything else we ordered was horribly bland and despite being very hungry neither me or my boyfriend could stomach our orders and were not offered anything else when we made it clear we weren't going to be able to eat it. The atmosphere is great and cozy and fun but when I spent $50 for a meal and only ate a few wings and fries I'm leaving pretty pissed off."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place out.  Loved our table on the patio with the heater, good views of TV and good people watching.  Unfortunately, that's where the good stopped.  Ordered a wedge salad and filet strips (medium) and the AZ Ave sandwich.  Got the sandwich and fries ok, the wedge was missing the filet.  The runner dropped it so fast I had to call after him to let him know the filet was missing.  Then after five minutes, the server came to ask how everything was and we told her the filet was missing from the salad and she said she'd go get it.  Another 10 min later I was delivered a tiny bowl of well done \"steak\" bites, fresh from the Applebee's menu.  I was starving, so I started to cut my wedge, but my butter knife wasn't quite sharp enough to saw through the massive amount of lettuce rind that was supposed to be my wedge salad.  As far as my streak bites, tough isn't strong enough a word to describe. All in all, very disappointed.  Server was totally disinterested in us after the salad snafu.  Won't return.  Bummer."}
{"text":"Great Food, Nice place. Have tried the 3 Taco verities as well as the Chuck Norris Flatbread.
All great!"}
{"text":"Food was good service great lots of tv's  on Sunday's all the football  you could ever want"}
{"text":"Great spot downtown! Lots of draft selection & really good food. Server was fast and friendly. Plenty of tvs for all sports games. Outside bar looks awesome. New favorite!"}
{"text":"My first time at The Local. Great place to meet friends ....good food...staff very friendly...nice music...
I will make it a regular place to visit"}
{"text":"Great food, great selection of beers, and wonderful friendly staff. If you're sick of humdrum menus then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Just had the 87 burger with sidewinder fries. So good!  Jenny and Geneva are being very attentive, and a pleasure to talk to while I'm watching the game at the bar. This place has good energy. Jacob is a great guy behind the bar, and along with the entire staff, making me feel welcome. This is a must try. I recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Recently attended a wedding reception at this venue.  I was one of the two people who volunteered to set up.  I cannot say enough about the owners and their staff. They were so helpful, super friendly, just an all around good group.  You can tell that the owners appreciate their employees and it really reflects in the service.  This alone gives them 5 stars.  I was lucky enough to munch on the Range Balls, OMG...that cheese sauce, the Green Chili Cactus Spinach Dip, yes please, incredible creamy, and the Bacon Jam Sliders, I need that in a full size burger.  If the rest of their menu compares to this buffet offering you MUST give them a try.  Plus, support a local business that really cares about the customer and the employees and does a damn good job!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and to work a little bit. Wi-Fi and a cold beer is what I was looking for and I got that and more. Decided to grab some lunch as well and had the Asian tacos of the lunch menu. $8.99 for two tacos, side salad. Very good, fresh lettuce in the salad and the tacos were on point. $3 pint and I was good to go. Plenty of TVs for sports viewing and a nice outdoor vibe. 

I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Dropped in after seeing the changes at the location and will be going back.

Atmosphere - We sat inside because it was a cold day but the patio looks great. Inside is open a comfortable, a combination of high tops and tables. Lots of TV's so they live up to the Sports Bar billing. The music is at an appropriate level and not blaring like other sports bars.

Service - Good enough. A few gaps in service timing but the waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu and willing to give good feedback on food or beer questions.

Food/Beverages - Good enough beer taps. The mimosa was one of the best we've had wile out in any restaurant. Bacon Jam Sliders - Great. Decent size slider handmade patty of beef cooked to a perfect medium, when most others will overcook the small patty. The bacon jam gives some sweet and salty, a great touch. The onions are crispy and light. The 87 - The good size patty was cooked to my request at medium rare, lots of flavor and juicy. I didn't notice the pepper jack cheese as much as the jalapenos. Good head but not too much. The chipotle aioli gave it a lot of flavor.

I'm going with 5 stars because it exceeded my expectations. The atmosphere is great and the food is well above the normal bar food. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"We wanted to try somewhere new, so glad we did. The Local is a perfect mix of sports atmosphere and night life. They have a large inviting patio in the back, very comfortable. A live band began to play after the game, best of both worlds! Our server was very attentive and the food was spot on. The manager visited our table and gave us a little background on the place. Proud to say they do their best to keep everything local. Would like to call this our new spot!"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night and the place didn't even have enough water cups and only filled ours halfway full (we also didn't have napkins the entire time). The service was alright but it didn't  make up for the food...the only food that we liked was their sidewinder fries and the beer. Other than that, our group of friends were all in agreement to not come back. We went to San Tan Brewery afterwards."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service at very reasonable prices. All local brews and food. I Had a surprise party here on Saturday afternoon 03-10-18 for a family member. Mike Smith and the entire staff at The Local couldn't have been more helpful and accommodating. Weather turned and it started raining. I had planned for an outdoor patio party. When the rain started (minutes before the surprise) Mike and his staff turned it into an indoor fireplace party in a snap without a single hesitation! Awesome job, I definitely couldn't have pulled it off without The Locals help. Thank you, thank you!!!"}
{"text":"6 of us stopped in on Friday night to listen to Tres Hombres.  
   The parking lot right across the street is huge, so no worries about finding a space at all.
  There is ample seating, enough that we all got to sit together right near the band. The bar looked clean and there are tons of tv screens to watch the games from anywhere you sit.
    I love that the patio is dog friendly!
  The drinks actually had some alcohol in them, which is a rarity nowadays.  They were made perfectly and we kept them coming!
   Our server was attentive and made sure we all had anything we needed at all times. Since we had just come from dinner we only ordered the fries, but they were crispy, salty and just what we wanted.
   Great location and a great place to relax, grab a drink, watch your favorite game, listen to a great band and hang out with your bestest friend (aka your dog)"}
