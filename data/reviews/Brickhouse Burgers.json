{"text":"Gourmet burger at a reasonable price. Wide selection of toppings. I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Super greasy and very thin burgers. The fries are terrible - always overcooked. Tried it twice to give them a second chance but just as bad the second time around. And very expensive as well - Flip Side is cheaper! won't ever go back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place twice before giving a review. Great little burger joint with lot of options to top your burger. Onion rings are breaded (not battered) and and stay that way on the drive home. I also tried the fish sandwich and it was perfectly cooked, which ended up being my favorite (even over the burger). Trust me you have to give them a try!!"}
{"text":"Suprisingly very good!  Burgers cooked to order, fries fresh cut and tasty, very nice people.  And the price is extremely competitive for the gourmet burgers!  $6.49 Compared to Flipside for takeout, this place is a sure bet."}
{"text":"The food was decent but the wait was horrible and we  where the only ones in there messed up are order and the lady was screaming at her son the whole time in the kitchen"}
{"text":"Food wasn't horrible, I may have caught them on a good day!  Anyway, one star because they actually charge $.50 per order if you use a credit/debit card.  That's not a good touch in my opinion..."}
{"text":"Great burgers at a great price!  The basil mayo is awesome. My whole family loves this place. Didn't know they closed at 8, showed up at 755 and ordered 6 burgers and got service with a smile."}
{"text":"Fries are not good, so soggy and oily. I came here a few months after they opened and ordered chicken soup in the winter, they knew the chicken soup was cold and still served it. The soup tasted terrible and looked like somebody took all the noodles and veggies out, probably got served soup from a supposedly empty pot. I herd the employee tell the female boss, \"the soup is cold\" but she told him to serve it knowing i'd take it to go.   What a Disappointment, I really hope they fix their business because i want our town to do well. I will revisit and update my review if things improve."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review because I've been back to Brickhouse multiple times and they've really improved. I'm happy that they've turned things around...and I recommend that other Yelpers give them another go. I'm glad I did...on those couple nights a month that  I'm just not up to cooking dinner, I can swing by Brickhouse on my way home from work...convenient, consistent and I love supporting local businesses."}
{"text":"Same as last visit.  Fries are great.  Burgers are good, but a little thin and greasy.  But as far as a fast(ish) food burger joint goes, this place is pretty good.  Still no soda fountain though.  I hate buying cans and wish they would fix this!"}
{"text":"Always great burgers and fresh cut fries.  These other people bitching about burnt fries must have expected McDonalds fries.  I've never noticed the 50 cent charge for credit card payment but Jesus...it's 50 cents!?!?  Clearly if that's enough for you to leave a bad review, you're petty and soulless.  We've never had anything but great service and food here.  The guys behind the counter are always friendly and clearly know how to make a burger...you know, the real kind like they used to be before all the chains ruined the American palate.  It's a burger--it's supposed to have some juice!  Give them a shot, ignore these other fools, and find out for yourself."}
{"text":"Been here several times at different times of the day and with different people working and very surprised to see anything but all 5 star ratings. My wife and I absolutely love this place. Burgers are fresh as are the buns. My wife loves their fries and I get as excited as an 8 year old on Christmas morning when I get to have one of their malts. Very friendly staff that act genuinely appreciative you came and always thank you on your way out. I only live a few miles from here so I hope they stay there for many years to come."}
{"text":"Great food.  The burgers and chicken were cooked perfectly and the onion rings are amazing.  The place was clean and the owner and workers were very friendly.  My son loves the shakes!  I think the prices are fair considering everything is cooked to order and the bread and topping choices are many.  I have been there 3 times and have always had a great experience and great food!  I will definitely go back again and again.  In fact - for dinner tonight!  A medium salad with chicken, sunflower seeds, cheese and balsamic dressing!  Yum!"}
{"text":"No stars! This place is horrible. My mom ordered the black bean burger (she's vegetarian) they gave her a beef patty, only she didn't realize until after she bit into it. Their response? \" our bad\"  Our bad?? That's a serious issue!! Went another time and waited over 45 min for our burgers, one which needed a gluten free bun, I heard them trying to pass off a regular bun as gluten free!! Not acceptable! Finally got home with our food and our whole order was wrong! Never again!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on line. Sounded great to try.  Super hard to find as it's on the side of a strip mall off a busy street.  Simple menu made it easy to make your selections.  Foods rating: 2.75 burger was good but not great. Toppings were plentiful and fresh. Fries sucked.  They were over cooked, hard and therefore tasteless.   Milkshakes were simple, made with real ice cream and quite yummy.   Service: 3.0 adequate service made simple.   Appearance: 2.75. Floors were clean, but bathroom were a miss. Tables were not wiped up. But overall appearance was just ok.  Brick accents were a nice touch.   Pissed of at the extra charge for using a credit card.   They added this fee without notification to each order not just the total order.   This is kind of sleazy."}
{"text":"\"Flavor town, USA. Population me & this burger \" quote from my son! Great burgers & excellent service!"}
