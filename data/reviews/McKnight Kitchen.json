{"text":"We have eaten here a few times and have been pleased every time. The Panang is very good, spicy and well-flavored, with a decent amount of vegetables. The spring rolls are crisp and flavorful. The Pad Thai is also good.

The service has been quick and friendly.

They have also added badly needed signage outside that shows this is a sushi, pho and Thai restaurant. With a name like McKnight Kitchen, most people would not expect this type of cuisine."}
{"text":"We ordered sushi, spicy ramen, Tom yum and pho. The food here is really good, especially the pho. It's probably the best in town, at least in the north of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Sushi, Pho, thai... all amazing.  Great food, friendly and clean environment!"}
{"text":"I had pho before but here different. I ordered fresh roll  was so dry and hard to bite looks like its pre make . The soup taste not like pho so salty and blended. The service was so slow its took forever to get food . the pho  at ross park mall  taste  way  better  boba tea bar  
Do not waste your time there 
Will not be back again"}
{"text":"The food was delicious & nicely presented. The service was outstanding! A new gem in the North Hills."}
{"text":"I gotta admit, I was really looking forward to this place?

Now, we came during an off hour, so service was actually great? Our main courses did take awhile though.

Now, I had ordered the eggplant tempura, which was only 5 pieces for a hefty price, I didn't really think it was worth it. The trend continued with the miso udon, $13 for literally two cups of soup, barely any vegetables. I felt pretty skimped on it to be honest. 

It was delicious, yes, but the miso udon definitely was lacking, more of a filler I guess.

I also ordered the volcano roll, which was a bit heavy in mayonnaise. I was happy that the fish on top was toasted and warm, but the roll underneath was ice cold and pretty flavorless, so it made a contrast between the topping and bottom that didn't quite work. Perhaps baking the California roll underneath along and using more crab salad with help?

I'll probably be back at some point, but not very frequently due to high prices for smaller portions. I could easily go to sushi tomo for less expensive and more flavorful dishes. 

A huge plus to this place is the consistent addition of new dishes, it definitely maintains a customer base and keeps it interesting."}
{"text":"Enjoyed it! Good food and service. Had \"Japanese Bagel\" sushi roll and Tom Kha soup. They were both well done. Will come back! Convenient location on McKnight Road."}
{"text":"This place is a great and unique addition to the McKnight Road area.  They have a large menu full of popular Asian dishes like sushi, curry, pho, etc. at reasonable prices.  I went for dinner on a Monday night; the restaurant was fairly empty when I arrived, but seemed to pick up towards the end of my meal.

I had the Pho #1 Rare Eye Round ($10) and wasn't very impressed.  While the beef and noodles were delicious, the broth itself was lacking.  When the pho arrived, I could smell the delicious flavors associated with pho like star anise and clove.  However, I was unable to taste any of those flavors.  I also had the Tom Kha soup with tofu ($5), and it was honestly some of the best Tom Kha I've ever had!  It was super flavorful and packed with delicious veggies and well-prepared tofu.  I would go back for this soup alone!

The decor is nice and modern with ample seating options, and the restaurant itself is very clean.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Overall, a really great experience!"}
{"text":"On a recent rainy Sunday, we popped in to this place for a late lunch.  We were all in the mood for something warm and soothing...why not Pho?!?!?

The lean beef Pho was tasty and hearty, with a light broth.  The dish came with a fried spring roll and a nice side salad (with traditional dressing) that was tangy and bright.  We also shared a crab Rangoon appetizer.  They were small and served with the same dipping sauce (sweet chili) as the spring rolls.

Pleasant and attentive servers, along with a steaming bowl of soup made for a very comforting meal."}
{"text":"Service is always slow, been here several times since it's opened, there's always something wrong with the food. The pho soup is never consistent, most of the time it's too greasy. This time my pho came out 10-15 minuets after the others' are here, and it only came out after we asked for it--it took another 5 minuets for the sides for pho to come, again, after inquiring. I had returned the dish untouched in the end--- we'll never come back again for sure. Btw, when the check came, the returned pho is still on the check and we had to ask the server to remove it."}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout from here twice so far and hands-down it is the best Thai place we have seen in the North Hills in awhile (I was a huge Green Mango fan before they closed in regent square) I tried both the Red curry and pad kee mao dishes, both were great!  Reason I gave 4 star is because I was not a fan of the bang bang shrimp (lacked flavor) and I also tasted a Vietnamese noodle bowl, bowl was good and cooked well however I did not care for their fish sauce.  I'm looking forward to trying their sushi and other dishes - but so far in comparison to the other Thai places in the area (besides Nicky's which is a little from me) this gets my vote!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge lover of vietnamese, thai and sushi so I was really excited to see this place open up. I've been here a few times now,  and most recently tried a lunch box. I was blown away by the sushi. The pieces of fish were huge and  really fresh. Will definitely continue returning"}
{"text":"We got takeout and it was ready quickly. The food was good, but we thought it was way overpriced. Our calamari appetizer was about a dozen pieces for $9, it cost $2 to replace white rice with brown rice in an entree, and chicken teriyaki with noodles was $16. The portion sizes were not massive, so it just seemed like a bit too pricey for takeout meals. Probably will not go back at those prices with other favorites in the area for Thai, Chinese, and sushi."}
{"text":"Finally a good sushi place close to home. Ordered the double rainbow roll and it was fantastic. Well proportioned and presented. Also had the pad Thai and the coconut soup. Both well flavored but the soup could have been thicker. The staff were very friendly and the space was very clean. Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time the other night. Very fresh sushi and the nigiri portions are generous.   

I look forward to returning for lunch sometime, as the noodle menu looks good."}
{"text":"Good quality. Good prices. Highly versatile Asian cuisine serving multiple ethnic including chinese,  thai,  sushi, and vietnamese.  Service is really good. Portions are good size. Try this place and try Red Orchid nearby. One of those will be your go to for this type of ethnic cuisine."}
{"text":"Just found this place looking for Pho and after trying a bunch of dishes it ended up becoming one of our favorite spots!"}
{"text":"You would never know it based on the name or the storefront but this new restaurant along McKnight Roads bustling corridor is serving up some really decent Vietnamese, Japanese, Thai, and Sushi food for lunch and dinner. 

Lunch prices are lower for some items and the portions are nice. I tried the rare eye of round Pho which came with the traditional fixings of bean sprouts, Thai basil leaves, and fresh jalapeño slices. The broth was delicious although I tend to like a little more star of anise flavor. The beef was sliced nice and thin and cooked in the warm broth. For lunch, you get a small ginger salad which had dressing that tasted freshly made and a small perfectly crisp spring roll.

The service was excellent and friendly and the business really picked up over the hour we were there.  The dining area and bathrooms were immaculately clean. 

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from this place last night. 
THE PROS:
-I was so sad when I couldn't find a place that would deliver me Vietnamese food where I was, but alas! This place saved the day!
- their summer rolls are big, substantially sized logs. Delicious and fresh!
-the dat biet pho is a mix of the different pho meats, like a combo special. It had yummy tripe, meat balls, eye round, and other beef. 
-I loved how they packaged their pho to go, since they didn't want it to get soggy on the way. 
- since they forgot to include my order of pad see ew, they did call me and tell me they would refund me for it, but with the steep delivery fee-- was it worth it?

THE CONS:
-they forgot to include my order of pad see ew!
-the broth of the pho was just alright 
-lots of packaging trash. Wish there was a way to be greener about it. 
-high delivery fee."}
{"text":"2nd time here. They never are too crowded. Food is tasty but nothing special. Tonight we waited 40 minutes for 3 entrees. Almost got up and left because of the wait. Only 1 waitress for entire store. Only part of our dinner came out. Decided some was better than none. Had to stalk the waitress for our bill so we could leave!  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Heyyyyy, so I used to pass by this place with an intent to go in for quite some time now, so today I had to change all of that.  I usually just go and grab subway when I made shopping trips out here to Mcknight Road, but today I was in the mood for some stir fry.  Ofcourse, a lot of the places on McKnight Road are Sushi places and I guess this one is both Sushi and Thai food.  I got the Hawaiian noodle dish.  It tastes quite a bit like Mei Fun and yet they have Thai style noodles in there with pineapple and some veggies.  You may choose your own meat and I got tofu.  Ahhh, I ordered the Vietnamese coffee and it came with the tiny metal pot on top of the glass.  It is an interesting way to serve the coffee, but I didn't like the coffee.  They offer condensed milk and half and half.  I kind of wish they had soy milk, or almond milk.  Anyways, the dish was really quite good.  It was well cooked, spiced and it came out in a timely manner.  The wait staff was nice and helpful.  There was also a nice old man with a nice smile and that always helps.  The restaraunt is clean and modern looking.  There was not many people in the place when I was there.  I enjoyed it and I would certainly come back if I find myself on McKnight Road and hungry after shopping.
  The one thing about this place that sucks is I think the name.  It's so bland, which is not like their food.  They need a creative name that tells us about their food.  The price point is really nice and especially for what you get.  My food came with a small salad and a spring roll.  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"They have potential. 
I went on opening day for a late afternoon lunch since we saw that they opened. My husband originally ordered a Green Dragon roll and Som Tum and sticky rice (which apparently also comes with chicken). I ordered Vietnamese Spring rolls and Pho Dac Biet.
So, we were notified they did not have the ingredients for papaya salad so my husband had to order a new dish, which he the chicken vermicelli bowl. We were a bit upset for opening day that they didn't have ingredients for a fairly simple dish. 
My husband said his sushi however was great and he will definitely come back for sushi.
When my spring rolls came out, they were the wrong ones. I was handed fried Thai ones. So I notified the server and I was brought out a different set of spring rolls, which was still not fresh Vietnamese ones as described in but some other fried ones. I didn't bother bringing it up at this point because I didn't want to get another wrong order.

Meals:
My pho came extremely late. They apologized for it, which I do appreciate, however, I was a bit irked because friends of theirs came in well after us and after I had ordered my food, and sat down and had their meals before us.
The food seemed to be coming out of the kitchen no where near in order.
My pho was ok. I prefer a sweeter pho, but that's just me. I was given extra tripe which was great, however I asked for fish sauce and never heard back on that request. Also, my beef in my pho was not good. I was given all the cuts that still had loads of fat on it, so I didn't bother eating much of my meat. Otherwise, my pho was ok.
My husbands meal came out and again, we received the wrong order. It was the vermicelli bowl but he got pork instead of chicken. He ate it just because we didn't want to wait any longer and it seemed like we were just getting wrong orders here and there so we didn't even bother.

All in all, my husband and I both agree we will give them a try again. I love having a local place to grab some pho and other dishes, especially when I don't feel like making pho at home! 
They did apologize for everything and gave us 15% off which we appreciate, but admittedly, this was not a great meal experience.

Their servers were very nice but did not seem to have focus that day. We had 3 different people serving us. So I think if there is more focus on covering a few tables so we all get the service we request and correct meals, then I think it will be great.

Don't let my review stop you from visiting! I can only review though based on my experience.
I will edit after we visit again!"}
{"text":"Definitely not so traditional for sushi... example I got a spicy tuna roll and spicy tuna salad asked for \"spicy mayo on the side\" and the server laughed and was like I don't know if we have that but if we do I will let you know and put it on the side... well their spicy mayo / spicy sauce bc that's what you should call it came all over my food. It was like a sweet n sour sauce but spicy. Wasn't a huge fan. Service was below average and we were the only ones in there prior to ordering then after that there was one other person. we waited about 4-5 minutes before the server came up to us. Unfortunately, no reason to go back."}
{"text":"Boiled noodles that was the flavor of my dish.  When you think of Thai and Vietnamese you generally think overwhelming strong flavors.  This place was horrid the chef needs to at least discover salt, a few more seasoning would also be nice but at least it wouldn't taste just like boiled noodles."}
{"text":"I liked the appetizers but the entrees were just okay.  Fast food Asian."}
{"text":"Sushi happy hour (20% off) from 3 PM to 6 PM every day, and goes until 9 PM on Wednesday! We got the shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, and the Las Vegas (salmon, crab, and cream cheese, and the whole thing was deep fried) rolls and they were all decent. The specialty rolls like the Las Vegas are definitely worth a try, especially during happy hour. Crab rangoon came out piping hot, crispy the way it should be. The crispy duck noodle soup was delicious, I highly recommend it! The duck was super flavorful and the skin was perfectly crispy as promised. The Hawaiian fried rice was not as great, it was a little mushy. The service was great too, our waitress was really friendly. They have a parking lot so it's very easy to get to."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! The orange chicken was delicious, a little tomatoey. The monster roll was incredible! Coconut rice was good as well. Didn't expect to enjoy too much, and didn't expect the staff to be so pleasant. The name could be something that helps define their food instead of McKnight Kitchen. But I believe we have found a new place to go to for Asian cuisine. We will be back again."}
{"text":"We late on a Thursday night. The sign in the front says to order at the counter but we were seated with menus. We had the pho and pad see ew.  Both were very tasty. Our waiter brought out the wrong entree at first but corrected the issue within minutes. We also received a complimentary piece of tempura cheesecake for the mix up. The cheesecake was amazing. A good Thai place was definitely needed in this area!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my food here.  I ordered unagi nigiri and red curry with chicken. It was delicious.  For the curry's level of spiciness, I chose a 3 (out of 5).  It was a little mild so next time I will definitely go for a 4 or 5.  Aside from the food, the restaurant was nice and clean and the waitress was very friendly.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised with the Pho here, especially the broth. It was delicate and tasty, not overloaded with sodium, mmm. The establishment is nothing special. Small but adequate, although they needed to turn up the heat. It was chilly and drafty inside due to the fact that it was only 11 degrees outside. Service was adequate. Beware the spring rolls are blazing hot, I burned my lip on mine!"}
{"text":"The sashimi dish tasted super fresh and delicious.  The duck ramen dish was good but sashimi was excellent. Fast, friendly service, reasonable prices.  Very clean look."}
{"text":"Craved sushi and went here for take out for convenience... they had some odd rolls and I couldn't  find exactly what I wanted so I settled. When I got home yellow tail  had a bone in it. Wouldn't get sushi here again but my try some other dishes

Update from my first 3 star review- down to 2.

Ordered a double cashew chicken and spring rolls to go. Got home and the \"double\" was 1 cup of rice and less than half a bowl of chicken and veggies. The chicken was basically 10 shards. It also tasted like old garbage. It cost $20 dollars. Skip this place and go somewhere else where not only will you get what you pay for in terms of quantity but quality as well.

2 bad experiences and I won't be back for a 3rd"}
{"text":"Not so good

Tom ka soup was sweet and flavorless and had canned mushrooms in it 

Pad see ew greasy and flavorless

Pumpkin curry was ok but on the sweet side 

I heard a little kid in the kitchen  
I think they bring the kid to work

Misspellings on the menu

Bettered and others"}
{"text":"They have potential, but they need a little work.  We went for lunch on a Sunday.  The lunch prices were reasonable and I was both excited and overwhelmed by the number of choices.   they aren't Cheesecake Factory crazy, but their menu and concept could stand for some editing.   Too many cuisines and too many options.  I wanted to try bento box and probably should have, but I went with the crab rangoons and some pad Thai.  The rangoons were curried, which again, was a little muddled.  They weren't bad, but I wouldn't order them again.  The pad thai was actually quite tasty and I was pleased to see that they aren't afraid of spice.  I ordered a 3 out of 5 and it was perfect.  Enough to feel it, but not so much that you struggle to eat it.   The lunch entrees were supposed to come with soup or salad, but our server skipped that part.  We had her bring them at the end just to try.  The ginger salad (think Japanese restaurant) was definitely lackluster (the dressing wasn't good at all), so I'd try the soup next time.   

All in all, service and concept need work, but there were some things that I found promising about the place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch today and found the food and staff to be excellent! I chose the for Vermicelli with pork and spring rolls and absolutely loved them both. Only two others in the restaurant this afternoon and their food was as visually appealing as mine was. Can't say enough good things and I look forward to coming here again...thanks for the great food and service!"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous!  Had the seaweed salad which was very fresh and flavorful - slightly smokey flavor with nice touch of sesame seeds. My friend had the Crabby cowboy and Green Caterpillar rolls.  I had the Captain Crunch (lunch special roll) and the Smoked Salmon Crunchy roll.  Absolutely delicious.  Better than Slippery Mermaid with larger selection.  Had the smoked salmon at Slippery Mermaid and cannot compare in flavor to McKnight Kitchen. 
Can't wait to go back and try the entire menu as the Thai and Pho items look really good.  The staff is so friendly too."}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by appearances.... this restaurant is located in a building previously owned by a failed Mexican chain and then a mediocre burger joint.  Very little redecorating has been done.  You have to penetrate past the veil of previous failures.   Not a good start.... however that is my only critique.   We ordered four entrees, including the pho and pad thai.  Everything was delicious, fresh and served up hot.  Friendly waitress, and a tiny error in our order was handled very graciously. Not crowded and not expensive.... I think the third time is truly a charm for this location.

Being the only pho in McKnight Road does not diminish the well earned title of best pho on McKnight Road.  Yum!"}
{"text":"This restaurant takes over the ol' Burger 21 place that occupied the venue for about 6 months to a year.  The signs for burgers shakes and fries on the bright red awnings are painted over with black. 

The interior is definitely malt shop chic, an asian fusion restaurant possessing the body of a burger joint, still, they make it work...the shake counter is now a sushi bar.  

There are some growing pains it would seem.  When I walked in it took what felt like an awkwardly long time for the young man behind the register to glance up at me from what he was working on (phone?).  It may have only been 30 seconds, but when you're standing in front of someone who doesn't look up, it seems like forever.  

The place was relatively empty.  The booths lining the walls were filled but the interior tables were vacant.  He surprised me when he seated me by saying he wanted to place me at a table by the window so he wouldn't forget about me.  

He gave me the menu...and then appeared to forget about me.  

I overheard him telling nearly every customer thank you for your patience, but it honestly didn't take long once I'd placed my order to get my food.  

They must have been short staffed, he returned to tell me that the sushi chef was helping in the kitchen so it would be a few more minutes until I got my Arizona rolls, but my shrimp pad thai arrived relatively quickly.  

They brought my sushi out...but it was someone else's.  They then brought the right order and it was delicious.

So ultimately...the pad thai was good.  The sushi rolls were good.  They did that thing that I hate where they left the tails on the shrimp so I had to pick them up with  my fingers to remove the tails, but I couldn't tell if it was on purpose.  There were probably six or so shrimp and maybe three of them had tails on and three did not.  So either they're inconsistent in their preparation, or they leave the tails on...either way, room for improvement.  The taste of all of my food was really good.  

When I got up to pay my bill the server again apologized for the wait and thanked me for my patience, noting that...as I could see...everyone came all at once.  But...it was still just as half full as it had been when I showed up.  

Whatever the reason for the apologies and waits and incorrect orders, they were all minor issues.  The food was good.  The price was reasonable.  The \"wait\" was not long.  I think maybe just a little inexperience on the part of the staff and possibly a no-show in the kitchen.  No reason to turn you away from trying them out.  

I would definitely go back for a casual lunch or dinner.  Not really a date-worthy place, but a good work lunch atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Heard good things prior to coming in. Ordered two appetizers, crab rangoon and summer rolls. The crab rangoon was good..I have had better but it's good. The summer rolls were big. It was more than I expected. It also has chicken and shrimp in it which was unexpected. I don't eat chicken so I had to send it back and get a new one which they were very understanding of. My main course I had panang curry. So Bomb! It was a thick curry sauce which was unexpected. I good surprise. It comes with zucchini carrots and your choice of protein which I ordered shrimp. It's a nice portion size. It also comes with a side of rice and there was plenty left over. I ordered additional rice to go for later. I will be back to try several other things."}
{"text":"Went here in the afternoon. As soon as I walked in, the first thing I noticed was that the restaurant was totally silent--they didn't have any music playing in the background, so my friend and I picked a table in the back so we wouldn't feel as conspicuous. A little uncomfortable, to be honest. That being said, the food came out very quickly and was absolutely DELICIOUS. We got crab ragoons and a philly roll to start. The ragoons have plenty of filling and were nice and crispy. My friend got the pho soup, which was a giant portion the size of his head. He said he enjoyed it. I got the sweet and sour Thai chicken, which was absolutely amazing. We ate every single bite and were completely stuffed! I enjoyed it so much I ordered take out from grub hub a few days later and ordered the same thing--which was perfect again! Probably won't be back to dine in though."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Saturdays ago with my wife for lunch.  McKnight Kitchen is located on you guessed it, McKnight Road.  It's in the building that formerly housed both Qdoba and Burger 21 and so is only accessible heading Northbound on McKnight.  The inside of the restaurant was bright and open with a number of booths and tables.  There was also an area where a sushi chef was making the sushi fresh as it was ordered.

For lunch on this day I decided to go with the chicken hot basil lunch special at the highest spice level while my wife went with a pad Thai.    The menu described my meal as chili paste with bell pepper, onion, bamboo shoots and basil leaves.  Then since it was a lunch special it also came with a spring roll and my choice between a soup and a salad and I went with the chicken rice soup.  The soup came out first and ended up being quite tasty.  After I had finished that my entree came out.  It looked fairly spicy with all of the red specks on it and its taste corresponded with its look.  The chicken was cooked nicely and my favorite part of the meal was how the basil paired well with the spiciness of the sauce.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Both my wife and I enjoyed our food and it's a much needed addition to the McKnight road dining scene."}
{"text":"Very clean and modern. The servers were pleasant and friendly. The Autumn Roll was a fresh light appetizer for 2. The Spicy Salmon was delicious. The most impressive item we ordered was the Green Dragon. This was the perfect mix of texture and flavors."}
{"text":"One of the best places for pho in Pittsburgh. The food is fresh, flavorful, and reasonably priced. The decoration is the best among all pho restaurants in Pittsburgh. Will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"The food here was so fresh and delicious. There are so many choices from Thai, sushi, to Vietnamese. Great spot with a quiet atmosphere. Staff was very friendly. This is a must try for a restaurant or takeout. We will most definitely be back here again!"}
{"text":"Food is really tasty, good size of portion. I really like big choice in menu. Comfortable tables. This is my second favorite place with Thai food."}
{"text":"Was expecting a Thai/sushi/pho sort of chipotle fast food low quality place. However was the total opposite. Everything was great, made with fresh ingredients, authentic recipes, etc. we got the wonton soup, tom yum soup, green curry and pad see ew. All were fantastic. Not at all what we expected when driving by in the past. Highly recommended. I eat a ton of Thai food and love Nicky's Thai kitchen. This place is worth a visit."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant in Super Bowl Sunday at lunch time.  What a pleasant surprise, the interior was warm and cozy, we were greeted straight away and sat in a booth near the window. The menu has so many good options, it is hard to pick. As appetizers we went with potstickers, Vietnamese rolls and the Thai summer rolls. All came out fresh and tasty. For lunch we had the Thai Fried Rice and Pad Thai, the flavors were amazing. You also get soup or salad with lunch and a fried mini spring roll. 
This place is great for Thai and Vietnamese food, they also do Sushi while we will try next time."}
{"text":"Delicious bento box. So varied and flavorful-I ordered the Pad Kee Mao, I believe, the wide rice noodle and beef bento box. The waitress was friendly and helpfully explained anything I needed answers to. Brightly lit, A/C on but not too cold so I was okay in a short sleeved tee and shorts. Overall, lovely little joint I need to visit again!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for an anniversary lunch with my girlfriend. There is a fresh sushi bar in the front and Monday through Friday they have a sushi happy hour! 

I ordered a spicy tuna roll and Pho #1 my girlfriend got crab Rangoon's and the roasted pork noodle soup. The tuna roll was really fresh he made it right at the counter in the front of the store! The crab Rangoon's came out shortly after my roll did. They were crunchy and creamy a great appetizer overall! Right when we finished our appetizers our lunch arrived. 

Everything was fresh and to temperature when it came to our table. The serving sizes of both dishes were more than enough for two people. My pho was great! I ate the entire thing (barely.) The basil, sprouts and jalapeño peppers all were fresh and crunchy. I was very happy! My girlfriends pork soup was amazing as well! I would return and have that again. All the flavors were fantastic and everything cooked perfectly. There was too many noodles in the bowl, that's the only thing I could complain about. 

Overall I would love to come back and try something else! The waitress was polite and checked on us a couple times. Only negative thing was she was eating while we were so I felt awkward trying to ask her for more water. 

If you're ever on McKnight and craving some Vietnamese/ Thai food this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Literally walked in and the person standing at the counter was like \"can I help you\" as if I shouldn't have been there. A sign at the door says go to the cashier to place your order and they would bring it to you. She ended up seating me with a menu. Waiter came over with water and a menu then disappeared. After 5 minutes I noticed him sitting in another booth and decided I'd just go. Was the only customer in the restaurant so I would have expected them to be a tad more attentive. 

Was excited for this place and being they just opened I expected everything to be on point. Would recommend avoiding and heading to Tings down the road instead."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner 2 nights ago with my wife and daughter. We ordered an assortment from the menu. We started with the garlic edamame appetizer which we all enjoyed. The roasted garlic was an excellent touch. For our main course, my daughter ordered the ginger with chicken, my wife ordered the TGIF sushi roll and I had the roasted pork noodle soup. The ginger was very flavorful and had an assortment of very fresh vegetables. The sushi roll my wife ordered was quite flavorful and was quite a large portion. I really enjoyed the pork noodle soup. The first spoonful of broth had an incredible depth of flavor and you could tell that it was homemade.  The roasted pork was very tender and was cooked perfectly. Oftentimes it can get overcooked in soups and becomes tough. Not so in this soup.  There were plenty of noodles and the dumplings were a nice compliment to the soup. I think this was probably one of the best noodle soups I had outside of Asia. I cannot wait to go back and try some different things on the menu. I am sure I will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"In our experience it is hard to pull off pan asian cuisine without falling into mediocrity. But this place does a great job. Sushi, pho, thai food all excellent. Especially loved the crispy duck noodle soup and the crab Rangoon with curry powder. Overall a great spot for Asian food in the North Hills"}
{"text":"Went for our third visit. Great service but the food was meh. I had red curry with pumpkin and the pumpkin still had hard rind left on and wasn't fully cooked. Cut my gum. Shrimp was over cooked and a 5 spice level (the highest) was medium. Hubby had beef pho and it was not rare....over cooked. He enjoyed the flavor. Going to skip next time and just go to Red Orchid three miles away or head to east end. Really wanted to have this be better after a few months"}
{"text":"I love this place. Clean restaurant and delicious food. I got pad Thai and spring roll here. So so so good. I can come here everyday."}
{"text":"The won tons in the soup fell apart broth had zero flavor. My summer roll had very little chicken in is. Disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. For appetisers, we got soft shell crab wrap (great), bang bang shrimp (good), and dumplings (fair). My basil fried rice with chicken was just ok. My partner got basil fried noodles. I tasted it and the meat seemed tasteless.

The service was not very good. It was very slow, we never had a drink order taken, and even though she came back after taking our order to verify, they brought chicken with basil out rather than basil fried rice with chicken.

A previous commenter indicated that Asians seemed to get better service, but my significant other is asian and that did not get us better service."}
{"text":"This place is a great, a really unique spot right on the hub of McKnight Road. The space is open, modern, really clean, with plenty of seating. I visited on a Friday around 6pm. It was pretty empty with only about 3 parties. 

The menu is huge, comparable to the cheesecake factory. You have plenty to choose from here with Thai curry dishes, ramen dishes, chef specials, sushi and more - most at reasonable prices. The staff was very friendly and offered help in deciding on the menu.

We tried the Green Curry with shrimp and the Hawaiian Noodle dish with shrimp. Both dishes were authentic, flavorful and delicious. The noodle dish was a spin on pineapple fried rice, instead with stir fried thin rice noodles pineapple, cashew nuts and a hint of curry powder.
The green curry was different that most I've tried in the area as instead of eggplant it had bamboo strips. Very good! 

Overall, a really great experience! Will definitely be returning to try more of the menu items and for the sushi happy hour :)"}
{"text":"Been meaning to come here for a while. Finally got a chance late on a Saturday night to stop in. Resturant was quiet and food was delivered quickly. Very inexpensive for the quality of the food, and the food was fantastic. Ordered the spicy Ramen noodle and it was wonderful only problem was that my stomach wasn't large enough :-) also ordered California roll and spicy tuna roll from sushi bar and it was delicious. Larger than most sushi rolls around town here. Especially for the price. Only downside is they do not serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Second time here. Is it me or does all these places have sushi places serve rolls with mayonnaise? What is that? 9 out of 10 here has it. 
Ordered a $16 roll, it's $1.60 a bite. Cheap with the wasabi. Passable food but good service!!"}
{"text":"Don't be deceived by the exterior! Mcknight Kitchen has excellent food. I cannot recall a place where I went and everything was delicious. I ordered the lunch spicy ramen level 3 and it came with a salad and spring roll. My husband ordered the beef pho. The bowl was huge and the flavors magnificent. We shared a Silver Coin roll and you can't beat the price for a decadent roll topped with scallops and fresh jalapenos. I already can't wait to come back and try something else!"}
{"text":"I had a pleasant dining experience with food of the most exquisite flavours. For this reason I highly recommend going to this restaurant again! 

Tempura lobster roll was amazing! Definitely love it"}
{"text":"Clean, quick and efficient service, fresh ingredients and tasty preparations. We had Pho, Panang Curry, Summer Rolls and Chicken Vermicelli. All 4 were great. We will be back for sure and plan to recommend to our friends for dine-in as well ad take-out."}
{"text":"Good pho. Egg roll is cut in pieces. Not so crispy and different texture from what we've had. Nice and clean surroundings. Overall is good"}
{"text":"The server was very nice and friendly. Everything is very clean and nice looking. You can sit at a high to table or in a booth or at the sushi bar. We went for lunch and got they're lunch boxes, which was a pretty good deal. It comes with a spring roll, which was a little light in the filing department, but tasty, 3 pieces of sushi and 4 pieces of a California roll.   We enjoyed everything we ate and would definitely go back if we were out and about."}
{"text":"Holy cow!! They have the best pho!!! We even tried the sushi while we were there and it was great too. Service was fast and the ladies were so nice. We went here on a Friday and it wasn't too busy. My husband wanted to go back the next night he liked it so much."}
{"text":"Good pho and Vietnamese spring rolls. I'll be sure to come back and try the sushi next time."}
{"text":"Got takeout from here and it was very good. I ordered the spicy ramen (a noodle dish, not soup) with chicken and spicy level 3 out of 5. It was definitely spicy but not too much.  Good flavor and a good portion size with enough veggies and chicken.  It was ready quickly and the prices are reasonable. Will return !"}
{"text":"I had been here once or twice before, and had gotten some take out pho one time. We are not very familiar with Vietnamese food, so they were experimental meals for us. Tonight we came here for our 57th wedding anniversary(!), and it was totally wonderful. 

Youthful weekend server Mary has a Vietnamese background with a perfect command of English. We asked her to make menu selections, and she did. My meal, and I don't remember its name, was a Vietnamese plate with rice, a fried egg, pork, fish oil or sauce, and small servings of fresh vegetables. Mary even made suggestions on how to eat it (basically, mix everything together in the mound of rice). My wife had Thai fried rice. The food was truly wonderful. So was the atmosphere in the restaurant. There were many Asians among our fellow diners, which we took as evidence that this is an authentic place. 

We eat out every Saturday night, and we've now added McKnight Kitchen to our list of regular destinations."}
{"text":"Unfortunately they didn't have sushi today but we ordered chicken satay, garlic edamame, pho 1 (with rare beef), hot basil chicken fried rice, tofu pad kee mao, and southern kale curry (can't remember what it was called as it was not my dish but this was a soft shell crab curry chef special). The spiciness scale was 1-5 but even 5 wasn't very spicy. However the service was extremely fast, with appetizers coming out in 10 minutes and entrees within another 10-15 minutes. The satay was crispy but a bit on the smaller side, the garlic edamame was very good and garlicky. While the curry wasn't to my taste my dad enjoyed it and the other three dishes were great! Pho broth was tasty even though the meat was mostly cooked through (just the slightest hint of pink). All the portions are huge and definitely worth the value."}
{"text":"Good Thai food, but not worth the abuse...
These people are mentally unbalanced.  The food was good, but not great; the prices are not competitive with the local market.  The service was only good for the Asian customers I saw sitting behind and in front of us; I have no idea why they were so friendly to these customers and not to us.  For us, it was psychotic and frightening.  I told the staff that the service hadn't been top notch, and they went off the deep end.  They asked, \"What wrong wid you?\" instead of asking what was wrong with the food/service. When I replied that the question was not appropriate, they took away our bill and refused to let us pay and refused to accept a tip for the server.  They literally wouldn't take our money.  Then they yelled and screamed at us until we left."}
