{"text":"Wednesday evening late dinner (8 ish) in May 2011. Party of 2. Not crowded at all.   Waited about 3 minutes for the hostess to notice us. We were directed to one of their huge booths (could sit 6 easy). Fine by us.   General strangeness upon seating, with mentions from the hostess of how the silverware wasn't right for this particular time of day. The server also seemed a little flustered with not knowing where to drop off his tray so he could take our order.   Slow service on the drinks.  I mentioned to my wife that the barley was almost done growing so they could then begin brewing my beer. Breadsticks were tasty, with cold sticks - hot marinara.  Would have preferred warm sticks but whatever.   Over 20 min to get a side salad after the dinner order. If it weren't for the soft jazz playing we may have heard crickets.   That was weird, since we know one of the other servers only had 3 tables.   By the way, it should be noted that I'm writing this review while waiting for a side salad. Really?  Note to the owners - don't give people like me enough time while waiting for a side salad to write a negative review.   Side note - please contact me if you enjoy constructive criticism and like social media's ability to improve your business. I'd be happy to update my review based on our one previous visit and your steps towards improving this goofy issue with service.   Why?  Best Italian Beef sandwich in town. It's insane. Really.   Anyway, we've been here 30 min now and no sign of a salad or a replacement of breadsticks or anything. Update, it just got here, Chef Boyardee be praised!    The house Italian dressing is getting high marks. Now we have been here for 45 minutes with no entrees visible. Server just stopped by with overcooked breadsticks (requested 30 min ago) and after I inquired about the delay was very apologetic saying they were assigned too many tables.  A few moments later dinner arrived and we were offered free dessert or drinks when I noted the time.   Meatball pasta w/ marinara got a good review, guess it had a bit of a kick.   The seafood Alfredo was ok, would have preferred more seafood, but I would normally have ordered the Italian beef sandwich if some recent dental work wasn't giving me trouble. And it looks like we get to take one home for free. Good job guys.   A begrudging 3 stars, because the food is pretty good, and more than anything we were appreciative of the complimentary sandwich and recognition of the problem,  but the service needs some serious work.     Hold that thought.  That last paragraph was written a few minutes before the check arrived - and guess what?  The check overcharged us with an item we didn't order.  You just lost another star because I wasn't in a great mood after the rest of this fiasco.  I'll be back, but I'm bringing the take out menu with me because for now I think I'd rather call ahead and avoid having to waste my time."}
{"text":"Bella Vita is a new Italian restaurant located in a building where at least three chains have tried to make a go of it.  It's right across from West Towne but is located on a little side street that nobody uses, so I'm sure a lot of people see it and then just go to Olive Garden.  The food, you ask?  I really like it, but I'm a sucker for over-cheesed pastas so you'll have to keep that in mind.  The lasagna was generous with the meat (beef and Italian sausage) and featured digestion-hindering amounts of cheese.  The baked ziti was similarly cheesed.  Both are great.  I also tried the Italian Beef.  It was good but I think they were trying too hard.  Roasted garlic aioli?  Spicy giardiniera pesto?  Garlic-herb bun?  I'm surprised they didn't throw on the \"chipotle ranch\" and \"honey mustard mayo\" that adorn their other sandwiches.  I think the sandwich would have been better with just the mozzarella   Service has been okay both times.  The waitstaff can get messed up over who gets which entree, and sometimes sides are switched.  Overall, I don't get too upset unless I get the wrong food or it arrives too slowly, neither of which has happened at Bella Vita.  I recommend this place if you're in the area.  I would really like it to succeed since it's a lot better than most of the restaurants in the immediate area.  Bonus tidbit for militant anti-chain folks: this place isn't a chain (even if it feels a lot like one); it's locally owned so you don't have to feel bad spending money here.  (Nine filtered reviews?  Uh oh)"}
{"text":"My dude took me out to what we thought was going to be a nice dinner. Ah, no. We were seated at a table next to two annoying kids that were screaming and throwing things. Apparently, Tuesday nights are \"Family Nights\" Beware of Tuesday nights! The mother of the two kids said to her husband,\"if these two (me and my dude) don't already have kids, they never will after this.\"   Our server was nice but a little slow. It took awhile to get drinks and there was no bread on the table. We ordered and got garlic bread with red sauce, which was good. THEN, we got the breadsticks for the table. They were hard as a rock, you could do a toast on your drinking glass(which my dude did! he is funny!)   Food finally arrived and was rather unpleasant. My food was dry and salty. My dude's was super bland.   They gave us a buy one get one entree card, but we will NEVER go back.   If they are around for another six months that would be surprising.   Bottom line: Ahhhh Hell No!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant on the west side, burgers are amazing, great pizza, and very good Italian dishes"}
{"text":"Stopped there last Saturday- early afternoon, still lunch-ish. Very pleasantly surprised by the changes to the interior- nicely redone.  We were seated at a booth in the bar area, which was fine.  Ordered a salad with chicken and a pasta dish, two iced teas.  Salad was delivered sans chicken, but was quickly remedied.  The chicken was delish, so was worth waiting for. Somewhat disappointed that the bread was the purchased, pre-sliced kind, but it was still OK.  Overall, service was slower than I would have liked.  I really don't like waiting for the check  when I'm clearly finished with my meal. At dinner, it's an entirely different issue, but once I'm ready to go, let's get it over with."}
{"text":"Overall, an okay meal.  I will go back.  My raspberry mojito was syrupy to start with but things did slowly improve as the dinner went along.  The Gatsby from the drink menu was great.  It was very like a mojito but with basil.  The bruschetta was decent for an appetizer.  For my entree I had the red pepper pesto stuffed chicken with couscous.  That was good.  The others at my table had the chicken parmesan and lasagna and both were very happy with the meals.  My biggest complaint was the clientele.  Seems people rolled into eat straight from the mall across the street.  And the table full of kids next to us (and their dad in a sleeveless muscle-T... Dude!  if you don't have muscles that ain't the shirt for you!).  Felt like we were in Chuck E Cheese or something.  Definitely will give it another shot.  It is locally owned and they tried really had.  I thought the prices were very reasonable, too."}
{"text":"Really nice place. The staff was great - very nice and knowledgeable.  The flat breadsticks - more flatbread than big puffy breadsticks - were really tasty - and the dipping sauce was excellent.  My wife had a pizza - which uses the same crust and sauce as the bread sticks, and she loved it.  I had the Tortelloni - big tortellinis with prosciutto and a creamy (but not too creamy) gorganzolla sauce. Very much recommend if you like that sort of thing.  My son (11 years old) tried the swordfish and enjoyed it - I had a taste and thought it was good - not great - but I'm not a big fish person.  We all loved the sweet potato tots - awesome little things. Hard to keep myself from eating them.  The only negative was the cannoli for dessert - I didn't have one, but my wife and son were not impressed.  The place was not super fast at getting us our meal, but I don't mind a little wait. This is not Olive Garden where they crank out so much stuff.   Very much recommend. The staff was super friendly - offered suggestions - they even offered to let my son substitute his salad (he hates his greens) for something else without us even asking.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went for a drink with a friend. The bartender was pretty busy I didn't get much attention but that was ok because we were chatting a lot.  I ordered a salad and it was really good.  Prices are reasonable, staff was friendly. I'll try it again for a meal."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last week. Not too shabby - got the impression the were still working out the kinks but things were pretty good.   Got seated right away and hostess was nice and friendly. Atmosphere was nice - could go dressy or casual and not feel out of place. Got seated next to a huge group when it seemed like there were a decent amount of other open tables. Thought that was a bit odd since we were just a group of three and the huge group was a bit loud. Got some yummy breadsticks while we ordered. Menu was a bit ugly, but lots of items to choose from and lots of variety and good sounding items.  Our group had the lasagna, spaghetti with meatballs and a special southwest salad from their summer menu. We were all pretty happy. Spaghetti was mine and the sauce could of used a bit more spice or flavor. More bread came with dinner - I thought it was a bit over kill (and a little dry) but my wife liked this bread better than the breadsticks. I'm a fan of free bread so if they want to serve both, fine with me. My wife's salad was spicy hot - but really really good too. Portions were good and price wasn't too crazy.  The service was a bit slow and seemed unorganized - but everyone was trying real hard and had a great attitude and that goes a long way with me. Like I said I think they were working out the kinks still. We'll try it again sometime soon."}
{"text":"The WORST service. Incompetent waitstaff. we waited 1 HOUR for our food at lunch. Had to ask for coffee refill 4 times before a busboy FINALLY came around to refill water glasses. The food was nothing special and they were out of the soup. The calamari was served in A TINY pomme frite cone and was BARELY filled and COLD and rubbery. WORSE than OliveGarden and an embarrassment to Italian Dining."}
{"text":"Madison, if you weren't living the beautiful life before, you certainly are now.  My first experience with Bella Vita came six months ago when we were in town for a friend's wedding. A group of us were looking for a relaxing dinner spot - the challenge was balancing those who wanted to find the nearest, cheapest chain and those that were used to $100 a plate swanky joints. A quick search on Yelp sent us hungry and eager to Bella Vita.  It was a perfect choice. Relaxed, but subtly elegant, it was far enough from the UW campus to not be overrun with students. After long drives/flights from around the country, everyone was eager for a drink. Drink specials were on par and the wine list was tasty, yet approachable and reasonably priced.  The service was attentive, but not overly pushy. It helped that even on a Friday night, the restaurant wasn't completely packed, even though there was a steady buzz throughout the night.  What really stood out was not only the quality of food, but the value as well. The classic Italian fare wasn't showy, but tasty and the perfect comfort food for a chilly winter night. Stand outs that I remember were the salads with house-made dressing, handmade mushroom ravioli, and gourmet pizzas, which we all shared as an app. Prices were close to what you'd expect from those chain joints, but you could tell that a lot more love and thought went into the dishes. Perfect balance.  It was a great find to please the needs of nearly a dozen out-of-towners with different tastes. In fact, it was memorable enough that I suggested we stopped by again last spring when in town for a graduation with the family.  Now nearly a year into its first year, I can only expect more good things from this ideal little Italian joint in Wisco. I'll be sure to stop in again the next time I'm looking for a taste of the beautiful life in Madison."}
{"text":"We came on a busy Saturday night and shared the fried calamari appetizer, a build-your-own-pizza, and the spaghetti with red sauce entree.    First of all, the calamari was good.  The pieces were small, and it was greasy, but the dipping sauces (cocktail sauce and marinara) were flavorful.  The salad that came with my entree was extremely small but fresh, and the italian dressing was adequate but served in a large, wasteful portion compared to the small size of the salad.  The bread that accompanied the salad was average as well - I would have preferred a crusty Italian bread instead of the light, pillowy white bread served.  The bread could have also been served warm.  The pizza was passable, and comparable to many flatbread pizzas I've attempted at home.  No big deal.  The spaghetti with red sauce with meatballs, however, was extremely disappointing, and not remotely restaurant quality.  The sauce was incredibly sweet and watery, possibly due to improper pasta draining, and the pasta itself was mushy and way overcooked.  The meatballs served atop the pasta were chewy but had a decent flavor, and the extra serving of \"house cheese\" tasted stale.      I would not come back to Bella Vita any time soon.  According to the little blurb on the menu, the place exists because a few lifelong friends wanted to open a restaurant, and just happened to decide on Italian as the theme.  This lack of focus is also evident on the menu, where burgers, buffalo wings, and even seasonal items like creole for Mardi Gras and Irish for St. Patrick's Day.  This lack of focus and direction also informs why the spaghetti and meatballs sucked."}
{"text":"I wasn't even going to bother to review Bella Vita because I don't think they'll be able to stay in business long enough for many people to benefit.  We went in with high hopes and were impressed with their renovations to the space.  We were disappointed.  The food was just so...average.  None of us were impressed with any dish we tried. It was fine - nothing terrible; if they were offering these  Applebee's-quality items at Applebee's prices, I'd be fine with it, but their higher prices put Bella Vita solidly into the 1-star list in my book.  Our server was very friendly but made many mistakes.  We won't be back (until perhaps the next restaurant tries to make a go of this location.)"}
{"text":"I had lunch here recently and was generally satisfied.  I ordered a caprese salad which was served in an odd boat shaped platter, but was ample, if slightly over-salted.  I asked for a chicken breast as a side which was included for a nominal up-charge.  A potato leek soup was nicely seasoned and thick.  Two people at my table split a salmon dish, and the kitchen was willing to separately plate the split dish with no sharing charge.  Two others split a pizza and took about a third home.  The service was very friendly and attentive, in addition to frequent visits for water refills."}
{"text":"The food is good, I would go back, but I also wouldn't go out of my way to go there.  The atmosphere is very nice, you could go dressy or casual and feel at home. The breadsticks that they bring you in the beginning are very good and the waitstaff has always been very helpful. I've been there three times and two of the times, the meal was very good, the other time it was terrible. The good things I had were their pizza and mushroom ravioli, I would recommend either. The bad dish was their scallops, they tasted a tad funky. The funny thing is, my wife said the same about their salmon when she had that there. Either they have a bad seafood supplier, don't store it properly or have no idea how to cook it.   Long story short, it's good, check it out, but steer clear of the seafood."}
{"text":"A for effort, B- for execution.  The interior was nicely redone from the last occupant. Warm and welcoming.  Service was slightly slow at the bar, but very good in the dining room.   Wine list was decent. I had a Vernaccia (hard to find around here) and a Volapachello (sp?) that was particularly good.  Seems like they have been experimenting with bread, based on what I read on prior reviews. Gone are both the breadsticks and the white bread, in is a dry wheat loaf. The two flavored butters were great, though.   Hubby had the Italian beef sandwich. The beef was great, but the focaccia bread was the wrong bread for this sandwich. The side of sweet potato tots was disappointingly bland.  I had the butternut squash and spinach ravioli. The ravioli themselves were perfect. The sauce was a little thick, but tasty. There appeared to be some diced apples that were cooked down on top. Those should be removed from the recipe.  All in all, an ok experience. I'd eat there over Olive Garden and it would be a toss up with Paisans if they worked out a few kinks. For more upscale Italian, I'll stick with Lombardinos or Portabella.  I waivered between two and three stars, but it was a decent experience other than three or four \"kinks\" and I'd like to keep the local joint around as a west side Italian option."}
