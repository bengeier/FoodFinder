{"text":"this place is strictly about food and most definitely not about decor or ambience.

it's a hole in the wall for sure - so for that alone I would warn away from here if you're trying to be impressed by ambience or decor. U will not, repeat, not - find it here. 

All that being said the food is quite simply delicious. I'd say it's surpassed Hamdi's for sure. 

I love their free starter soup, so we can't help but going for second or thirds. We got grilled goat and beef ribs with spaghetti and rice as our sides. And the portions are healthy (should be for $14 a pop for each respective meal). They threw it all on a massive \"to share\" plate which we didn't mind because, hey, \"when in Rome...\".

The rice was amazing, wow. Goat was so tasty I had to fight my kids for meat, but it was a really nice spice. The ribs were succulent and not served up as a rack but cut individually with bbq sauce. YUMM! the spaghetti was, meh. Just boiled and some
Ragu tasting sauce. I would have given this place a 5 star (decorum aside) if they were remotely creative with their side spaghetti - but I guess it's something they have to work on?

The service is typical of the \"order at the front\" establishments - but the man was sweet and generous with allowing us to gauge our faces with soup. They also don't have place menus - or a proper order board just pics and prices on the wall, so don't hesitate to ask questions and get an idea of the meals! 

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Had rice and goat meat. The starter soup was great and the hot sauce (basbas) was a plus. I noticed they have a breakfast menu which starts from 5-12pm but will recommend calling if u plan to arrive early as I'm not sure if they really be opened that early. By the way this  is a Somali restaurant and is for non-Somalis to explore:)"}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite restaurant of all time. You are going here for a good flavor explosion. Get ready to have every food sensation in one bite. Spicy, Salty, Sweet, Savory, Sour, and Super Yummy all at the same time. Try the chicken or beef suqaar and make sure you get the bananas as they are important. The meat comes on its own plate and I usually pour it over the rice, pile on the Bisbess hot sauce (be careful it is sometimes really hot) then I pick up a scoop or rice and stewed meat and vegetables with the Bisbess and a slice of banana and pop it into my mouth at the same time. Welcome to food bliss. Wash that bite down with some mango juice and grapefruit juice and you have just walked through the pearly gates into heaven. Also ask for some chicken drumsticks and the soup. 

If you are still not full. Walk next door and ask for 5 Somali beef samosas with hot sauce. It's the perfect after dinner round 2. Trust me after all that you will Not be needing dessert."}
