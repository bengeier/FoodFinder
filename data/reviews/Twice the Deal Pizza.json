{"text":"The best pizza in Durham!!! The best price too. The way pizza should be. Big pizzas perfect crust. Toppings AAA. You need to open a location in Oshawa."}
{"text":"Thought we'd try this place because it is so close to home and cheaper than other chain pizza places.

We were pleasantly surprised to find the pizza was excellent.   Nice crust and cooked perfectly. 

They have lots of great deals available,  especially if you drop in and pick it up.

Will order from here more often."}
{"text":"TWICE! If you go to Austin or Sinclair, you know all about this place! The pizza is pretty dang good, I won't lie, and the prices are good. It's obviously very well placed for students. But on week days between 11:30 am to 1:00 pm it is packed to the brim with high school students, so if that bothers you then avoid it during those hours,"}
