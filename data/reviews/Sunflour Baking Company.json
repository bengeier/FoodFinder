{"text":"Two words: cheddar biscuit. If you're a fan of biscuits and cheese, and who isn't, this spot is a must try for breakfast or brunch. I get the #3 egg, cheddar, and avocado on a cheddar biscuit and it may be one my favorite breakfast sandwiches of all time. I think many others tend to agree as Saturday mornings at the Dilworth Sunflower location are busy. The space is on the smaller side, so plan on feeling a bit crammed, and possibly waiting a bit for seating and/or your food. To-go orders are always an option. It's worked out fine each Saturday that I've gone and I've definitely left happy with a full tummy. 

Though I haven't tried their pastries and desserts, they look amazing. Sunflower even has a number of vegan desserts, you're into that kinda thing. They do have a full coffee and tea bar. The green tea latte is delicious!"}
{"text":"This is becoming one of my favorite breakfast spots. I love their egg, avocado, and cheese breakfast sandwich. Their cheddar biscuits and croissants are amazing. Brought a friend from France who said the croissants there were the best in Charlotte, so I trust his opinion!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, mediocre and a surly staff. First visit will be the last. Ham and gruyere sandwich was mediocre at best- and like Lucy B too much bread, too little filling.  To add \"insult to injury\" the server handed me my takeout with a glare and silence. - and I even tipped on my takeout. I was warned by a friend, but did not listen- I apologize - G.S. You were right."}
{"text":"Their dirty mocha has me completely hooked, and I don't think I will ever go to the Starbucks across the street ever again.  I would much rather support my local businesses.  My favorites are very simple: PB&J and the Nutella sandwich.  Yum!

Next I will have to visit in the evening and sample the wines and desserts."}
{"text":"Sugar cookie with sprinkles and oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are definitely some of the best cookies I have ever had. Got a cheddar biscuit warmed up and it was delicious but for simply warming up a biscuit the wait took a longgg time for a to go order. I followed another yelper's recommendation to just get the biscuit without any eggs/meats etc and that was the right decision it can stand alone it's so flavorful. The chocolate croissant was ok. The croissant itself was good but the chocolate inside was only partially melted and had awkward chunks in it... Too sweet for me."}
{"text":"I haven't been on Yelp for a while, but had to write a review for this place! Stopped in for lunch yesterday and had the avocado melt (with goat cheese) and it was AMAZING. I'm a pescatarian, so I was super excited to see that sandwich on the menu as well as some other yummy options. Also I got an iced chai latte and it was probably the best one I've ever had. Love Sunflour!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, Sunflour is a pretty little shop and it's nice that a similar business replaced Sweet Lorraine's. I ordered a BLT with no mayo, a caramel cupcake, and a caramel latte. I'll review these things separately to be fair. 

Decor and personality - Great. Pretty shop, nice people, service a bit slow for a BLT, but they are a relatively new business. 

Caramel Latte - It had the longest hair in my coffee. In all fairness, I took it back and they replaced it, but after that, my entire experience was tarnished. Needless to say, I didn't drink my second cup. I couldn't get past the fear of gagging on someone else's hair in my drink of all things. 

BLT w/no mayo - Meh. It wasn't horrible, but also not really good. The bacon was greasy and clearly microwaved. The bread was a bit stale and the roasted tomatoes were a nice attempt at flavor but didn't add anything spectacular or a lot of flavor to my sandwich. I won't order it again. 

Caramel Cupcake - Pretty flipping good. The cake was dense but moist and the frosting was just the right amount and not overly sweet. 

Recap - If I ever try them again, I MIGHT try the coffee, but I also might insist that someone else make it and watch it carefully. It's still a bit off putting that a hair that long would up in my drink. I'd definitely try another cupcake, but skip the sandwich experience altogether. But I know me, so I know it will be a while before I go back. My 2 stars are for effort and the cupcake."}
{"text":"Chocolate cupcake was good.  The cake it self was moist but I didn't really care for the frosting.  The birthday cupcake was a vanilla cake with chocolate frosting.  The cake was dense but very try.  Tiramisu wasn't great.  No coffee instead they used dark chocolate chips.  I would rather have gone to Dean and Deluca. Hate to say it but we miss the old bakery that was here."}
{"text":"The cheddar biscuit breakfast sandwich is to die for! Truly delicious. The parking was convenient, although the wifi not working was not cool."}
{"text":"Sunflour Baking Company is a great option in the Elizabeth neighborhood; babies, children, girlfriends, couples, and grandparents all co-mingle and enjoy.  The breakfast offerings are unique and plentiful: cheddar biscuits, homemade poptarts, raspberry croissants delight the palatte.  And lest you need a walk on the sugary side, your sweet tooth will be treated to options galore: chocolate dipped macaroons, mini chocolates, multiple flavors of cupcakes, a plethora of mini cakes and pies.  You can quench your thirst, no matter what time of day you dine; choose between coffee and wine (and ice cream, but I digress).  Now all this flavor comes at a price - Sunflour is not the cheapest option, and it'll cost you some dough to dine.  If local is your thing, definitely check it out."}
{"text":"I recently went vegan and it's hard to find a vegan baked good. I bought a chocolate chip cookie and it was absolutely delicious. It was crispy on the edge and chewy center. It actually was better than any \"regular non vegan\" cookiee. This will be my go to for a little sweet treat. They also had a little cafe soups and sandwiches that smelled wonderful and I can't wait to try!"}
{"text":"Love the local bakery vibe. The food options are great for a quick breakfast bite or lunch. I loved that we could just sit outside on the little stone hedge and chill even though there were no tables. Like the flexibility of letting customers just hang out. We had their avacado egg sandwich which was good. The iced latte definitely hit the spot!! I'd go back in anytime."}
{"text":"I've been back a couple of times since my previous review.  The quality of the products is good, but I think the owner, Debbie, should really consider putting some more energy into her staff.  Every time I've been in, I've dealt with someone who acted like they were doing me a favor to pull items from the display case and ring me up.  The sign about unruly children being given an espresso and a puppy sends a clear message. I just get the feeling they want you to pay for your stuff and get out as quickly as possible.  I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"This is a great place to spend an afternoon working. They have delicious sandwiches and pastries and coffee. It's a little funny that it's in a sort of strip mall setting, but it's a lot cuter on the inside."}
{"text":"Just go there already. Stop reading this review and go. Get any of the cupcakes or the vegan banana chocolate chip muffin. YW"}
{"text":"Back in 2012 I wrote a review on Sunflour Baking Company...back when it was a little less known and decided to update my review. Still loving a few of the same things: 

Menu items-- I like the items on the menu (freshly baked gets me the majority of the time and who doesn't a cupcake?)
Atmosphere (sun shining through the windows, clean interior, chill environment). 

Mini-points
-They added Splenda (in 2012 I included this on my wish list!) 
-love the window down the hall that shows \"baking in progress\"
-love the tea (no tea bags here, just leaves!) Try the coconut oolong- it's my favorite. 
-Carmel cupcake is a must try

And ONE big thing! They have become consistent with their hours of operation! There are new owners and they have been consistent with hours, friendly service and expanding the market...they may bring back wine and add in beer and they feature the work of local artists once a month. 

This is a great place to work from, bring out of town friends to and indulge on a regular Tuesday."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night because I've been wanting to see about their gluten free selection. I had pretty low expectations since it was ten minutes before closing and had read a few reviews saying they only had one or two items available. I was blown away! There were four to five items available and a vast variety. I ended up purchasing a maple walnut cookie (really good!) and this this other super delicious treat, I think it's called a pecan bar? I has some type of crust and then a layer of gooey nutty goodness and topped with a swirl of chocolate ganache. It is to die for!!! My husband (non-gluten free) got a piece of the mint chocolate cake (he has yet to try but it looks and smells delicious!) and a cookie sandwich. It was two festive sugar cookies with frosting in the middle, which he said was amazing. I'm really glad we stopped. And the prices were reasonable, I thought. 

We also scoped out the coffee and foodie menus, we are looking forward to going back for breakfast. He can't wait to try a sausage and cheese breakfast sandwich on a cheddar biscuit."}
{"text":"Sunflour Bakery is a premiere fresh bakery with
The best cupcakes in town.  They offer a full line of fresh croissants, breads, cakes, and sandwiches.  Try it, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best cupcakes in Charlotte! The chocolate ones are to die for. Sometimes, I just go in for a chocolate chip cookie and a glass of whole milk. I also love the TAB sandwich with turkey, bacon, and avocado. It is my go-to when I want a fresh and flavorful sandwich. They get busy and the place will be packed, so not a lot of seating, and sometimes it takes awhile to get your food, but it is worth the wait! I always bring out of town friends here for a casual lunch."}
{"text":"Had lunch there and confused on the wonderful reviews .  Had the BLT and the bread was so hard it hurt to bite into . The others at the table were also complaining of the same thing . Sandwiches come with nothing and saw nothing on menu that shows you can add chips etc .  My daughter did have a cupcake which was decent but not anything special . Left disappointed and still hungry ."}
{"text":"We love this place! The food is always well balanced and delicious. I've never had a single bad sandwich or soup from
There. Both locations are great."}
{"text":"Good food, but since the change of ownership late last year the place has gone downhill. The owner was incredibly rude upon a simple inquiry on a 15+ minute delay on the food, getting aggressive and loud when a simple \"sorry let me check on that\" would have been enough. Her answer when questioning her attitude and asking not to raise her voice at us since we were calm? \"This is a cafe, not a restaurant\". Ive eaten here many times and the food if good, I just cant support Ms.Parrish and her rudeness. Single worst experience Ive had in this town.

UPDATE: In response to owner's response. I didn't deal with any server. I dealt with the manager who is writing the response. Checked on an order that took 15 minutes and she raised her voice at me. I never shouted, never insulted. She came to my table and raised her voice, questioning me why I thought it was ok to check on an order that had taken 15 minutes. I had never seen anything like this from somebody who owns a place. A simple rational response to my inquiry would have suffice, and she turned it into an argument and started yelling."}
{"text":"I went to Sunflour for the first time yesterday and had a wonderful large beautifully-presented cup of Chai and probably the best croissant I have ever had (including in Paris). 

   It was huge, fancifully- swirled, crunchy on the surface, buttery, flakey, and mouth-watering.  I had it as part of an egg sandwich,  which combined cheddar, spinach leaves, roasted tomato, and mounds of fresh avocado.  Absolutely terrific!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Sunflower.  It's bright, clean, open atmosphere is a nice change of pace from other popular coffee shops that tend to crowd up on the weekends.  Their food is absolutely delicious--I might be developing an addiction to their Black Friday sandwich (turkey, cranberry-apple chutney, and happiness) and their coffee is very good, too.  All of their staff are also super friendly and seem to be fairly knowledgeable about what they serve. 

Definitely worth checking out if you are in the mood for some good coffee or lunch.  And don't forget to pick up a loaf of fresh-made bread, too.  Their Rosemary-Olive Oil is divine."}
{"text":"Love their lattes and pastries in the morning and the dark chocolate raspberry cupcake for a late-night snack. They are a bit of a splurge for my budget, but I never regret it! Ambiance is clean, simple, and welcoming."}
{"text":"The butter bread was amazing, the green tea with orange fusion was excellent too but i dont think is made out fresh leaves. The club sandwich had great flavor made with real turkey. The lemon is was a little too sweet for my taste and the only problem was the whole wheat bread the didnt had good taste and the consistency was really hard"}
{"text":"A neighborhood gem!  Everything is AMAZING!  Cheese biscuit is one-of-kind!  Pimento cheese is delicious!  Soup is wonderful!  I get something different every time and am never disappointed!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for a late breakfast. It's a cute place with lots of natural light, and on my way to the bathroom, there was a window where you could see into the kitchen, which was a nice touch. 

I ordered the mixed berry scone, and my bf ordered the egg, spinach, cheese, tomato on a cheese biscuit. The scone was great. It was still a little warm when I was eating it. I loved how crunchy it was on the outside and soft on the inside. I did notice it was a little greasy on my fingers, but I ate it quickly enough that it wasn't that much of an issue. 

My boyfriend's biscuit sandwich was good. However, my bf doesn't eat bacon at all, so it came as a surprise to find bacon bits all throughout his biscuit. It would've been nice if it was described as a bacon cheddar biscuit, so for the few of you non-bacon eaters out there, there is bacon in this biscuit. For bacon-lovers, go to town."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a good pun? 

Nice Charlotte spot that I show off to my friends who visit from out of town.

I'm an advocate of their orange hazelnut rolls (you heard me) and cinnamon rolls. Vegan friends can usually find a couple options. You can find their Sunflour's twist on a few classics, like fig newtons! 

Their cupcakes are rich and decadent. You'll find a variety of things no matter your mood or time of day, from cheese biscuits to Rolo cupcakes to breakfast sandwiches.

As far as their drinks go, I haven't had anything that's wow-ed me yet. You don't go here for consistency when you're getting coffee - a vanilla latte will taste different depending on who made the drink. I'm okay with that variety, but others who tend to order one thing and have expectations might be irked by this. 

I have a hard time finding outlets, so this isn't a place where I do work. Most tables are for 2 people, although there's some wiggle room to move tables together. 

On your way to the bathrooms, you can check out what the bakers are up to in the back! Very cool to see them do their work. If I make eye contact with someone working, I'll get a smile in return.

Looking for a place that's open later? Look elsewhere - Sunflour closes at 7 PM most days, 4 PM on Sundays."}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop. They have really good coffee, breakfast sandwiches (Egg, bacon, cheese croissant and egg, ham, cheese croissant). The only thing they need to add to their menu is egg whites.

The baked goods are pretty delicious. The nutella poptart is yummy and great to share with someone.

Also, everytime i've been here the customer service has been good too."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE Sunflour Baking Company.  Although everything I have had from there has been excellent, here are a few personal stand outs.

1- The Croissant -- Unbelievably flaky, the entire way through. Not flaky in the first few layers and then fatty-tasting dough like a lot of other croissants I've had in town. It is so light and crisp, you forget there is butter between each layer and get carried away to another place  (cue the classical French music)

2 - The Key Lime pie is the best I have ever had. It is so tart and yet so rich and luxurious that it becomes harmoniously in balance. The texture is also the silkiest I have ever experienced -- almost like there is marscarpone in the filling.

3 - The chocolate dipped coconut macaroons - heaven. The macaroon part is so chewy and gooey and delicious and sweet, while the not-quite-as-sweet chocolate part tames it down and bit and adds a nice roundness to finish out a meal with. These would be perfect for ending a dinner party with a cup of coffee or a little Sauternes. 

I always talk about the food first in restaurant reviews because afterall, if the food is outstanding, that's really why we are returning there right? That being said I do love the clean lines and simple design of the bakery itself. It's not too frou-frou or fussy, leaving the treats themselves to be the highlight. Everyone there is always friendly and sweet (he he) and it is definitely, by far, the best all around bakery in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a specific cupcake (blondie cupcake) that was recommended to me and was pleasantly surprised that it was as good as described. The cupcake was dense and flavorful and the icing was perfect... not too sweet and didn't leave a gross mouthfeel like some cheaper icings do. 
I was, however, disappointed that there were so few options for the baked goods. Maybe it was close to closing time and they had already sold most of it? I wasn't too impressed with the staff either. They seemed bored and completely uninterested in providing customer service."}
{"text":"Since moving to Charlotte a few months ago, this is one of the few places I've returned to time and again, and made a point to bring out of town guests to when they visit. The coffee is delicious, the baked goods are drool-worthy (my mom is practically ruined for life after eating these cupcakes. No others will do now!) and the sandwiches are tasty too! If you are able, I recommend going on a weekday as it can get quite packed on Saturday/Sunday, but two enthusiastic thumbs up from me and anyone I've ever brought here."}
{"text":"Great little bakery! Happened by this place because of the construction going on in the road. I'm so glad I stopped in! Excellent friendly service and the red velvet cupcakes were to die for. Found my new favorite hideout!"}
{"text":"We need more of these in Charlotte.  This way I don't have to drive 20+ minutes to get my baked goods fix.  

I first tried Sunflour after a co-worker suggested I check it out for the cupcakes. I ended up not only getting some kind of Rolo caramel/chocolate decadence creation, but a fruit danish, a slice of carrot cake, an oatmeal cookie and a chocolate chip cookie. Oh, and a freaking good whoopie pie. 

Some folks have commented saying the selection could be better, and yes, I agree, it could be. BUT...I'd much rather have a limited menu with well executed items (moist cupcakes with just enough frosting.  Cookies that are crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. Whoopie pies that are so rich they make you want to take a nap after) than a case full of stale pastry. 

Love the clean light wood interior and the chalkboard menu.  The hallway on the way to the bathroom also features a big window so you can see all the chefs at work, making their magical flour creations. 

Next time, I'm trying the lunch items and like Tonya P suggests...the pie!  Drooling already."}
{"text":"A few GREAT vegan option here. Coffee with soy milk available too. One of my favorite go-to spots to get my sweets fix. Go earlier than later to insure vegan options are in stock. They go fast on the weekends! Friendly staff. Clean environment. Good location too."}
{"text":"Checked out this place this morning; got an iced coffee and a BEC with avocado. Both were delicious. The wait was long, but the place was busy (with good reason, obviously). I'm giving it 4 stars only because I believe it's a bit pricey. Overall, good choice!"}
{"text":"Great place, wonderful people , and Excellent pastries.  I would give this place 10 stars if I could. you gotta try the Magic Bar.. its freaking magical."}
{"text":"Holy batman that croissant is so good! I dropped in on my way to work this morning and was delighted to find that they serve Counter Culture coffee. I quickly learned that they also have the most magical croissants in all the land... at least in Charlotte. I come from a long line of professional bakers (I'm not sure what happened to me!) and promise that these will surprise and delight you.

The shop itself is very cute and rather large. It looks like a great place for lunch and a perfect spot to get some work done."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Always a good crowd!

Parking is a little tight. It's a great spot for a meeting with a client."}
{"text":"I have had many bakery treats from Sunflour Baking Co. and they all have been great.  I visited them today and brought home a capaccino cupcake which I've just finished devouring and it was so delicious I had to write this review.   Want a special treat?  Then beat it over to the Sunflour Baking Co.  They have something sweet for everyone."}
{"text":"Delicious spot on Elizabeth.  I went recently to grab lunch, opting for a tasty BLT+ provolone and pickles panini.  They also have baked treats (cupcakes, muffins, cookies, cakes, etc).  From a lunch perspective it would be nice if they expanded the menu a tad or perhaps added more sides.  Chips are the only option.  It has the whole organic / local thing going on.  Design of the place was clean and simple - it made me feel like I was in a Nordic country.  Super friendly staff is a plus!"}
{"text":"Review for their cupcakes only.

I tried half a dozen cupcakes here. I love all things Matcha, so I was most excited to try their Matcha cupcake. I couldn't taste any Matcha though! Their cupcakes generally tasted pretty good, but their frosting was a bit too sweet and there was too much of it. Also, I would suggest only buying cupcakes you plan to consume that day, since on day 2, they were rock hard."}
{"text":"I wish they used better quality eggs and the people behind the counter didn't ALWAYS mess up my order. But their food is otherwise fantastic!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place has fantastic cupcakes. Living in Charlotte, you would think it would be easy to find delicious cupcakes. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Don't get me wrong, I love Amelie's and Dean & Deluca, but they just don't DO cupcakes. So next time you need a coffee and a treat- walk across the street and don't go to Starbucks! :) Great iced coffee too."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Staff is friendly and the food never disappoints.  The cupcakes and cookies are awesome.  I recently had a breakfeast sandwich on a cheddar biscuit that was amazing!   Their rewards/loyalty program is legit too, always sends great discounts and deals.

Would like it if they had regular iced coffee...they only have cold-brew which is good but very strong!  

Otherwise, this place is perfect!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast sandwich - egg and avocado on an awesome cheese biscuit. The sandwich would have been a 5 if the egg were different (seemed odd, maybe steamed).  Great biscuit and value, good coffee, cute place. I wished the chairs were more comfortable, but maybe they encourage patrons not to sit forever when tables are in demand..."}
{"text":"Noticed this place driving by and decided to stop in.

THE PLACE: Bigger than expected. Seating inside surrounded by windows which is always a plus on sunny days, outside seating available as well. The display case was well-stocked with baked goods. The restroom is out a door, into a larger space and to the rights, a little strange, but this place is much bigger than it appears. 

THE FOOD: I'm crazy about macarons and they had 3 big ones to choose from. In the bottom of the case I noticed a 25% off box of 2 macarons. I felt so bad for those little guys I just had to get them, not without asking if they had fallen on the floor first though. Ordered a White Peach Blossom loose leaf tea and asked for it iced so they gave me a big cup of ice. It was refreshing in the sense of taste and that it was organic. It's nice to have options, oh and $2.00 isn't bad. My mother got a latte which was also delicious.

The macarons from the island of misfit sweets were a bit broken and cracked, but beauty is on the inside and let me tell you if you like chocolate, please get the Mocha macarons! Two oversized cookies with a deep, rich chocolate ganache filling piped inside and dusted with cocoa powder. The espresso notes are subtle, but enrich the chocolate to a point where it tastes like a gourmet truffle. One man's 25% off is another woman's treat."}
{"text":"I heart this place! Who doesn't love pastries, sandwiches and desserts? One thing that stands out to me is how big everything is. Now saying that, I feel the prices are a little high, but again everything is larger in size (my opinion) and everything is homemade.

The Black Friday sandwich is delicious. The cranberry chutney and brie just oozes out the side of the warm pressed sandwich (I painted a good picture, right?) 
I love the tea and organic coffee here. This is a perfect spot for breakfast or lunch. Usually on the weekends or early morning during prime times there will be a line. 
I haven't had any desserts yet, but they look amazing. 
I look forward to the Dilworth location opening! I must try the homemade pop-tarts and fig and brie sandwich."}
{"text":"Great cupcakes, pastries, baked goods, and breads.

The workers here are super nice and the shop is clean and cute.

I wish I could have tried more stuff, but I only had the chance to try their cupcakes. They were moist and full of flavor. If you're looking for a sweet treat, make sure to come here. They are also on the outskirts of Uptown Charlotte, so parking is so much easier here."}
{"text":"As a baker, I can safely say that Sunflour Baking Co blew me away while I was on my usual vacation bakery tour. I visited maybe 8 bakeries in 3 days across Charlotte, Raleigh, Durham and Asheville and this one was by far the best! 

Their muffins were at that perfect time of day where they were still crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. They are dense too which is a must for me. If I wanted an airy muffin I'd go to publix. The Matcha scone had a beautiful texture BUT as a matcha fanatic, I could not taste it, not even a little bit, so it was a good buttermilk scone. I could tell from the color that it was not going to have the correct flavor. If you are going to do matcha, DO matcha, don't be afraid your clients won't like this specialty flavor. 

Oh and their sandwiches were awesome! The bread was fantastic and their sandwich selection is great!

The location was easy to get to, there was plenty of parking and their coffee was great too. My only regret was not buying evern more things to try!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The lemon berry GF scones are amazing!  (GF herb scones - not so much). Love the coffee bar selections as well."}
{"text":"The service isn't the best..but the blueberry lemon muffin was delicious! I also got a cupcake for my friend & she loved it. I would really like to come back for one of their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Try the fleur de sel cookie! AMAZING! Gotta love all natural ingredients. Makes you feel good about eating sweet treats. Great bakery!"}
{"text":"Bad Energy. 

I try to support local business and really wanted to like this place, but in the 6-7 times I have been there I have yet to feel like they haven't seen me as a burden on their day. I don't know what it is - it may be because I usually have my well mannered 2 year old daughter with me and they aren't overly kid friendly. They don't have highchairs and claim it is because of some restaurant code (I go to restaurants, I see high chairs...). I have had other friends with and without kids in the neighbor share similar experiences . I just heard they implemented a no stroller policy (not confirmed).   I don't want kids screaming and running around when I am eating either, but address it if and when it happens and don't have a smarmy sign up that says unattended kids will be given espresso.

Other than that:

Nice clean design, they added a couch and some comfy chairs recently, I think that helped. 

Their sandwiches are lacking, but I really like their chocolate croissants and pop tart knockoffs - almost gave them 2 stars for the croissants, but can't get past the lack of customer service. 

Coffee is not great, but they do sell the Cokes that Earthfare sells as Mexican Coke - I think it has real sugar as opposed to high fructose corn syrup - that is good, but I can get that at Earthfare."}
{"text":"Can't wait to go here again! First time here and I got the almond croissant and it was out of this world. Flaky on the outside with a perfect crunch, and inside there was a layer of almond flavor so rich that I couldn't finish the entire pastry. So good! Also, it's tough to find loose leaf tea around Charlotte, and this place has 10+ varieties. I had the white tea with peach blossom. Highly recommend! Lots of seating too if you want to bring a book or a friend!"}
{"text":"It looks yummy however my entire experience was ruined when someone chose to leave the almond milk partially open, the lid fell off and the milk along with my coffee spilled on my dress and shoes. I live too far away to go home and change so that put a damper on my day. That was not too disappointing however the two register attendees did nothing to compensate me or show concern but looked at me as I had done something terribly wrong. Another customer seemed to show concerned which in turned lightened the expressions on the cashiers faces. The level of customer service was appalling. I have not tasted what I ordered however I don't see myself returning. I expect more from a place when I pay nearly $10 for a croissant and a coffee."}
{"text":"Best local bake shop/coffee shop in town. I live just a block away and frequent Sunflour. Cheese biscuits are awesome and you can even have a sandwich made with them. They are now open 7 days a week- wish they would stay open past 7 pm though. Coffee is local and fresh. Staff is fairly friendly and food is delicious. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving 2 stars because I have to admit, their food is good. A little pricy, but good. The only thing that bothered me was that on my first visit me and my friend arrived at 6:30Pm we ordered a sandwich each and sat down to eat. They close at 7pm and we arrived 30min before the closing time, but they literally close. Doesn't mater if you are in there eating, they will ask you to leave and eat outside. I worked in two restaurants before and even though we closed at a certain time, we were never allowed to ask people that were already inside eating, to grab their stuff and finish eating outside. That's just so rude! It was raining outside and my friend and I had to stand there to finish eating. It just made my first visit a bad experience and I'm sure never going back there ever again."}
{"text":"Yesterday I sampled their egg sandwich and a chocolate croissant. Both were fresh & delicious & worth messing with my gps to get me there.  The guy behind the counter was also easy on the eyes as a nice bonus:) Cupcakes and cookies looked divine too but I was already in a bit of a butter & sugar coma after the croissant:)"}
{"text":"Went here this morning for the first time. It was crowded, so there was a bit of a wait for our food, but it was delicious.  I got the breakfast sandwich with avocado, egg, and cheddar.  Sounds basic, but it was steaming hot on the BEST multigrain bread. My husband and I also got a cinnamon roll - SO good- and he got a cheddar biscuit which he thought was awesome. We will be back"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.
I enjoyed Sunflour, a nice bright looking place.  Not a \"watch out for hipsters cradling their laptops in dark corners\" type of place.  I don't think there was a single dark corner there.  No, its bright and happy like the name.
I leashed up the old hound dog and walked just over a mile to grab a couple of cheesy biscuits and a decaf iced Americano because they didn't have decaf coffee a-brewing.  They were tasty biscuits, I mean they were soft and cheesy so yeah.  I'll have to try some sweet stuff next time.  Everything *looked* pretty good in the glass.
Things that would be nice... maybe a little outdoor seating, for us who wander with dogs?  I think you could fit a little wrought iron table or two out on the sidewalk.   Aaaand while I'm at it, some more expansive hours... like till 8 on weekdays.  Or at least have a couple of people around to sell pies and cupcakes until 8, even if you can't swing keeping the whole kitchen staff on till late.  Now in the summer I can go wherever whenever, but if I get back on teachin' hours I usually don't leave school until 5:30, so I'm sure some folks agree.
So that's why we get 3.5, the food was better than OK but I don't know if I'm quite a \"fan\" yet.  We'll try to work it out."}
{"text":"Such an adorable spot! I love that they're just off central to avoid the craziness. Their pastries look seriously incredible - particularly the cinnamon rolls and almond croissants. 

I had an iced coffee and morning glory muffin. The coffee was good - I tried their honey syrup which is good but not suited for coffee, imo! The muffin was delicious - the perfect balance of crisp on top, moist throughout. 

Their staff is very friendly. They seem to be running a well-streamlined operation. They have the iPad system, which is definitely the fastest in my experience. 

I'm looking forward to being a regular here and trying out all of their delicious baked goods!"}
{"text":"I feel like Sunflour is like Jersey Shore-everyone watches it,  is talking about it and I want to watch it but don't because I fear I will get addicted and it will be all I can converse about. Well addicted I may get ....to Sunflour not JS. I finally got to try this place out and was pleased with it! It's a very simple and clean store with lots of natural light coming through. Their menu and setup though? Holy baked goodness! They had just about everything a person with a sweet tooth could wish for--cakes, cookies, cupcakes, truffles, scones, pies, pop tarts, fig newtons and you get the picture. They had a pretty sweet coffee selection as well and their Americano knocked my socks off! It was smooth and bold as an Americano should be. I tried the Chocolate Creme Pie with the help of Miss Tonya P and the crust tasted like it had a stick of butter it in which is A-OK in my book. The creme was whipped deliciousness but the whipped cream wasn't as fresh as I expected, it tasted a bit stale. 

But it's all good, I will definitely be back to Sunflour for more java and sweet treat and to support a local business. Banana and Nutella sandwich.....I'm looking at you, you will get in my belly!"}
{"text":"Sunflour is so delicious and everything is fresh and made to order.  Whether it be their breakfast sandwiches, coffee drinks or their cupcakes that continue to blow me away. I will keep giving my business to this local spot that is walking distance to my house- love it!"}
{"text":"Hopeful, with several attempts, this place didn't make the cut!! 

Ambiance is typically loud and crowded, surprisingly.

Beverages..
· Chai tea- pretty good, I've had better. I thought it was on the sweet side. 

· Chai with ginger- not appealing at all. 

Breakfast..
· Croissant- too crunchy and flaky - It's a sight to see, absolutely huge. But not as amazing add it should be. I've tried them now several times and it's been my experience that it's consistently not great.  I like supple insides that are tender and a touch of crunch on the top. This was too much crunch and flakes to an access. 

· Seed Bar- Way too sweet! I couldn't even eat a fourth of it. I got the croissant instead

· Cheddar Biscuit- Discussing, not very good!!! It was left on the dish after my friend & I sampled it. 

· Raspberry muffin- the only thing my friend ate all the way through here! So, she liked it. I thought the top was too sweet!

· Cinnamon Bun - the actual inside was decent, but the frosting was a major thumbs down."}
{"text":"SO DISAPPOINTED TO WRITE THIS, but 2 out of 3 experiences being bad indicates a problem.  I love the sandwiches here. And the croissants.  And the coffee is not bad.  But when it's busy (or late in the day), you'd be better off avoiding this place and going to Einstein or Owen's Bagel for your sandwiches.  You'll pay less, wait less and still be super satisfied.  

Because of a previous tasty experience with the Avocado Melt, I took some family visiting from out of town here on a Saturday morning.  I should've been wary of the long line and the lack of seating, but my taste buds were craving that avocado melt on a croissant.  When we attempted to move two open tables together, one guy told us it was ok (before we started moving them) and then another lady came by and scolded us for blocking the kitchen walkway (it wasn't blocking, but it was an impediment so I understood).  We moved them back but then had no where to sit.  Some chairs at the window bar opened up, and we sat there with our coffees waiting for all of our sandwiches.  The a/c was not cranked down far enough and we literally had sweat dripping down our faces.  We could not drink the coffee as that would've been unbearable in the heat.  We kept rotating seats so one of us could sit over the one functioning air conditioning vent to try to cool down a little.  

After 15-20 minutes, a girl came and took our number off of the bar in front of us.  We were puzzled, but then went to find her and tell her that our food had not yet arrived so we were wondering why she removed the number.  \"Oh!\" she replied.  \"I thought it had already been delivered.\" -- there was food in front of us (the croissants we picked up while ordering) so we didn't get too worried at that point.  A few minutes later, the cashier who rang us up came over and said \"I thought you ordered to go.\" I'm not sure why she gave us a number if she thought we were ordering to go.    But ok.  No, we're eating in and we're still waiting for our sandwiches ($60+ worth, by the way).   She says oops, let me go change that in the system.  We waited another 20 minutes.  At this point, we've been waiting for 45 minutes, so we asked for the status.  A lady told us that they were still in the queue but should be out shortly.  

Because we were sweating like pigs and basically dying in the overheated front window of this place, we were ACUTELY aware of the passing time as well as the turnover of other tables.  At some point in the middle of our wait, I took my toddler outside for a walk.  As we were coming back inside the shop, I held the door open for an adorable family with several cute blonde boys.  I watched them order, then ultimately receive and eat all of their breakfast sandwiches before I again asked the cashier for a status update on our order.  She appeared apologetic and said that it shouldn't have taken that long and went to the back to check.  She came back with the lady I assume was the manager who told me that my order was still in the queue and that there were others who ordered before me who had not received their food yet.  

While I would appreciate that position if it were true, it was not.  Literally every single person still in the shop or sitting outside had arrived after us.  I can state that as a fact.  I nicely told her that we were unwilling to sweat it out any longer and asked her to cancel our order and provide a refund if the kitchen had not started the order yet.  She did so, but it took her several very long minutes to find our order in the system.  She kept scrolling and scrolling.  This told me that our order was placed LONG BEFORE she thought it was.   My guess is that the cashier placed us as a to-go order that got produced and either picked up by another customer or ditched because no one picked it up.  When she asked us if we were eating in, she might've put it in as a new order, so it was therefore 20-30 minutes further along in the queue than it should've been.  

You can see from my reviews that I rarely give a 1 star and I reserve it for truly bad experiences.  I'm disappointed in Sunflour because I really want the service to be as good as the sandwiches.  But given that my first experience at the Elizabeth location was with all stale baked goods, and now my third experience at the East Blvd location was such a downer, I have to give up on this company.  I appreciate the refund, but I did not appreciate the manager's attitude toward me, as if I were completely rude for trying to cut in line by asking for my order over an hour after I placed it.  A little kindness on her part would've completely eliminated my irritation.  

After waiting over an hour and leaving very hungry, we went down the street to Einstein and paid $18 for the same amount of sandwiches and received them within 3 minutes of ordering."}
{"text":"I adore everything about Sunflour, the fresh coffee, biscuits, pastries, EVERYTHING! It's way too close to my house, that's the only thing I don't love (but secretly I do)!"}
{"text":"Love this place & their Almond milk chai! The chai is spicy and savory and truly delicious!! And their breakfast sandwich is awesome with bacon egg and I substituted goat cheese, yum! Their morning glory muffin is also a winner if you like carrot cake type sweets. I also love the croissants either plain or chocolate filled are magical! I also like the atmosphere and the  friendly staff."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast sandwiches! I love their egg, bacon and I sub goat cheese on croissant sandwich. The yummy flaky bread is incredible and reminds me of French croissants!! I adore their chocolate croissants and they are so buttery!! The ice mocha with almond milk is divine. The wait is massive on weekends so go early if possible. Parking is kinda tight on east blvd so try the back lot behind the building. They have such nice staff--
People are always pleasantly helpful. Local happy place with yummy eats!!"}
{"text":"My favorite from this bakery is their butter rolls. It's soft, buttery and sweet! They also have a nice breakfast and lunch menu. It's a cozy bakery to hang out and relax."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches & counter culture coffee served fresh. Sweet little local spot. My only complaint is that they don't have high chairs for small children. It'd be nice if they could be a little more accommodating to families. Other than that, its a nice breakfast or lunch spot. The Turkey Avocado Bacon was mouthwatering.
Update - they've added high chairs! Thanks Sunflower"}
{"text":"So I love chocolate croissants. Used to get these amazing ones in Cleveland, Ohio and wanted to find good ones here. I've tried the ones at Amelie's but they didn't do it for me. So yelped them and found them at Sunflour. They are beautifully flaky, and have 3 batons of chocolate in them so you get a bit of chocolatey goodness with each bite! Delicious!!! Will definitely be back for them!"}
{"text":"Loved the natural light in this space, the staff was very helpful to select the best cupcake--I went with the peanut butter chocolate because that's my fave combo. The cake was moist with a peanut butter filling and dark chocolate frosting--super sweet, but I like it like that.  I had a veggie sandwich, avocado, goat cheese, tomato on focaccia that was delicious, but could have used a little more sauce. Then I had a dirty mocha with soy milk that was delicious.  Loved my first visit and will be back again soon. (Wifi was okay, you have to get the password to make it work smoothly.) Great space to visit or have some quiet time and do work!"}
{"text":"I was in search to find a good place to get a cupcake. This place popped up. So I decided to give it a try, though I've passed by it a million times. By far the best cupcakes in the Queen City! Good flavors and great customer service."}
{"text":"Ok...is it odd that I wanted to find something off about this place just to knock a star off it's pedestal? However, I must, enthusiastically, give it 5 stars as well! Andes mint brownies, morning glory muffins, ham & gruyere croissants, red pepper & cheddar scones...all do good! Yes, I decided to order a plethora of items for a recent house party. When in doubt, buy it all :)

My favorite was the red pepper & cheddar scone. Can't beat a salt/sweet treat! They even have some unique low sugar carb beverages that are refreshing! Staff was very helpful and recommended the perfect items for my needs!"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place. A local business. I like pastries. It's just too often that I get a day old item. Or the wrong order - when I only order one item and the person taking the order is the one getting the item. I know - I should learn the check the bag before leaving:)"}
{"text":"This place is so cute! The coffee is good, rich and strong without the bitterness and the macarons are the best I have had."}
{"text":"Preface: Sunflour has recently found itself under new ownership so I waited to write this review until I went back a few times. 

Review: I am very conflicted with Sunflour right now. I loved this bakery for their sandwiches, the treats, the coffee, and definitely the laid back but adorable atmosphere. They have Counter Culture coffee, which I really enjoy, so the coffee is a great draw. Their treats still seems to look good - they have a great array of cupcakes (the Carrot Cake is fantastic but there are some I still need to try!), many types of muffins (the Morning Glory is holy), and other types of treats from whoopie pies, cake, pie, tarts, cinnamon buns, cheddar biscuits, croissants, scones, and basically anything else a great bakery should have. 

They have great options for breakfast and lunch sandwiches; I am a fan of their 'TAB' (turkey, avocado, bacon). They also have this Rosemary Sourdough bread that is, for seriousness, off the chain. I always want to buy it to take home but I know for a fact I would eat it in one sitting with zero hesitation; so I refrain. 

Clearly, I enjoy their food. However, the food is nothing if the service behind it is not up to par. I don't know what is happening, and I made sure I came twice over a decent amount of time under new ownership to let them work out their kinks, but the service has become extremely below average. The place always had a slower pace, and even though I'm an instant gratification person, I accepted it and enjoyed it for what it was because it was still reasonable. 
The second to last time my boyfriend and I came, we ordered two sandwiches and one coffee, and we could tell the girl behind the counter was not focusing and I was already preparing for a slip up. Well, 10 minutes later, no coffee, she caught me looking and literally gasped \"oh no!\" She brought us two coffees and said \"I am so sorry I forgot.\" Meh. Strike one but thank you for the extra coffee. 15 minutes after that (so 25 minutes after ordering) we still had not gotten our sandwiches and noticed plenty of others had. Finally we mentioned it to a different person at the counter and they were legitimately surprised, realized they were never ordered (strike two), had our sandwiches instantly made and brought out to us. We were annoyed but just happy to have our food. To our surprise, the man at the counter told the manager who came out, spoke to us, apologized, explained the new ownership and employees, refunded us our meal and gave us additional coffees. I was very impressed with their acknowledgment and amends to the mistake. We ate our food and chalked it up to a bad day. 

We came back again this afternoon, to a pretty empty bakery (maybe two or three other people), ordered two sandwiches and two coffees. We got our coffees quickly (a little burnt but not ruined), then our sandwiches came out. Mine was not as ordered (stroke three) so I asked them to please fix the sandwich. They apologized (the sandwich maker missed the line of what to leave out), and brought out a new one. It was again not as ordered (strike four), so I brought it back up, she apologized again, offered a free cookie, and brought it back out again as ordered. 

Epilogue: All in all, the food is still good but this place has dwindled quite a bit in my book and clearly has a lot of kinks to work out with the communication from front to back of house. Four me, four strikes is enough to hesitate returning back here, which truly makes me very sad."}
{"text":"Apparently, it's been almost four years since my previous visit to Sunflour Baking Company.  According to my previous review, it had a coffeehouse-like atmosphere with living room furniture.  I can't quite remember what it looked like when I wrote that, but apparently they've changed since then.  There's the counter, dessert/pastry display case, and then several dining tables and chairs.  

Our party of five went on a Sunday morning and it was very crowded.  Fortunately, by the time we ordered, a couple of two-seater tables had opened up that we could pull together (along with an additional chair).  They offer a good variety of breakfast (egg) sandwiches with a variety of breads (rosemary, multigrain, croissant, and biscuit) you can have them on.  Three of us ordered the rosemary, two had the croissant.  The croissants were HUGE, probably the equivalent of getting two Burger King Croissandwiches.  I tried the rosemary bread with egg, provolone, spinach, and roasted tomato.  The homemade bread was delicious, and reminiscent of Macaroni Grill's homemade rosemary bread.  The filling could have used some spices (or even salt and pepper); the eggs just tasted a little bland to me. 

We noticed, though, that the owner or a good manager must not have been on duty.  During our entire visit, nobody was out wiping the tables.  Granted, it was crowded and every seat taken, but when we left, there were a few empty tables that just sat dirty.  To me, that's not a good first impression when you're walking in the door.  It's just not inviting.

Also, when you pay by credit card, you're asked (on their iPad) for a tip.  You're given several options (from a range of like 10-20%).  First of all, tipping BEFORE you even get your meal?  Tacky.   Second,  the only \"service\" we received was that someone brought our food out to us.  Nobody checked on us.  And they want you to take your trays and dishes to the garbage, dishwashing, and recycling bins yourself.  What exactly are we tipping for?  I had to wipe down our table.  I had to get up and get napkins for our table and sugar for our coffee.  I had to get up to refill my water glass.  I had to take our dirty dishes up and separate everything.  If anything, they should be tipping me.  I'm not a fan of tipping at \"fast food\" places in the first place, but when you don't even clean tables, check on us, or take away dirty dishes, just what are we tipping for?  

So...the food is fresh and good, but the quality of service and cleanliness really need to be stepped up."}
{"text":"this place was so good. the breakfast sandwiches hit the spot, and the service was great! the space is a little crowded. though I could see how some might find it charming."}
{"text":"I had been craving key lime pie for a while and this place did not disappoint. Absolutely THE BEST key lime pie I've EVER eaten! Super friendly staff that treat you like regulars, great coffee drinks (and I don't even like coffee) AND they use real butter! You can never go wrong when you use real butter. The gluten free treats and quiche are also very yummy; so full of flavor. Everything is homemade and it tastes like it. I'm in love with this place. It's hard to find superior customer service and fresh, flavorful food in one place this day and age but it's definitely here at Sunflour Bakery."}
{"text":"Let's take a trip down memory lane. When I was 14, I was psyched to be old enough to have a \"legal\" job so I could go to work for an epicurean shop that made chocolate truffles, sold gourmet food, catered events and had a little epicurean deli. It was undoubtedly one of the major influencing factors of my food snobbitude.

Well this little shop had the best sandwiches, including a tuna melt that defined tuna melts for the rest of my life. I like my tuna melt melted, which seems obvious, but is apparently much harder than it might seem. In fact I would say fewer than 25% of my tuna melts ordered from other establishments are actually melted. I also like my tuna salad w/o drowning in mayo or a lot of celery. Blech. I also prefer my tuna melts with cheddar and on a rye or sourdough with a nice tang.  In the days since aforementioned epicurean shop, I have found very very few acceptable tuna melts, yet ever hopeful, I keep searching.
Eureka!! Today I hit paydirt and Sunflour has the most delicious tuna melt I've had, rivaling or surpassing my original tuna melt! It had a hint of lemon which really added to it, as well as dill and NO celery. Hallelujah!! I subbed in cheddar and put it on Sourdough of course.  I savored every bite.

Oh, but I guess most people don't come here for lunch (their options are admittedly limited to a few sandwiches).  They have a small case of sweet yummies including muffins, a cupcake or two du jour (one day it was key lime, today it was Coca Cola), cookies, bars, \"pop tarts\", buns (cinnamon, hazelnut orange, etc.) and scones. Now I have high standards for anything breakfasty.  I bake my scones lighter with buttermilk so they don't feel like a brick in my stomach after eating one. The Sunflour delivers. I would venture to say they are the best scones in Charlotte (besides mine and maybe those little butterscotch scones at Pewter Rose). Sometimes their cupcakes are great (devils food is best chocolate cupcake in town), but sometimes they're not as great and have crunchy frosting. Go for the smoother ganache frosting if you have a choice!

Did I mention they make gorgeous wedding cakes?? 

They support local suppliers and have plenty of tables and counter and banquette seating if you want to stick around, but it's not super cozy, so I don't see this place turning into Amelies. 

If I no longer had student loans and a mortgage to pay off, this is the type of place I'd like to open.  I could see it now..."}
{"text":"Sunflour is one of Charlotte's jewels. Although they are known for their cupcakes and other delicious  pastries, they also have a great selection of sandwiches. I love the tuna melt in rosemary. In the summer the awesomeness is enhanced by farm or garden fresh tomatoes. They try to source from local growers. 

I've been frequenting Sunflour since they opened. I am quite impressed with the changes they have made...padded seating, WiFi, enhanced display of products, and spotlighting local artists."}
{"text":"Very cool spot! I got a turkey, brie, panini with cranberry chutney spread. It was so good! Coffee was very flavorful and smooth, gave me a good energy. I'm glad I decided to try this place out! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This bakery is absolutely amazing! I had a muffin the other day and it was the best muffin I've ever had in my life. It was not at all dry. Not only does Sunflower have great food but they don't use artificial ingredients or preservatives. Their breakfast sandwiches are also awesome. I love that they have organic coffee and they even have their own version of a pumpkin spice latte that does not have all of the bad ingredients the Starbucks latte has. I stop here most mornings on my way to work. The only reason I'm giving four stars rather than five is because we went one Sunday for a meeting either our realtor and the ac wasn't on."}
{"text":"This review is only about their baked goods, as I've never tried their sandwiches, drinks, etc.  While some of the baked goods are pretty good, many are overpriced for the quality of baking.  The cupcakes are expensive, yet flat on top.  The $7 individual pies look like a beginning baker made them..seriously, if a miniature pie is going to cost that much, there is no reason it shouldn't look perfect.  And they are ALWAYS out of their very good bread."}
{"text":"Great Place for morning coffee and their pastries and other bakeries were huge! Opens as early as 7 so I came for a coffee on Sunday."}
{"text":"I wish I could metabolically afford to eat more of the sweet treats at Sunflour Baking Company! Their pastries, cupcakes, pie slices, croissants and other delicious sweets are affordable and the staff is so kind. I've never eaten anything in the bakery itself as I always take my goodies home, but the couches and ambiance seem so inviting! I absolutely die for the pumpkin whoopie pie and have to enjoy it in two separate sittings because it is so sweet. (Trust me, I don't mind one bit.)

Their croissants are really large and it's amazing how many freakin' layers are in these things! You can immediately tell how much time and care the bakers put into these flaky pastries. I usually stock up on several goodies from Sunflour in one trip and savor them over a couple days (if they even last that long!) Do I dare say their baked goods may be better than another certain popular bakery in town beginning with an \"A'? Eep!

Sunflour Baking Company, keep doing what you're doing. You guys rock!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick breakfast. The place is beautiful and clean with a lot of natural light which is nice in the morning. The food was so good! Got a blueberry croissant which I had every intention of taking home to share with my husband but before I knew it it was all gone! Oops! Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I had a very tasty sandwich on freshly-made bread. There are many sandwich options and also many sweets to choose from. It's a cozy little restaurant with friendly staff. Parking is difficult on a crowded day; the spaces are tiny and limited."}
{"text":"I always love coming here for treats, coffee and work. The spot is adorable on East Blvd and I love all the open windows making the space naturally bright and airy. The fig and Brie sandwich is my favorite. You also can't go to Sunflour without trying their famous cheddar biscuit! I also happen to like the cinnamon bun - it's big enough for 2, but tasty enough to finish on your own. You can get on their points/rewards system so every time you buy something you get points. I just wish I lived closer to Sunflour, but I'd probably spend all my time here."}
{"text":"great place, staff is super friendly and the bakery products are off the charts good!"}
{"text":"We were renting a house a few blocks away and I quickly found this awesome cafe and bakery.  I stopped in every morning for the entire week.

The Great:
-  The baked goods.  The croissant were amazing - flaky, buttery, decadent and delicious.  I can honestly say it was the best croissant I've had in the U.S. 
-  The staff.  Friendly and helpful.
-  POS system.  I loved getting my receipts emailed to me (great for expense reports!)

The Average:
o  The panini press sandwiches were decent, but after tasting the baked goods, why order a sandwich?
o  The coffee.  The drip coffee was good, but not astounding.  The latte was also A-OK, but the foam was a bit limp and the coffee tasted a touch burned.  With that said, it was completely satisfying.

Overall a solid 4 stars and I look forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"I actually wasn't overly impressed with my blueberry croissant! So sad because everyone raves about this bakery. I am totally willing to give it another shot and I think next time I'll order the cinnamon bun or a lunch sandwich. I've had a breakfast sandwich before and the avocado sold me on it. There just wasn't much taste to this blueberry pastry although it sure looks pretty. The pastry was very flaky but I just needed some more flavor, like vanilla or cinnamon! The Americano with steamed milk was pretty good, and it is a great atmosphere for working or lunch dates/meetings. I observed quite a few business lunches and couples meeting for lunch!"}
{"text":"It took a while to get our sandwiches - not too long but longer than we thought.  
We ordered 4 sandwiches;
My Son had TAB - he liked it.
Daughter had tomato pimento panini- best sandwich of the four.
My wife had the avocado melt -  may too much pesto - she took a few bites and we left it.

My Turkey club came out last about 5 minutes after my families sandwiches. 
It came out dry - so I asked the waitress if I should have asked for mayo?
 she said \"no it comes with it\".
Waitress: \"would you like some mayo\"?  Me: Yes please.
Waitress brings me a 3rd of an oz of mayo -
We have no set ups (no knives, forks as we are eating sandwiches), I asked her if they had knives near there the napkins - waitress: no. 
Waitress - \"do I need to bring you one\"? Yes please...
It was painful - it killed her to bring me a plastic fork. 
Bread was fresh - counter help was nice - I guess one bad waitress - I'll try it one more time. 









I had the turkey club ."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. I love their scones, muffins, and breads. Always enjoy a yummy breakfast sandwich. The number 3 on rosemary bread is my favorite. Unfortunately the service is terrible. Ordering takes forever and the cashiers always struggle to remember what I just told them. On the weekends it is mostly teenagers behind the counter, so that might be part of the problem. Everyone is very nice, but the service does not merit the price."}
{"text":"I've lived in Charlotte for six years, and I've never been to Sunflour until today.  My husband and I got three kinds of cookies to try: chocolate chip, sugar, and salted dark chocolate.  They are all amazing.  Best cookies I've ever had, hands down.

Sunflour also serves Counter Culture coffee, which is a must try if you haven't tried it before. I got a cappuccino and it was perfect.  

It was busy this afternoon, but despite the crowd everyone working was super friendly.  They even gave us two chocolate chip cookies instead of one because they said the cookies were smaller than normal...but one was plenty for both of us.  For our first time, I was impressed with the service.

We'll be going back to try breakfast next time!"}
{"text":"I was craving some real breakfast before work this morning. A yogurt wasn't going to cut it today. Sunflour seemed to fit the bill and was on the way to work so I decided to check it out.

The shop itself is super cute and inviting. They have a beautiful display of freshly baked goods. I decided to grab a dirty mocha and a bacon egg & cheese cheddar biscuit. The coffee was good! The mix of dark and white chocolates was perfect. The biscuit itself is super super tasty! My only complaint is the biscuit to egg ratio. The biscuit is so huge that a lot of my bites felt like I was just eating bread. 

Great service and awesome value for the price. The lunch menu looked great and I think I'll be back to try that out shortly!"}
{"text":"Cute bakery.  The cheddar biscuits were not bad.  I thought it'd be like the Red Lobster biscuits, but they're a bit chewy/dense/dry, so not as good as Red Lobster.  However, the almond croissant was delicious.  Make sure to check out the two for one basket for yesterday's baked goods.  That's a great deal!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty great. Got a salted caramel macchiato, which I think was a featured flavored at the time.  It was a traditional Macchiato, that has a couple shots of expresso and one shot of milk (ends up being 1/2 a regular coffee cup full) buy it was only $2.75 and it did the job and tastes damn good too.
I also had a dark caramel iced coffee which was kind of toffee flavored and it was great.
But I liked their crossaints the best. I've heard they're  made in house, which I guess is a painstaking process, but the result is deliciously perfect and their sandwiches are just that good too. I didn't try it with with egg,  because I heard they were microwave eggs but it was good without.
I'd recommend going there, pastries and coffee are real good; while sandwich selections are expansive and pastry menu is smaller compared to Amelie's. It's definitely a worthy competitor."}
{"text":"If you appreciate an international flare and know what a good croissant is... this is your place.  Great coffee, selection of pelligrino, yummy pastries. Very cute place. The only changes I would make is serve salads and change up the seating so its not so formal, strip mall like. 

Other than that, the best baked goods any CLT bakery has to offer."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and their baked goodies are delightful!  The employees are very friendly and helpful.  They don't have a huge selection compared to a place like Amelie's, but they still had plenty of tasty options to cause me to be torn on what to order.  I narrowed down my selections to either a peanut butter blondie (think blonde brownie but made with peanut butter) or the pumpkin whoopee pie.  The girls behind the counter recommended I go with the pumpkin and I was not disappointed.  It was absolutely delicious!

They have a decent sized seating area.  I grabbed a table and read for a bit while enjoying my treat.  There was just enough foot traffic that it wasn't too quiet but it wasn't too loud to distract from my book.  I will definitely be back next time I need to relax and enjoy a treat.  I even feel good about eating unhealthy pastries here since I'm supporting other local businesses (they use as many local ingredients as possible) as well."}
{"text":"Small local business, let's support Sunflour by eating pies! They have the cutest, little baby pies, key lime, coconut creme and CHOCOLATE!  Enough for three normal slices or one just fat party pants pie. The nice girl behind the counter took two pies in the back for us and divided them so we could each take half with a smile! Now this is service!

They also have sandwiches, cookies, savory muffins all wrapped up in a modern little dining room with friendly staff. I'm gonna rate them, three pinwheels.

I would like Sunflour to make their coffee a little stronger. Please. PIE!!!

{"text":"Trying this for the first time, & dejected the blueberry cheesecake.  The almond crust appealed to me.  (It is gluten free.). VERY disappointed.  The cheesecake itself lacked flavor, and we didn't even want the crust after tasting it.  It was extremely sweet with a strange flavor.  It was very wet also.  We ate outside in a nice patio with Tiki umbrellas at the tables.  I believe this patio is for any of the adjoining restaurants.  We overheard people at the next table mentioning that a sandwich order one of them had was $15!  Our 4 inch cheesecake was $6.75 before tax.  We ended up leaving half of it.  Hopefully we just ordered the worst thing on the menu, or maybe this was an old cheesecake, but this experience has ensured that we won't be back."}
{"text":"What a great little spot. Located at the corner of Seventh and Pecan, Sunflour offers so many tasty treats. Made to order sandwiches as well as delicious baked goods and hot coffee beverages. Worth a stop to check it out and get a bite to eat. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"When I'm not in the mood to make something for breakfast and I'm in the area, this is prob my go-to for some breakfast. I usually get their #4 (Eggs, Bacon and Cheddar) on a croissant. Their cheddar biscuits are amazing but sometimes I just want something lighter. You can't go wrong either way. They have ample seating, good service except I wish the workers were a bit friendlier. Maybe I'm just there too early in the morningbut sometimes the atmosphere seems a little blah."}
{"text":"So my husband and I went in  yesterday for a little treat cause it's the start of a weekend.......I bought cupcakes to share with family and he got a roll ......GREAT....AWESOME... and the customer service gets an A plus.....going bake to get my (semi) sweet shirt."}
{"text":"Charlotte is finally catching up - this local & organic bakery made me feel like I was stopping in a cafe in Asheville.  Chalkboard menu tells you what ingredients are local and where they came from.  Stop in for lunch and try an amazing panini - I don't think you could go wrong with any of the sandwiches but my favorite is the salami - its spicy and cheesy and yummy.  

You have to save room for dessert after all it is a bakery...and trust me you don't want to miss out...the chocolate chip cookie was one of the best I've ever had and I am dying to go back and try a savory scone.

*Coffee is $2 - fresh and delicious - Starbucks might just get a few less dollars from me now. Hello Sunflour!"}
{"text":"Great place. Love the atmosphere. Nice and bright (sometimes too bright). 

Not much of a coffee shop vibe going on. Definitely more of a grab and go or maybe stay and eat lunch kinda joint. 

Central coffee around the corner has more of a welcoming feeling. 

Love the baked goods though. Nice and fresh and the big windows let you see all of the happenings of the kitchen. Great for the cook/foodie at heart. 

Gets 4 stars for the wifi. Not sure what the problem is, but it tends to boot you off after a while. Be aware of this. As my job is in social media, I need constant internet access without interruption. 

May be a better place to camp out and read your latest book purchase....

One of the good or great spots in Elizabeth."}
{"text":"Ordered birthday cake a week in advance. Was told it would be ready for pick up 10-11. Tried to pick up at 1030. Stood in prepaid line for 25 minutes with no one making eye contact. Then stopped some one for help. Was then told it wasn't ready at 1055. Horrible service. Won't be back.  No time for this."}
{"text":"Yay! Finally got here. Been trying to get out here for a few weeks now! 

First off everything looked awesome! We got cheddar biscuits, vegan chocolate chip muffins and a key lime tarte. The biscuits was cheese and soft but had s bit of a crunch on the outside which was delicious. The muffin was so banana flavored it was great and not that fake banana flavor real banana. Definitely worth it. And finally the key lime tarte!! Sweet and tart with a graham cracker crust. This is the thing that will make me go back! It is a must try !"}
{"text":"I came here for Saturday brunch with a friend of mine around 11:15 am.  It was pretty crowded, but we didn't have any trouble finding a seat.  I ordered the egg, cheddar, and avocado sandwich on multigrain bread.  It was tasty, but the cooks left the wax paper on the cheddar cheese.  I brought it to a staff member's attention, and she said she would inform the kitchen staff.
I also had a small cup of regular drip coffee.  It was good, but would have loved it if they'd had Stevia.
My friend and I split a s'mores Pop Tart because we just couldn't resist!  It was absolutely delicious.  Would have been even better warm.
Overall, I think it's a little overpriced and I wouldn't come here all the time but would certainly return."}
{"text":"I feel like all the cool Yelp kids have been raving about Sunflour lately so when I got a Saturday 1st meal to myself I decided to pop over and give them a try. 

Now perhaps a five star rating is premature based on one scones worth of product testing but holy hosenfeffer, Batman! That blue cheese scone was one of the beat baked goods I've ever eaten: not overly dry, with delicious lumps of cheese still intact, savory but still light and served on an adorable mini baking sheet. I will certainly be back to try their other goodies (raspberry cream cheese crescent, I have my eyes on you).

The experience of visiting Sunflour was as pleasant as the pastry. The space is bright and open. The staff was friendly and helpful. They even have a counter along the window, one of my personal favs, which is great for watching the occasional passerby or just soaking in done early afternoon sun.

I think the ultimate compliment I can give Sunflour is that when I went to the 'Bucks next door afterward their pastry case looked downright unappetizing. Oh no, I know where I can get so much better."}
{"text":"What a great place!! It's Tuesday morning at 9:03 and it's quiet and relaxing with fantastic coffee.  I'm a French press kinda guy and I wasn't disappointed.  Cheddar biscuit sandwich was legit with egg and bacon. I'm coming back..."}
{"text":"We visited this charming bakery for lunch and had the best pannini of my life (an avocado and goat cheese melt on rosemary bread, perfectly warm and crunchy but not greasy). They use high-quality coffee and tea. The breads and pastries are beautiful and delicious. I had a vegan brownie with ganache which was chocolately, dense and not over-sweet. We then enjoyed their delicious cakes at a wedding (salted caramel, chocolate and raspberry-almond)! I only wish that this charming cafe would have a compost receptacle for the compostable \"plastic\" forks they provide."}
{"text":"Fantastic bakery!  Almond croissants are my favorite and with each bite,  I feel like I am in Paris again.   Key lime pie is amazing too.  Everything our family has tried has been delicious.   Finally a real bakery in Ballantyne!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter Kennedy says the chai latte and blueberry cheesecake was out of this world.  The prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about sunflour baking and was excited to try it. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich and a vanilla cupcake with chocolate icing. Sadly it was all disappointing. They did not have onions or pickles so my sandwich was very plain. I also asked for mustard and it didn't have any in it. The sandwich was dry and boring. The cupcake was nothing special and was also dry. The place was cute inside and had available parking. The to go sandwich took more than 20 minutes. Was not impressed but would love to try something different as I know people who enjoy the placw"}
{"text":"I love Sunflour! It's a fantastic place for a quick breakfast/brunch and a cup of coffee. It's also a great place to go in the evening to grab a cupcake, pb&j (I love the fact that they have pb&j on their menu) and a craft brew or glass of wine. My only complaint is they tend to run out of ingredients during peak hours, so don't get your heart set on (for example) an egg & cheese sandwich on a Sunday morning if you show up after the church crowd. Anyways, I love that they're local, the staff is great, the location is perfect and I love the vibe of the place. I'd pick Sunflour over Panera any day!"}
{"text":"Such a great bakery of the cuff of uptown. Love the sandwich/quiche selection. Great use of local foods and making it even better, Organic, when possible. 

The staff was super friendly and helpful. 

Tried The sticky bun and it was delightful."}
{"text":"Beautiful, bright space to study, eat pastries or drink coffee with nice decor and a lovely bakery case. 

The coffee is delicious, strong and cheap. It's customizable with an assortment of sugars and milks, which I always greatly appreciate. We came for brunch, so I ordered a #2 on rosemary, and BF ordered a #5 on a cheddar biscuit. I expected it to come out panini pressed, which it did not, but the bread was still so delicious that I excused that. What I was disappointed in was the egg. It's not sunny side up or poached, but a square block of scrambled eggs, to which case mine were cold! Womp womp. 

I would easily return for coffee and a sweet treat, but probably skip the breakfast sandwich next time!"}
{"text":"Lots of great vegan stuff great taste not the friendliest people.. the girls to be exact the guy very generous and sweet..

Update: you should probably not stare awkwardly at us the whole time when we're deciding what we want . and then you expect a tip for doing nothing but being annoying thanks but no thanks slowly starting to dislike place because of your awkward presence like we get you don't wanna work there but at least act like it."}
{"text":"Went there today because my mom wanted to go very bad and made me order something so I wanted a vegan muffin I told the big lady what I wanted and she gave me the wrong item!!! I should've checked the bag before I drove off because chocolate breaks me out and knowing there is 2 other flavors she didn't recheck with me on which one to get so that's bad service don't let someone who has a severe dairy allergy go there and order she will cause them to sue the place! Will not be back oh and thanks mom for making me to drive from Ballantyne to uptown for the wrong order! And can you believe that they wanted a TIP!!!!??? Give me a freaking break!!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Wasn't sure what to get. Cashier helped a lot with blueberry croissant. Big bright windows. Nice seating area. Good energy. Great place to relax, read magazine, check
Email, or Catch up with friends.

Medium coffee and croissant was $8, including tip."}
{"text":"This is a must stop place when we are in this area.. 

Breakfast and desserts are yummy.. Baked perfectly with required doses of ingredients.. 
Latte, espresso and hot chocolate are good as well.. 
Tired avocado melt sandwich and cheese melt with Rosemary and sourdough which melts in your mouth.."}
{"text":"Best cupcakes in town.  Came here for breakfast for the first time and had a delicious egg sandwhich!  Wish there was more substinance to it, but it was still really good."}
{"text":"Let start by stating I come here often and always tip.  I ordered a triple shot latte in a larger cup so I could have more milk. There was no problem when I ordered but the message was never relayed. As I was watching and knowing I wouldn't get the larger cup with a dabble of extra milk. I approached the counter and asked them if it were mine and they said yes. I asked if I could get more milk and a larger cup she said we only make lattes in one size...alright I get get there's standards but you only have small and medium so I asked again can I please have a larger cup with milk because a triple shot is a lot to handle when you're drinking a small.  She then proceeds to grab the cup turn around and pour it into a larger mug (no extra milk) and hands it to me like I'm an idiot and don't realize it's the same frigin latte. I normally praise this place and eat here often but that was ridiculous.   

Oh and I've ordered plenty of lattes there with extra milk and paid extra for it. It was dead in there this time and no excuse for this. I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"Overall, I really like this place. I usually come once a week while I'm waiting in between clients. I hook my laptop up to the outlet and order some breakfast or lunch. It's usually pretty quiet from 10-noon and then it gets busy. My only real complaint is that I wish they had a couch or a few comfy chairs for those of us that come to work and eat. There are several of us in there that do work for a few hours while enjoying some nosh and tea or coffee. I've never had anything that I didn't thoroughly enjoy here including the daily soups. I also really appreciate their customer points that are awarded for buying items. I often get free items or discounts each time I am there."}
{"text":"Loved the Southern BLT. Had a great vanilla cupcake. Nice little place to grab some lunch."}
{"text":"So you went on vacation to Paris and came back annoying your friends and family with your non-stop talk about how out-of-this-world the croissants were and how \"America just doesn't get it....\" or something along those lines, to which they roll their eyes at your pretentiousness.

Well you can stop annoying everyone becaues Sunflour Baking Company makes a croissant to rival the City of Light's best!

And now they stay open late ('til maybe 11p?) on Friday and Saturday and serve wine and beer. THIS PLACE RULES!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite breakfast spot in Charlotte. My husband loves it and I get takeout all the time. We're moving within walking distance and I can't wait! On the weekends it's full of dad's and kids. It's cute like I picture the moms are at yoga or relaxing and dad is hanging with the little ones"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of quality sandwiches, you gotta try this!!!
I was initially headed to a burger joint when i spotted Sunflour and remembered that it was featured on a WCCB Rising/Local Fare episode.  Had the TAB (Turkey, Avocado and Bacon with basil mayo).  Fresh made bread, perfectly balanced ingredients, not overly salty and incredible deliciousness in every single bite!  Went back the next day and tried the Tuna Melt.  Once again, there was perfection in every bite!  Prices are perfect, because I believe in \"you get what you pay for!\"  It is a must try if in the Charlotte Area!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is Nutella Pop Tarts........

Every Sunday!!!"}
{"text":"So i was walking into Sweet Lorraine's, wait this isn't SL.  Where am I?  Apparently the store was sold to Sunflour Baking Company.  A little hesitant at first I realized the menu and the sweets look awesome.  There is now espresso, paninis, and of course the sweets.  This place has a very friendly relaxed vibe to it.  We got some cupcakes and I grabbed a couple of cheese biscuits for the morning to make some breakfast sammies.  The cupcakes were very rich and the cake portion was moist as can be.  The biscuits were still wonderful the next day and we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Sorry Amelies, you have some serious competition (and there prices are better)!"}
{"text":"Huge get the crumbs all over you croissant w/a rich butter taste that just melts in your mouth! Wish I hadn't been so full from the croissant I would've gotten one of the chocolate chip cookies or tarts that were eyeing me so wickedly.  

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Sunflour is where it's at for breakfast. They have biscuits, croissants, sandwiches. You can get a BEC biscuit on one of their fantastic cheddar biscuits or croissants. They also have sweet items like their hazelnut croissant- it's seriously so good. Every time I drive by my mouth waters thinking about their breakfast. Be prepared to wait in line, especially if visiting their east blvd location. I haven't had any of their desserts so can't vouch for those but go for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Pastries are excellent-- best in town. Love the almond croissants. Also love the orange hazelnut roll."}
{"text":"Great pastry shop in Charlotte. Love the quaint atmosphere, though small for the large population of regulars. Really out of the way for me but is ALWAYS worth the drive. As a Johnson and Wales Grad, couldn't be happier with the cinnamon rolls! What a delight!"}
{"text":"The place is great inside and the set up is awesome plus the food is great. But after my third visit it was the same pattern over and over again and as a tip to the owner please train and hire someone who knows how to make drinks. Each visit the people at the front were very confused and kept referring back to the three ring binder on how to make a single drink. Also very unprofessional when the person calls another sister store while making your drink and states I don't drink coffee ever and do not know how to make this. Power outlets are an issue to and there are only a few."}
{"text":"Go here when you're sweet tooth starts acting up! They have a variety of treats from cupcakes to croissants! I have tried a mini key like pie, a few of the cupcakes and the brie cranberry sandwich, all of which has been well worth the money. My favorite thing to indulge in is the Chai Latte!!!"}
{"text":"This place has come a long way from the bakery in Elizabeth.  Let's just say, if you're looking for a good coffee or a mouth watering breakfast sandwich or muffin, you really can't do better than Sunflower right now.  That'a big statement for me... but I mean it.  The cheddar biscuit....... lawd jesus YAS.

Also, the dirty mocha is an absolute must.  I have yet to try the macaroons the size of my fist, but that's next."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their freshly made morning glory muffins, however, I wish they would be the calorie counts on their products so I could budget my calories for the day a bit better.  The breakfast sandwiches are okay. I don't see the hype. I also didn't like my almond latte I ordered. I usually make an extra stop to Starbucks on my way to work. They do have a good selection or two of vegan muffins. They also use whole wheat in some of their muffins."}
{"text":"Nice, quaint bistro environment, but super hot, microwaved eggs on cold, toasted bread...not a great combination."}
{"text":"This is a cute little bakery in Elizabeth and they serve fantastic baked goods and coffee. We ate here for breakfast and had one of the melted sandwich's which was excellent and ordered a couple of baked items to go. The p-butter cookie was one of the best I have ever had and my husband loved the blueberry scone. The only, and I mean ONLY thing I would change about this place is to relocate to a quaint location in Elizabeth as opposed to a strip mall. It gets busy fast so get there early."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and ambience. Very bright and inviting. Their baked goods are beautiful and tasty. They have a very good service flow and although it is very crowed they move you through quickly. They do have healthy choices here. I have to sit with my back to the desserts so as not to be tempted.  I love their egg, avocado and cheddar cheese croissant. Give this place a try. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great local bakery with delicious pastries and coffee!"}
{"text":"I stopped here and was so glad I did! I had a bacon egg and cheese sandwich on a cheddar biscuit and it was really good. It was so big that I couldn't get my mouth around it and had to nibble.  Very tasty, will return!"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes, yes, and YES! It has been a very long time since I've \"wow\"-ed while eating breakfast or lunch, but on two visits Sunflour managed it both times! Darling, charming store with a handful of locations throughout Charlotte, this Bakery & Cafe is one of those places you'll want to take your out-of-town friends when they think there's no 'soul' in Charlotte eateries!

This place is similar to Amelie's in it's uniqueness but with their own spin on things. Think of a traditional French Bakery but with a bit of Southern flair added in. The breakfast options range from croissants to muffins to hearty breakfast biscuit sandwiches. The classics like a Bacon Egg & Cheese can be ordered on Sourdough, Whole Grain, Rolls, or (my favorite) a CHEDDAR biscuit. Why emphasize cheddar? Because it's grand, that's why! Don't set up an appointment with your cardiologist the day you're going to visit here, this thing is heavy and full of all the good stuff like fat and calories; you'll want to take a nap afterwards.

If you do happen to start dozing off after your giant breakfast sandwich, their lineup of Pure Intentions & Counter Culture Coffee will get you rollin' on out of there. Everything from regular Coffee, to Lattes, Espresso, Cold Brew, even Hot Chocolate. I haven't had Tea here but the list is impressive with all kinds of offerings, something tells me they know what they're doing with the Tea as well.

That Southern BLT, tho... Boys & Girls, I'm not a huge advocate for BLT sandwiches, but if you add pimento cheese to something I'm probably going to come shuffling in! Fabulously fresh from the bread to the veggies. The pimento actually keeps the tomato from getting the toasted bread all soggy, which is probably something you didn't even know was a problem before, until you get to the last bite of this fantastic sandwich and realize, it was just as good as the first bite! The bacon is really thick too, which is always a plus.

Their seasonal menu is just that, a whole MENU, not just one or two add-ons. Check it out for all kinds of limited-time goodies. Right now they have a panini with prosciutto, roasted peaches, and a balsamic glaze that I have my eye on for next time.

This place has won my regular business anytime I'm in the Elizabeth neighborhood. Look up your closest Sunflour location and drive, bike, run, or crawl, pronto!"}
{"text":"My favorite bakery in Charlotte!  Sunflour truly has a piece of my heart I do not say this lightly. I luckily have the privilege of living only a mile away from here and is one of my usual weekend breakfast spots. This place takes simple and traditional baking to a whole new level. Not only are the pastries delicious, but this bakery has a very friendly staff and a sweetheart of an owner who has always done her best make my experience pleasant. My only complaint is that I wish they had longer hours (at least on weekends) to complete with some of the other local (and inferior) bakeries."}
{"text":"Their cinnamon buns are the best I have EVER had. They are extremely fluffy and moist."}
{"text":"Big fan of the coffee selection- Counter Culture and Pure Intentions (a local, CLT coffee roaster)"}
{"text":"I came in here for lunch one day with my husband and friend and we all got the pimento cheese sandwiches. They were amazing! It has two kinds of cheese and roasted tomatoes but the real kicker were the green olives. The olives were salty and add a wonderful flavor note. The atmosphere reminded me of a relaxed coffee shop. There were some people in there just having coffee and also using their computers but it wasn't crowded which was great. We did go on a Friday so the crowd could be bigger on weekends. We sampled one of the cupcakes and a chocolate cookie. The cupcake was buttercream frosting which I am usually not a huge fan of but it was very delicious. I can't wait to go back and sample some of the other sandwiches they have here as well as some soup!"}
{"text":"Pinch me... If I haven't died and gone to heaven already, I'll probably be there by the end of the week, as a result of our favorite bakery, Sunflour Baking Company, moving into the Ballantyne area. My wife and I have frequented the location off of 7th Street for the past three years even though it's 25 minutes north of our Ballantyne home. This new location has the same wonderful pastries and sandwiches and coffee as the original location, but has a much more comfortable and sunny dining area. 

Quite frankly, it's fabulous. As the coffee bar to the left of checkout counter might suggest, the coffee here is not an afterthought like at some other places. The lattes are rich and creamy made with high quality beans. You can also find the some pastry samples here if you're lucky like we were.

You can choose either breakfast or lunch sandwiches at any time of the day, both served on fresh bread. My wife and I typically split the Egg, Spinach and Warm Tomato on Toasted Fresh Rosemary bread as our meal, and for our \"breakfast dessert\" we split a Danish or two (or three.)

I will probably have to quadruple my cholesterol and blood pressure meds as I will have a difficult time not stopping by everyday for the  next couple of months. It's definitely five stars and a Gotta Try in my book. Try anything, try everything!"}
{"text":"Their food is amazing! Coffee is alright but I wish they had more than just one tiny size. Macaroons are like sugar cakes, soooo sweet. Staff can be moody sometimes. But the sandwiches and muffins are phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Before I swoon over this fantastic little neighborhood bakery, please notice the spelling of its name. It's quite cleverly called SunFLOUR, not Sunflower, which can be a little confusing considering its logo and decor are 
accented with sunflowers.

Always jam packed in the mornings, this privately owned jewel offers delightful breakfast sandwiches on fresh breads as well as mouth watering baked goods highlighted by the flakiest, butteriest, most delectable and addictive apple turnover I have ever eaten. This is not your typical apple turnover. Get there early and, if you're lucky enough to get one before they've sold out, ask for it to be heated. Everything else is great too.

This place is a \"gotta try\". Easily five stars in my book!"}
{"text":"A Sunflour WEDDING!  This little bakery provided most of the dessert for our Charlotte celebration of a San Francisco wedding.  With just one week to prepare, Kelly at Sunflour worked with me to create a \"cookie buffet,\" - which was one of the highlights of the celebration.  Everyone loved these large, soft, completely delicious cookies.  We had: Rainbow Sprinkles sugar, Fleur de Sel, Snickerdoodles, Earl Green, Vegan Chocolate Chip and regular Chocolate Chip - the cookies FLEW off the table.  Thank you so much to the Sunflour team - you were accommodating, kind, prompt, flexible, and of course, baked an amazing quantity of scrumptious treats for our party.  Highest compliments!"}
{"text":"Such a great little spot to grab a quick breakfast on your way to work, or spend time chatting with a friend or loved one. Everything I've tried here I've liked. They have a good rewards program and I love that they have a shelf with a rotating display of local artist's work."}
{"text":"A trip to Amelie's after dinner resulted in spotting a line longer than Kim Kardashian and Britney Spears marriages combined. So what's a bunch of yelpers with a sweet tooth to do? Why pull up our yelp apps and look for alternatives of course. Thus we ended up at Sunflour Baking Company.

The space is light and airy, it really gives off a feeling of cleanliness and you can even see them baking up some concoctions through a window to the kitchen. Very modern, even though I prefer a more cozy setting when chomping down on various sweets and pastries. It just doesn't have that feeling where you want to get some coffee and dessert and hang around to chat you know?

I got a creme brulee while fellow yelper Leanne C. got a morning glory muffin. The creme brulee was rich and creamy, and I liked seeing the dark vanilla seeds sprinkled throughout. However this was more of a pudding consistency than that of a brulee, almost as if it hadn't fully set yet and it was just a bit too sweet for me after a while. I got to taste the morning glory muffin as well and it was excellent if a touch greasy.

The best part about Sunflour was that wasn't a line out the door like Amelie's. I felt like some of the non pastry options were a little expensive for what they were. For now three stars until I can return and make a more accurate assessment. Maybe their late night lineup isn't as good as during other hours?"}
{"text":"Stay away from this place!!!
The food is always good here and I do like the drip coffee, however the customer service is terrible!  Consistency terrible.  It is like they are begrudgingly doing me a favor by pouring me an over priced cup of coffee.  No \"hello\", no \"good morning\", and when I pay they show me a tablet to sign on with what tip I want to include, are you kidding me?  Then of course no \"thank you\", no \" come again\".
Well don't worry, as good as your pastries are I won't come again.  I won't pay to be treated rudely."}
{"text":"Not the friendliest service at the cash register, but the Avocado sandwich was really, really good.  The ham and gruyere toasted sandwich was also good. 
Sandwiches not served with sides."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous breakfast here. So many tempting options. Service was very friendly. Very large breakfast sandwiches and muffins."}
{"text":"Yes! I'm a fan of all the Baked goods I have tasted here!  Everything My friends, family and I have eaten here has been in the Yummy Desserts category, no serious food, wait what am I saying, I'll eat dessert for the meal(s) Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and AND I said! 

The Service is always friendly!  The Dinning area is comfortable and nice looking, though lacking Charm from my perspective!  Never seen any Cools here so it can not make my Lookalota list, yet!"}
{"text":"Quite overpriced but definitely a cute little place. The croissants are pretty amazing and it looks like they have a really good coffee and tea selection. This is the type of place I would bring friends from out of town."}
{"text":"Cheddar biscuits are my favorite, but you can't really go wrong with any of the bakery items. Paired with an iced coffee, this is my favorite Charlotte breakfast."}
{"text":"Beautiful space, great to meet friends or to grab coffee and work during the week.  The reason I am rating Sunflower three stars is I am very disappointed in the lack of gluten free offerings.  The only GF item available during my recent visit was a pumpkin cheesecake w/an almond crust.  I am allergic to nuts too so I was unable to try anything.  The cashier thought one of the scones was gluten free & vegan, but couldn't confirm with 100% certainty (and there was no sign in front of that particular item like the others).  Please consider offering a gluten free muffin and a cupcake or two.  Then I will become a frequent customer!"}
{"text":"Cute little spot to drop in for a coffee or something sweet. Love the feel when I walked in very relaxing and friendly staff. I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Heck yessss cheddar biscuits!! My husband and I stopped in for a cappuccino and a dirty chai latte (a chai latte with two shots of espresso - highly recommended) and I couldn't leave without trying a cheddar biscuit because they looked so amazing! I had a cheddar biscuit sandwich and it melted in my mouth. Each bite tasted incredibly fresh and was filled with sharp cheddar flavor. I'd happily go back often if we lived in the area."}
{"text":"Great little bakery/sandwich shop.  I had the Bacon, Egg, and Cheddar sandwich on a cheddar biscuit.   The biscuit was amazing.  The bacon, not as much.  Don't know if it's too thinly sliced or if it's healthy, but that could have been better.  Wife had the Avocado Melt with rosemary bread, and described it as delicious and fresh, which she will order again.  We split a blueberry muffin, and it was the best I've ever had, complete with solid blueberries inside.  The best part is it's in walking distance from home.  As we are just discovering the wonders of Charlotte after relocating from our native Pittsburgh, we are enjoying finding local gems such as this.  We definitely will return, despite the long lines."}
{"text":"Great products and good service - had to wait a bit today because of a lot of customers, and the barista brought me a free chocolate cookie as a result!  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"A regular breakfast stop for me on the way into town. Scones & muffins are both excellent."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are extra special due to the fresh baked bread. I had the TAB (turkey avocado bacon) on rosemary bread w basil mayo. Every bite was a delight. 

My husband had the seasonal Perfectly Peach sandwich with prosciutto and he also chose Rosemary bread. He said it was delicious. We finished with a giant cinnamon roll and a big and fresh oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. Both were worth the calories. 

Because we arrived on a Saturday after 10:30a it was busy and all the tables in the small dining area were full. We almost left, but by the time the rest of or party arrived at nearly 11a, several tables became available. 

Parking can also be an issue at Pecan shopping plaza where the restaurant is located. Lots of businesses and not enough parking."}
{"text":"I love this location whenever I'm trying to get out of the Plaza Midwood area. Nuzzled in the corner off Pecan and I love the views from the street when I'm walking here!
This location is just as good as all the other locations with their awesome Counter Culture coffee I believe, and the pastries. I love the vanilla sugar roll and anything vegan is amazing, it doesn't even taste vegan or anything off putting."}
{"text":"This place definitely has the best baked goods in Charlotte that I have found to date... and, yes, I have been looking.  Hard.  Their selections are mouth watering.  I have searched high and low for a good pain au chocolat in this town and this place has the best one.  I also tried their sticky bun (amazing!) vanilla cupcake with chocolate frosting (a little dense but enjoyable) and the best egg and cheese sandwich on whole grain that I've had. I think the prices are extremely reasonable and the staff friendly.  The lady up front said that they have the biggest selections of baked goods towards the end of the week and that it never hurts to call ahead to see what they have available if you're looking for something in particular.  I definitely recommend checking this place out.  And, chances are, you'll see me there (actually here... I'm at the Sunflour right now -- yes, free wi-fi).  

I'm debating my next order -- quiche? peanut butter and jelly scone? or cinnamon role?  Oh, but their muffins and cookies look heavenly, too!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Sunflower for about a year. The Latte's & Raspberry Poptarts are hands down my favorite. The staff is so friendly, happy and welcoming.   They just extended their food menu to include more sandwiches, which is a plus.  Would love for them to add sausage to the breakfast sandwich menu as well as add bagel options if thats possible.  Then again...I'd have to just hand over my paychecks twice a month if they did."}
{"text":"I  was there yesterday  (Sunday) with my husband decided to go to this place to have some cupcake and coffee,  oh wow I  was very disappointed with my cupcake it. I had the coconut cupcake and hubby had the beer chocolate cupcake. Both cupcakes were so cold and hard you cannot even get a fork through it. Must be old cupcake from a few days back, but the coffee was pretty good. Location is very nice . I don't think I will go back there to have cupcake."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bakery in Charlotte. I love their breakfast sandwiches and cupcakes.  Hey, cupcakes for breakfast are ok, right? :) the peanut butter cup is the best! 

On the way to the bathrooms in the back there is a huge window to watch all of the action on the kitchen.  Fun for kids to check out."}
{"text":"So Disappointed.  Sliced Ends of the Tomatoes on a sandwich?  Can you believe it?  They just have sliced the ends off both sides of the tomatoes on top of it.   Didn't even take the black spots off,  This is so Bad.  The sandwich was overcooked too.  I will never ever come back here."}
{"text":"Overpriced in my opinion, two egg and cheese sandwiches to-go ran about $15 and neither of the girls inside were particularly friendly."}
{"text":"We just really enjoyed a triple chocolate brownie (warmed up), a cheddar biscuit, and a chocolate caramel eclair. They were all delicious. The staff was friendly and the place is cute. I wish we lived closer and could go more often. Yum!"}
{"text":"Couldn't find the new Balantyne location on Yelp so here you go...
Great menu for Sandwiches and Pastries.
I stood at the counter for a few minutes while the counter person was talking to someone in the kitchen, through the pick up window. One person in our group had a Breakfast Sandwich....the bread was an average size with egg and cheddar cheese..it was on a tray/plate large enough to hold four more sandwiches.  Another person had Soup of the Day with a piece of Bread and Butter...her tray/ plate at least looked full..she had to put her spoon in the soup to get it hot enough to spread the butter, no knives? Myself and the other person had sandwiches, which again looked lost on a tray/plate large enough to hold a dinner plate, salad plate and a drink! I had the TAB...the Chutney was fresh and flavorful, the brie tasted like it was double cream but the amount of Turkey was lacking. No options for a side with the Sandwiches...no choice of Chips or Fruit or even a small cup of Pasta Salad? Most restaurants give you something with your sandwich, even Panera gives you options. I've never been thrilled about having ice for my drink dipped out of a cooler! When I asked for a cup of milk ($2.00!) for a cup of milk for my Granddaughter it took two employees to figure it out. What cup, what size and then they asked me it it was enough. It was poured out of a gallon purchased at a grocery store!   We bought some desserts before we left. Instead of the counter person getting everything I wanted out of the cases, boxing them up , and then ringing up my purchases....I had to walk back and forth between the register and the cases. Tell the person what I wanted so she could ring it up and then remind the other person what I wanted. Doesn't seem to be an efficient way to do business. If your employees haven't been properly trained, bring in good employees from your other locations until they are."}
{"text":"Great food. Went in for breakfast I ordered the number 2 (egg, spinach, roasted tomato and provolone) on sourdough. 

The bread was wonderful, panini pressed and thick. The vegetables tasted super fresh! The atmosphere is very clean and welcoming. They have lots of vegan and gluten free items (which I did not try). 

The girl that helped us was very  friendly and chatted with us while the sandwiches were prepared. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sunflour is a great spot to grab a coffee, pastry, or sandwich. The restaurant is located in an old house giving it a cozy and welcoming feel. I had an Americano and ham with gruyere panini. Both were good, but the highlight was the rosemary bread. Limited seating, but great to pick up coffee and a bite to eat to-go."}
{"text":"Our new favorite place for business meetings, I'm a big fan of the large french roast!"}
{"text":"Beautiful quaint lil bakery. Fresh with vegan choices.  Breakfast and lunches... ahhhhmazing muffins ,rolls ,croissants and cheesecake... YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Best turkey sandwich I've eaten in LiFE! The Turkey Avocado bacon on Rosemary bread AMAZING! Will be back finally a favorite restaurant in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I come here pretty frequently and honestly I have liked everything so far BUT what really sticks out are the homemade Oreos and croissants. Trust me you should come in and order those two!"}
{"text":"So yummy! Everything was wonderful. I got the spring special. A croissant with turkey, egg, basil mayo and cheese. The broccoli cream soup was delicious as was the blueberry pastry and earl grey tea."}
{"text":"As you slowly pull into the parking lot that is just big enough for Sunflour, you may notice an alien life-form: the hipster. Don't fear, they are mostly harmless. Push your way through the sea of gnarly beards, the manbuns that need clipping, and the noserings and you'll come to the counter. The menu features a small selection of coffee, pastries, and lunch items. Starbucks yuppies may feel out of place here.

Order some coffee and a pastry and have seat. Yum, that pastry tastes good. The coffee? Tastes fresh, not bitter, and certainly not the garbage served at Starbucks. As you observe your receipt for the damage, you probably notice the fair prices (for a U.S. bakery). No $10 coffee, no $5 pastry...ahh, that was great.

I will be back, and I am sure you will too. Just bring a flyswatter for the hipsters next time."}
{"text":"By far and away the BEST Croissants in all of Charlotte (It's not even close).  The coffee and espresso is also very good as they use Counter Culture premium and local coffee beans to make some great espresso drinks.  The atmosphere is lively but also simple and the location is not too bad.   This is my first time here but this is without a doubt the best bakery in the area and I will be back to review the many other creations they have here.  Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"I'm going to be super clear here: I LOVE the croissants at Sunflour and would eat them every day if that was a reasonable thing to do. If you read nothing further, here's my breakdown: Really good pastries, terrible service, and when we found glass in our food (baked into a muffin) they ignored us and never followed up. That's GLASS SHARDS IN OUR FOOD, folks.

Food Review: 5. The croissants alone qualify it for a 5. I don't even care what their other food tastes like.
Everything Else: 0. Literally ZERO. They would be better off having vending machine serving this stuff.

So the food is good. It's everything else that's wrong with this place. They are constantly understaffed and the customer flow seems designed to slow things down (those other reviews, offering to come back and give them another shot? They'll have the same experience next time as well. It's endemic). Their service is lackadaisical, takes FAR too long for the product being delivered, and in general seems more interested in being cool and hipster than actually turning their (really tasty) product. That line out the door? It could be easily solved by hiring an extra person behind the counter, reallocating staff during busy times, or simply adjusting the manner in which people pick up pre-prepared food and check out. If solid customer service was their goal, they could turn this thing around in less than a week.

Finally, there's the small matter of GLASS IN THE FOOD. This is inexcusable. We called the restaurant after finding a peanut sized chunk of glass in a \"Morning Glory\" muffin, and were told we would be contacted when a manager was free. Never heard from them. For background, if a restaurant breaks a glass in the kitchen, protocol is to throw out EVERYTHING in the area. It's just good business not to be sending folks to the hospital. We kept the muffin for a couple of weeks and finally threw it out when it became clear we had been forgotten. 

Final aside: I have a friend who loves to hang out at Sunflour and work. He's not concerned about the long wait for food while he checks email, enjoys the coffee and agrees with me that the food is really good. He also thinks that since I found glass in my meal the odds of that happening again are very low. He's so practical. So there's that."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly, the food is made fresh, and the coffee is fantastic.  Wonderful cost atmosphere and an absolutely perfect way to spend a Saturday morning.  Will DEFINITLEY be back.  Also the cupcakes are so good that I usually pick up a dozen or so for birthday celebrations throughout the year."}
{"text":"I wanted to fall in love with Sunflour so badly.  I love local bakeries, I love places that use locally sourced ingredients, and I LOVE cupcakes.  This place, based on all the Yelp reviews, seemed like the perfect place for me.  I stopped by when I was in the neighborhood, and I was so disappointed!

I tried a caramel cupcake--vanilla cake with a caramel filling and caramel icing.  And it was one of the worst cupcakes I've ever had.  It is rare that I pay $3.25 cents for a cupcake and throw half of it away, but that is exactly what I did.  The icing had a good flavor, but there wasn't a lot of it.  The carmel ribbon inside the cupcake was so thin that I only tasted it in a bite or two (and I take small bites when savoring something so sweet), and it had seemed to drip down to the bottom, where the bottom of the cupcake was soggy.  The big problem, however, was the cake.  The cake was so dense--wasn't light or fluffy at all--that I could barely eat it.  It felt like I was eating a pound cake--not a cupcake.  The flavor was okay--not too strong on the vanilla.

I think I will go back and try something else and update my review accordingly, because I honestly don't believe that I ate at the same place that all of these folks raved about.  Maybe there was just an off batch or something.

I like the idea of Sunflour so much that I had to give it to stars, but the cupcake would be 1 in my book."}
{"text":"Friendly service, very tasty sandwich (whole grain bread was a bit dry, but everything else was delicious). Enjoyable place to spend a sunny afternoon enjoying a snack or lunch!"}
{"text":"The baked items are great, sandwiches are good, wish there was a salad item on the menu. The issue I consistently have with this bakery is the lack of consistency and the amount of time it takes to order anything. The girls are always leaving the register to run and make coffee's or grab pastries so a line of 5-6 people will take around 10 minutes (just to order), if you order a sandwich it'll take around 10-15 minutes (altogether 25 minutes) you have to then walk all the way back to the register to get a spoon or napkins because sometimes they include one, but more often not. I'm always here on my 15 min lunch breaks and I never get a chance to actually eat because of how inefficient the process of ordering and receiving food is. I wish the owners would go to Sabor to see how they can move 10 people and orders in under 10 minutes. If I see a line of 6+ people I end up just leaving because it means I won't have the time to eat. The employees are friendly and wonderful but even though the location is extremely convenient and the food is good I am always trying to find more convenient options."}
{"text":"What a great addition to the Elizabeth neighborhood.  7th Street deserves a place like this!

I went in for the first time this past weekend before heading out of town.  I got an egg and cheese on sourdough for myself, an egg on cheese on multi-grain for my boyfriend, a cup of coffee, and a ginger carrot cake cupcake for the road.

The coffee was just right - strong and rich.  (Nice to have an option besides Starbucks : )  The bread used for the sandwiches was excellent.  My one \"eh\" moment ?  The cheese on the egg sandwiches seemed to be American.  When all the other ingredients are such high quality, the cheese should match.  

The cupcake an hour into the trip was AWESOME! I I couldn't get enough of the frosting, which strayed in the best of ways away from the standard carrot cake cream cheese.  This seemed to be a citrus butter creme.  The cake itself was light and moist.

I will definitely return here.  Great atmosphere.  If you're looking for a place to spend some time doing work, chatting with a friend, or just stopping in, try Sunflour. The decor is beautiful.  Very clean, elegant, calming.  And the food is tasty.  I look forward to trying their \"fig newtons\" and \"pop tarts\" in the future."}
{"text":"Spinach feta jalapeño scone, yes please. After a morning workout at the Dowd YMCA I sometimes stop for a biscuit or breakfast item drive down South Blvd. This little bakery is an easy stop for something fresh, although the limited parking could present a challenge for some during certain busy mornings. Friendly service and they often have day-old bread or other items for sale. A handful of places to sit and enjoy your coffee, but this is more of a takeout spot."}
{"text":"I am new in town and wanted to find a nice spot to have a latte and small breakfast.  Found it!

SBC has the right combo of laid back chill, good coffee, and great food. I've been there three times now and each time I've enjoyed the experience. The ladies (and one dude) behind the counter seem very competent, which is huge in my book.  Mediocre food/drinks can often be upgraded when the service is excellent.  SBC seems to have that.

One con - their wi-fi kinda sucks.

I'm going to try some other morning options...but, I'm going to feel like I'm cheating on SBC..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! All of the breads are fantastic, and are great as small gifts. The \"Pop Tarts\" are to die for and, though I have not tasted them, the wedding cakes look gorgeous."}
{"text":"There's been a lot of low key hype about SFBC and I'm so happy I finally went!

I got the TAB (turkey avocado bacon) and it was bombb!  I don't like bacon usually but I love how they prepared it.  Simple but flavorful.  My only thing was too much bread which put off the sandwich ratio.

My friend got the Brie and fig panini and wasn't happy with the ratio either-- they straight up dumped a whole jar of fig preserves on the bread.  Damn.

Other friend got the portobello melt panini which was pretty good, but could have had more flavor imo.

Overall really good lunch spot with decent sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great breakfast/lunch spot.  The sugar roll and blueberry muffins are great!  I love getting the Avocado Melt on rosemary bread.  They serve Counter Culture coffee.  I drink Decaf with soy mike and I give a big thumbs up.  Both locations are a bit small when it gets crowded - the Elizabeth location is larger."}
{"text":"Sunflour is long on charm and pretty short on efficiency. This place is not a good choice if you're a take your-coffee-and-pastry-and-go person. If you are ordering any thing other than a hot, black coffee to-go, you will have to wait. and wait.

This location is centrally located on east blvd and feels like you're walking into a home converted into a coffee shop. It's pretty tight on space but there are spacious counter-top window seating as well as regular tables. 

The pastry window is the true star and shines beautifully in displaying all of the homemade treats. The menu is written chalkboard style and covers the rest of the beverage and food options. When I walked in on a warm, Saturday morning, it was super hot and stifling in the store. There was a little bit of line but it moved pretty well. 

I ordered an iced dirty chai latte and chocolate croissant. Sunflour is pretty well-known for their croissants and there is good reason. They are huge and flaky. Perfect for sharing or not all :) I had to wait a good 5-10 minutes for my iced dirty chai latte which I found ridiculous but then soon forgave them when I tasted it. Delicious. For both of those items, my total was $8.88. Not cheap but worth it. 

While I was waiting for my drink, I noticed other people's food. I found that the egg sandwiches are made using some sort of square-ish egg patty. Personally, I would stick to only ordering pastries and not egg-based sandwiches from Sunflour. The sandwiches look pretty but I like a real egg on a breakfast sandwich.

Sunflour is a nice spot to chill on a leisurely weekend day (or weekday, if your schedule allows!) and sip and eat."}
{"text":"I drove past Sunflour many times without going in, although I always thought to myself, \"Gee, I should go in.\" Fortunately, several weeks ago, we went for the first time, and I found everything to be perfectly A-OK!

Now, I'd like to give them a better rating than A-OK. They're open fairly late, which is  alone worth major bonus points, and their baked goods are delicious. I especially recommend the magic bar. Furthermore, while they seem steadily busy, they don't get nearly as crowded as, say Amelie's does. So, why only 3 stars for Sunflour?

They stop brewing coffee at 6pm. That might seem like a petty reason to dock a star, but at least for me, coffee and dessert go hand-in-hand. Lattes are available, but who wants to drink a latte with a slice of cake? That's overkill. It seems to me that if I were open and selling dessert until 9 or 10 at night, I'd keep the coffee brewing!"}
{"text":"After overpaying for a chocolate croissant that tasted like it came straight from Publix, I went to get a cup of ice and was told I had to pay $.50.  Who charges for ice?"}
{"text":"Sunflour is a family owned bakery and cafe that makes their food on site without artificial flavorings, preservatives, dough conditioners, and bleached or bromated flour. They also adapt their menu seasonally so that they can use local produce. The original Elizabeth location has been in Charlotte since 2009 and the Dilworth location since 2016. They have a huge selection of sandwiches and confections. My favorite sandwich is their avocado melt with roasted tomato, spinach, basil and goat cheese. Their Key Lime pie is oh so smooth and the perfect amount of tart, with a nice buttery graham cracker crust. The filling is made with key lime juice sourced directly from Key West, so it is no wonder that with one spoonful I was instantly teleported back to my trips to the Keys, where the creamy consistency and natural lime flavor of their pies are unbeatable compared to those that you usually encounter outside the Keys that taste very manufactured/synthetic."}
{"text":"Let me tell you somethin!! I wish I had never found this daggone place! The cupcakes and sweets are simply irresistible! Whhyyyyyyy? LOL Homeade icecream too! And it doesn't  just look good (like some other bakeries I know) it is deelish! Definitely not the place you want to be on any type of diet. Sandwiches, wine, coffee, the works!  Quaint, cute and the staff is super friendly! Unfortunately for me and my hips...this is one of my new favorite places! SMH"}
{"text":"Love the interior of the location, super cute and friendly staff! Ordered an iced vanilla latte and it was phenomenal. Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"A fantastic bakery conveniently located in lovely Dilworth!  Close to rail trail, Atherton Mill, Uptown, and lovely tree-lined streets to get a power walk in before devouring something luscious here. Atmosphere is family-friendly with indoor and outdoor seating. 

We had the whole wheat muffin, a vegan masterpiece with berries (oh...I wanted one to go, but resisted) and a turkey egg sandwich (done in a panini press-love!) on rosemary sourdough. Bottled locally brewed Kombucha is available, and I can attest to the goodness of the cold brew. 

I'd like to work my way through this menu on a weekly basis, if my diet can handle it. Time for another power walk!"}
{"text":"If you want great coffee, breakfast or lunch sandwiches, and really great pastries/desserts, come here! 
The service is really fast and friendly. 
We love to come here in the morning for breakfast whether it's eat-in or to-go. Eating in (or on the patio seating outside) is always so peaceful and fun.
Also a big plus - they serve Counter Culture coffee...so I have no idea why you would go to the Starbucks next door when there is basically pure gold being served at Sunflour!"}
{"text":"We hosted a baby shower for our friend here today. The owner, Debbie, was okay with us hosting the shower here last minute as long as we did it after the busy hours (9-1). It started at 1pm and we did not have a problem pushing together tables to accommodate our group of 9. All of the guests were so impressed with the delicious sandwiches and especially liked the three choices of homemade bread. I also heard everyone raving about how good the coffee and french pressed tea drinks were. The staff went the extra mile to make sure we had what we wanted, and even came to our table to take our orders. We were so impressed and I will continue coming to Sunflour Bakery. The Southern BLT is a favorite of mine as well as the German Chocolate cupcake. Thanks Sunflour Baking Company for serving fresh, homemade goodies with high quality ingredients and being and allowing us to have our party at your restaurant."}
{"text":"Sandwiches might be my favorite food. So when we moved to CLT I immediately set out to find my place. I love the neighborhood feel of the SBC on East Blvd. 

The staff is always friendly.. and the sandwiches are so good! 

I personally love the TAB (turkey avocado bacon) on multigrain.

I've had soups here before and they are also quite tasty! 

My husband and I ordered a cupcake the last time we were there. It was only ok. I personally do not like filled cupcakes. 

This is my go to choice for girlfriend lunches and coffee stops. 

I'm so happy I'm moving walking distance to my favorite little sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Every time I come they are sold out of the cinnamon buns so they must be good. I do like the chocolate chip oatmeal cookies. I tried to place an order for the buns a day ahead but was not allowed to. Thought that was strange. I am never able to arrive before 3 pm. Oh well..."}
{"text":"Amazing pastries and coffee.  My new spot when I am on that side of town."}
{"text":"The quality of food here is excellent, however the customer service is severely lacking. I live in the neighborhood, and have been here more times than I can count, and every time I have a service issue. Just this morning we wanted to order a breakfast sandwich on a roll and were told we had to pick another option as they didn't want to use the rolls they were trying to sell by the half dozen. With any good retailer this wouldn't have been a question."}
{"text":"I have been looking at this place on Yelp for a few weeks now and kept telling myself that I was going to make it in. I love the location its only a few blocks from my house and easily accessible on east blvd and has a private parking lot on the side and in the back.

When I walked in the smell immediately won my heart, fresh baked bread, pastries and coffee brewing I was in heaven. They had a larger menu than I expected I knew going in they had breakfast and pastries but lunch sandwiches too? I had a vanilla latte and a egg provolone roasted tomato and spinach breakfast sandwich on rosemary olive oil bread for breakfast and it was probably the most delicious breakfast sandwich I have ever had....seriously I had to pull over on my way to work to eat it I was not able to make it all the way there it was to good to wait. 

I do have to say its a little pricey I think when I went for just coffee and the sandwich I spent about 12 bucks which is more than some of the pricier places like starbucks, but given the fresh ingredients and just general deliciousness I'm sure ill be back with no complaints.  Also they have some pretty fantastic looking coconut macaroons that have been on my mind since my first visit. I am sure ill be a regular there."}
{"text":"Stopped by on the way to church. There was a small line inside, but did not have to wait long to order. The staff was very friendly and place is small but laid out nice. Our girls ordered the cinnamon rolls-they are huge. They said they were very good. Husband and I ordered breakfast sandwiches on the cheddar biscuits. Again they were huge and very delicious. Prices are good too. Next time we are in Charlotte we will visit again."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and will return. Both times for breakfast sandwiches and a cinnamon roll. Yum! Only drawback is that it is on the pricier side for breakfast sandwiches. The place is small and sometimes moved a little slow, so be prepared to wait a few minutes if you get there during prime time"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast spot.  I love the breakfast sandwiches and the biscuits are awesome.  There is always a huge line on Saturday  and Sunday mornings, so the word is out that this place rocks. Don't forget to ask for avocado on your breakfast sammy.  They do get your order wrong sometimes, and can take a while when the line is long.  Service is the only reason they fall short of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Three times I've visited Sunflour, in only a week's time.  There are so many great things to say about it... the cupcakes are to die for (particularly the key lime, yum!) but after three visits, I'm noticing more and more \"flaws\" in the perfect bakery experience.

The Good:
-Key Lime Cupcakes
-Perfectly toasted sourdough bread on the sandwiches
-Key Lime Cupcakes!!!!!
-Some of the best egg salad I've ever had
-CUPCAKES.
-Friendly, amazing staff and patrons.

The Bad:
-OLIVES in the pimiento cheese.  The bread was perfectly toasted.  The pimieno cheese WOULD have been perfect, but there were olives in it.  I HATE OLIVES.  If you are going to put something so non-traditional in a standard like pimiento cheese, PLEASE warn the customers.  Especially when many (like me!) have olive aversions.

The Ugly:
-AMERICAN CHEESE, which is hardly CHEESE considering what it's made of (oil and god only knows what?) on the breakfast sandwich.  At a place like Sunflour, to put a slice of that disgusting product on a homemade croissant is just blasphemy.  I was so disappointed in my croissant breakfast sandwich.  First, it was american cheese, secondly, the farm fresh \"egg\" resembled... I don't even know what.  An egg mcmuffin egg is more realistic, and that's not a good sign.  Honestly, the $4.50 breakfast croissant was a huge disappointment, and hardly edible... the bread was a bit over cooked and dried out, the egg was a gross patty, and the cheese.  Oh, the cheese.  Give me real cheese.  Swiss. Cheddar.  SOMETHING. But not American.  I will be returning to my regular breakfast spots (bagels or breakfast burritos) and stick to Sunflour for lunch and cupcakes!"}
{"text":"This bakery comes up when you search for gluten free bakeries.  The only thing gluten free they had was chocolate dipped macaroons.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile now but never got around to it until a couple of days ago. I got there around 9:30am and there seems to be a good amount of people coming and going. The first time we drove right by it so be careful since the sign wasn't that big to see. 

The girls working there were a bit standoffish. Don't know if it was because it was still early and there was a constant stream of customers but they weren't that friendly and when I asked for recommendations they didn't really have much to give.     

I got the chocolate croissant and a dirty chai latte. It was ok. The dirty chai latte wasn't my favorite and the chocolate croissant had very little chocolate in it. Their sandwiches looks promising so I'll probably come back and give it another try one day."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick breakfast sandwich, here's your spot.  Not a bacon & eggs kind of place.  The eggs are pre-scrambled for the sandwiches & I wanted something fresher.  But - again- this is good for a quick pick-up.  Very nice staff.  Fast food ambiance."}
{"text":"good bakery.  great location.  was hoping for a few more Gluten free items, only things offered was mini cheesecake (which was delicious) and chocolate chip cookies.  just was hoping for more options."}
{"text":"They are so inefficient. Took an hour to order and get my order. You're better off going to Amelie's - busier but faster."}
{"text":"On way to airport I picked up Ham n Gruyere Panini on homemade Rosemary sourdoh. EXcellent. Take THAT usair. Sunflour is a happy bustling biz. Good service, smiling faces. Applause...."}
{"text":"Delicious, yet small. It was a spur of the moment stop for lunch and I'm glad I did.  I had a portabella sandwich which was to die for!!  I will be coming in again.  Just plan ahead."}
{"text":"Great spot. I live across the street and always have a great experience. Great fresh food. Tomato soup and grilled cheese was on point. Only complaint was that the soup was a little heavy on the Rosemary."}
{"text":"Now that I found out I can't eat wheat, I learned there is only one thing on the menu that is gluten-free.  Because of what this restaurant stands for, I would expect a little more.  Everything else is great though."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for a to go sandwich. Place was nearly empty. Too many other good options on East Blvd to deal with that."}
{"text":"Last night was my first visit to Sunflour and it was a pleasant one. I got the triple chocolate cupcake and it was delish! It was everything a chocolate cupcake should be - dense, fudgy and not cloyingly sweet. The staff was very friendly. I will definitely be coming here often."}
{"text":"Food is great! I mean really good, I was in town for a short period so why would I eat the same place twice when there are so many options? Because it's that damn good. I read some reviews about poor service, I didn't see any of that. Even at 7 am when we all would rather be sleeping."}
{"text":"I ordered a cake for our daughters baby shower.  It was the best cake we had ever had.  On top of that the pastries and cheddar biscuits are to die for!"}
{"text":"Bday today and knew we were going to eat thru the day, so right after getting our chompers cleaned at the dentist, I wanted to start with a nice breakfasty type item and selected a scone.  Let me tell you, even with a quasi \"scope\" taste in my mouth, this scone ROCKED!   Crispy flakey crust on the bottom and delicious through out...I'm a fan now!"}
{"text":"Wow, this might be my new favorite hang out spot in Charlotte. Excellent baked goods, Counter Culture coffee, friendly service and fairly minimalist decor? LOVE IT.

I visited for the first time today for a late breakfast and a bit of working on the go. I enjoyed a café au lait and a croissant. Oh man, that croissant. They're one of the few (if not the only) bakeries to make their own croissants from scratch. (Amelie's sells Sysco croissants!?) Boy can you tell. Super flaky, airy and buttery, it tasted just like it came out of a corner boulangerie in Paris.

Sunflour Bakery, you won my heart.

PS - If you need to use the wi-fi, just ask an employee for the password."}
{"text":"This place is a joke.  The carrot cake was repulsive and made me want to throw up in my mouth.  The chocolate souffle wasn't much better.

  I recommend some cooking classes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Working as much as I do, you need good food options. And you need them in close proximity. I'm fortunate to have 3 occupations, within half a mile of this place. The service and products, couldn't be much finer. I've had just about everything they make. Excluding some of their panini's. Which I'm sure there awesome. Just haven't made it past their croissants and giant cheddar biscuits. And they do a mean blueberry muffin. Everyone I introduce to them, are instant addicts. If you care about your waist line, join a gym like 9Round Dilworth to justify your visits. Did I mention the do cupcakes & custom cakes too!! My best friend recently married the love of his life. Somehow, they had 10 wedding cakes....yep you read that right. Four of the camera were dozens of custom cupcakes. And the remaining 6, were all different flavors. Each more delicious than the last. So, in short I'm thankful that they're close by. But I'm gonna need to ramp up my marathon training, and use more of these carbs #mooremoves"}
{"text":"I just had to upgrade my review because I've been finding myself coming here more and more. They have garnered a trifecta of awesome from me.

They have THE best croissants that I have ever had in my life. They are both fluffy and crispy, due to their three-day fermentation process (hey, it works for beer, so why not pastry?) and 27 layers of buttery goodness. Just writing this reviews makes me wish it were breakfast so I could get one with egg, bacon, and cheese.

They also house my favorite cake/cupcake of all time (their caramel). The beauty is in how it is not over-sweetened and perfectly frosted. The moist density of the cake is amazing.

Rounding out the trifecta is the fleur de Sel cookie with its truly masterful combination of dark chocolate and sea salt. There are simply no words. Get it!

As a tip, you can call ahead and order to bypass the line during busy times.!"}
{"text":"CUPCAKES is pretty much all I have to say here. They have good coffee and lots of other menu items that I haven't had. Though, the other day I had a chocolate croissant and it was probably the best one I've had in awhile. Picture proof below."}
{"text":"Blue Berry Muffin!
So good I had another."}
{"text":"I had a club sammy on a croissant with avocado. Seriously one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. On the flakiest croissant. It wasn't cheap but it was huge. When it was brought to my table, the lady said \"I hope you're hungry.\" I told her I'd take 1/2 home. I ate the whole thing it was so good. There goes that healthy living diet I've been on 
PS. I'm going to ruin the diet some more by getting some sweets to go. Guess I'm going to the gym tomorrow too. Oh and they were playing good music too."}
{"text":"I love the coffee here! Also the sandwiches and baked goods are clearly made with such care. The anti Panera if you will. Homemade soups and breads. I love this place. great place to meet friends or read a book and have lunch alone. 

Pro Tip: Order the Pure Intensions coffee. Its locally roasted and the freshest!"}
{"text":"Almond croissant is perfect! Crunchy outside, soft layers inside, with not too much almond paste."}
{"text":"I strolled in here on a Saturday morning after a long walk with the dog.  To my surprise, this place was packed with neighborhood peeps standing in line for their coffee and breakfast sandwiches/pastries.  I decided to join in on the fun.

The good thing about long lines is that it gives you plenty of time to figure out what you want to order.  I decided on a ham, egg and cheese on a croissant.  The sandwich was huge and yes, I ate the whole thing.  It was really good, but I am pretty sure they are using imitation eggs and I would have preferred real eggs.  I ordered a regular coffee, which was good and did the job.  I sipped on my beverage while I waited a whopping 15 minutes for my food.  They warned me when I got to the register, so it wasn't a shock when I decided to place my order.

Here's what I'm ordering next time.  For sure, I'm getting one of their pastries.  They looked amazing and there was this blueberry treat that someone was eating at the table next to me...I was so close to just tearing off a piece to try, but thanks self control.  They also serve FRENCH PRESS COFFEE!!!  Individual or large sizes.  I got my order to-go, but if I stay to eat next time, I'm trying it.  Also, in no way to I eat anything vegan, but they do have options for those who are looking for some vegan treats.

I'll certainly be back.  It's the perfect place to stroll out of bed and head down the street to a neighborhood joint where people won't judge you in your sweatpants.  Might be hard to get a table when it's packed, but wait a few min and someone will get up.  See you soon, Sunflower!"}
{"text":"I'm a little mixed about this place.  There are definitely some good things and some not-so-good things.

Let's start with the good.  French Press Coffee.  They have a single cup, or a 2-3 cup press to share.  The coffee is pretty darn good.  I've had their regular coffee and it's OK.  There are so few places that offer French Press, so big bonus for Sunflour.  Also, their Croissants and biscuits are excellent.  I had the Cheddar Sausage Biscuit which tasted good, but it probably would have been better warm.  Also, they have a lot of great choices at the bar where you make your coffee, like honey sweetener for your iced coffee.  Pretty cool!

The disappointing part was the rest of the food.  So the regular coffee as I mentioned is OK.  Their breakfast sandwiches come on a nice croissant, but if they are busy, you could wait a while for your sandwich to come.  they also use fake egg product, so you're not getting a real egg on the sandwich.  I also do not love their cupcakes.  They look beautiful, but they have always looked better than they tasted.

Overall, pretty good breakfast spot if you're looking to overload on carbs.  Parking can be a bit crazy, so I recommend going early to get a spot."}
{"text":"The Sunflour Baking Company never disappoints! Their food has always been amazing and fresh. I tried a \"coffee in a cone\" and it was as tasty as it looks! The cone is covered in chocolate so even after you've finished your coffee, you get to finish the cone!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast and both got breakfast sandwiches, one on a croissant and the other on a cheddar biscuit. They were both great! The bakery items are huge, so we had to take our blueberry muffin to go since we were so full after the sandwiches. Would definitely recommend for a larger breakfast!"}
{"text":"Cute adorable bakery. Great for a coffee with a friend, or if you are in search for an apple turnover or a cinnamon bun the size of your face.  Service is friendly, but DREADFULLY slow. There is always just one person taking orders and one cooking. I have stopped here on my way to work and it takes about 15 mins to get your sandwich if you walk in with no wait."}
{"text":"Mmm. This place is a gem. The breakfast sandwiches, cupcakes, and other goodies are great, but the macaroons really take the cake! They knock Amelie's out of the water. They're huge (!) and delicious. The pistachio one is a favorite of mine, although they're all great. This place can be super busy with long lines, or pretty empty depending on the time of day. If you go towards the end of the day, you'll most likely have limited choices (which is to be expected). Indoor and outdoor seating, good atmosphere, and the staff is always friendly!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I really enjoyed my bacon egg and cheese biscuit. The cheddar cheese biscuit had a great crumble in your mouth texture and the bacon was delicious. I do think the eggs were average at best as I'm not sure they scrambled fresh eggs for the biscuit. We also ordered a tuna salad panini which I thought was a pretty small portion for the price. The tuna panini was rather mediocre and I felt that I could probably make a tuna panini just as good from my groceries."}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped in for a late lunch.  I had tried their cookies before. ...which are incredible. ...but this was the first time getting a sandwich.  Oh my! SO GOOD! Fresh ingredients on fresh baked bread. 
I will be back again!"}
{"text":"This is a new place that just opened up and I must say I am a huge fan!


The place

Located in the a plaza they call the Quad it is in a really nice plaza in town with lets of shops around it.  The inside is really nice.  They have a good amount of tables plus a high bar top.  Very well done and the bathrooms are clean.

The food

I had a Bacon egg and cheese on a Croissant.  Can I say WOW!!! One of the best breakfast sandwiches  I have ever had.  I really wish I wasn't so full so I could have tried many of there amazing looking baked goods. I will be back to try them sometime.  The only reason they didnt get a five star is due to my french press I ordered was luke warm.  There is nothing worse than luke warm coffee.  

The verdict

This place is nothing short of awesome I loved going here and I can not wait to come back to try  some of the lunch options and baked goods!"}
{"text":"The location is a little out of the way in a small strip mall with limited parking but worth it! The Almond croissant is perfect! Crunchy outside, soft layers inside, with not too much almond paste and a light amount of sugar on it.  I also had a bacon egg and cheese on a Croissant and had really good flavor.  One thing I was really impressed with was the latte I had. I honestly didn't expect the it to be good. Whatever espresso they use was had great flavor!  They used a great blend of white chocolate with it.  So many places turn a latte in a syrup drink which I hate so props to these guys!  My only complaint was the service wasn't great the kids working there forget part of our order and really didn't seem to know much of anything.  I plan on going back when I am back in town for sure!"}
{"text":"The almond torte tho.....only if you want epicness. This is the place to be. Super cute for people watching and getting that local feel, love this place!"}
{"text":"Sunflower is such a great little bakery. I stopped in after a weekend workout (obviously) and grabbed the bacon egg and cheese on a cheddar biscuit and a cinnamon bun. They had so many other delicious baked goods in the case that I'll have to come back for. The staff was friendly and despite being busy, got everyone in and out quickly. I also got a large iced coffee which was really good. I'm typically super picky with iced coffee but this one was dark and smooth. The cheddar biscuit was pretty awesome. It's large and cheesy and goes well with the rest of the sandwich. The cinnamon bun was a real treat. The frosting isn't too sweet and almost has a cream cheese flavor to it? Maybe? Either way it's delicious and is so big that I shared it with my husband over the course of the weekend. I can't wait to come back to try more of the sandwiches and sweets."}
{"text":"I was disappointed. I am not going to lie. I do live in Plaza Midwood and have been going to that location for awhile. However, my work is in Dilworth. Doing nothing but raves, I did get some of my staff members together and we went to Sunflour to get something sweet. I am always one to talk this place up.

 The environment in Dilworth is not as warm as it is in PM. I did notice  an older woman with a bun running around to different tables, working hard, but her face said other, She almost seemed bothered that there was \"business\". 

I will say that yes, I did get confused about the buy 1 get 1 Magic bar. 

The problem is - those were the day old ones, in comparison to the fresh ones. I did change my mind, and opted for the fresh one. 

When the cashier rang me up, the lady, almost slid the prepackaged \"Magic Bar\" my way. The cashier said, \"no, she wanted one out of the case\". The lady w/ the bun said, \"you didnt get her order right?\" the cashier said,\"no, she changed her mind\" and the lady repeated it \"OH she changed HER mind\". I did. I changed my mind. I am very sorry that you had to open the case and put a fresh one in wrapping. I am sorry that changed my mind. I do not know what to say, and it was so uncomfortable that even the cashier gave me a look. 

My co worker was snarled at for adding in a \"flavor\" shot to her coffee, after she was rung up. 
We will pay for whatever difference. Geez, we are very sorry. 

I will stick to Plaza Midwood location only. Hopefully, it will continue to stay sweet and lovely. Or, maybe, I should just make my own at home."}
{"text":"I really look this place. It's a nice chill spot. If your in a rush this is not the place to go unless you call in your ahead of time. The had wooden tables. Staff is friendly. Good is REALLY GOOD! I not had the cupcake.... yet anyway I will tho'."}
{"text":"I love this bakery but the customer is practically invisible for them. Last time I went after dreaming of the cupcakes, nobody acknowledged me for 20 minutes. I had to walk away and it seemed like nobody cared. Awful customer service."}
{"text":"I'm bumping my stars up to a five because the multigrain bread I picked up today may actually be the best loaf of bread I've ever bought in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Combining two of the hottest trends in in food right now- artisan baking and local sourcing of ingredients, it seems like Sunflour ought to hit the mark.  In my opinion, it sure does.

This sunny shop is just around the corner from my house, so I had a stop in the other morning for a little breakfast.  Light colored wood tabletops and counters contrast with large photos of fresh foods bursting with color.  You get the concept right away, even without having to read a word- I like that.  A chalkboard overhead and behind the counter tells of that days freshest offerings along with a little info on which of the ingredients are locally made and where the come from.

Breakfast options abound with decadent-looking croissants, plain or chocolate.  There were also a number of muffins and loaf slices.  I opted, though, for an egg sandwich on sliced house-made bread.  You could also opt for a biscuit, but the thought of sesame-semolina bread sounded more interesting to me.  

I had to wait for them to make the sandwich, which I didn't mind since it meant I was getting a pre-shaped egg patty that worked its way thru the microwave at some earlier hour.  While I waited, I looked at the many pies and cakes that were making their way out of the kitchen and into the cooler.  I also noticed that they brew Counter Culture coffee and espresso.  Figuring that I'd give Starbucks a break, I had a mocha latte.  Wow was I impressed- their mocha sauce is made in house and it was perfect- not too sweet but not too bland.  No burnt flavor, as some have noticed in the 'Bucks.  Once that was made, my sandwich was also ready I went on my way.

Before leaving, I noticed they also serve a number of deli lunch sandwiches too.  Most sounded really good- banana and nutella?!  Yum.  Ham and gruyere with whole grain mustard?!  Double yum. 

I understand they also do wedding cakes- hopefully the wife and I are beyond needing those, but the custom-ordered pies and line of breads coming soon sound like they are worth investigating.   

Can't wait to go back- this is a most welcome addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I'll admit it, I kind of forgot we had this. I recently moved to this side of town though and I was on my way to Starbucks one day when it caught my eye. Oh yeah! Sadly it was Monday and they were closed, but I made a mental note to come back another day. So one sunny morning (or, as some people like to call it, late afternoon) I took myself out for some breakfast. 

I'm all for supporting local, and it paid off because my scone was delicious. I had to stop myself from ordering one of everything, but the giant muffins are definitely on my To-Eat list. The coffee was eh, ok, but considering it was like 4 pm I can let that one slide. It wasn't horrible, just wasn't a fresh pot. (I know, 4 pm. Some of us drink coffee then.)

If I could change anything, I would swap out some tables for a few more couches. The little couch section looked so homey, but sadly they were all taken. 

This is just walking distance from my new digs, and I'll be bribing myself with treats after a walk in the future."}
{"text":"I've never had anything bad here! This time I ordered the Pimento Cheese & Tomato Grilled Panini (White and yellow cheddar with roasted red  peppers topped with tomato) on sourdough (you can pick your own bread!). It was perfect. The boyfriend similarly ordered the grilled cheese which was basically a simplified version of mine (Cheddar, provolone and tomato). I tried his too and it was also really good! My friends ordered the Fig & Brie Panini and the Avocado Melt and both looked amazing. I've had the Avocado Melt before and enjoyed it very much. Fig & Brie is next on the list!

The pastries are also excellent! Get a cheddar biscuit as a side. You won't regret it. 

The atmosphere here is also very chill. Order at the counter and then find open seating. There are some outdoor tables available and then the cafe has bar seats along their windows as well as tables for parties of various sizes. That being said, it's a small place, so don't come with more than like 6 people and expect to find a place to sit.

Saturdays are less busy than Sundays."}
{"text":"Great lattes, delicious croissants, and huge breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in their second day in business at this location. What a breath of fresh air. Friendly service, fresh and hot coffee, and a menu that gives you options without being overwhelming. 

I ordered an egg n cheese on a croissant, plus added tomato for $0.50. It could have been the fact that I had finished up a long run, and was very hungry, but I think it was one of the tastiest egg sandwiches I've ever had. The croissant was perfectly flaky, the egg was seasoned just right, and the tomato tasted super fresh for the time of year. 

My friend ordered the same but with ham; his sentiments echo mine. We shared a French press which wasn't the best French press I've ever had, but it did the trick (definitely think I'll try a more speciality-type drink next time). 

I eyeballed the pastries but didn't try one. I hope to do that soon but as of right now, I can't comment on that aspect of the business. 

Our order did take a long-ish time to come out but like I said, it was their second day in business; there's bound to be some hiccups to work out. 

I'll definitely be back here again. I liked the 7th street location and I'm very glad to have this one now, which is a little closer to my house."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee shop in town. I had a delicious caramel latte and sandwich today. On a cold day, it's the perfect place to warm up in a bright, friendly atmosphere. Always love getting a pastry here! Really helpful and friendly staff. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The ham egg and cheese sandwich was okay. I wasn't expecting egg that was liquid and steamed. But the chia oh the chia I ordered was Luke warm I asked the girl can she make it again and once again she rushed and didn't take her time in preparing my hot drink cuz it was chilled once again. I threw it away and went to kenth cafe for a   A+ chia latta w/ caramel. Hot btw"}
{"text":"I am rating based on a sandwich, not pastries. I ordered Black Friday which has turkey. I asked what type of turkey they use and was told Carolina... I am particular about turkey but since this seems like an upscale bakery, I figured it must be good. It was awful - it looked and tasted very processed. 

When I looked up Carolina Turkey I read they bought or merged with Butterball in 2006... if this is truly the brand, no wonder the quality is low. 

Here's some info but it it contains disturbing info about animal abuse.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterball

How surprising a restaurant that seems pretty nice would not make their own turkey breast, or buy meat from a smaller, ethical producer for taste, health and ethics.

I look forward to trying some pastries I bought for breakfast, if I can get that nasty turkey off my mind."}
{"text":"Holy moly! How have I never been here before?! I came here last Saturday morning to grab a quick coffee and a bite to eat. As I get here, the line was out the door (always a good sign). I was super intrigued by all the different things I could order and really struggled to make up my mind. 

I ended up getting a ham, egg and cheese on a croissant. It was unbelievably good. Coffee was delicious as well and it was nice a hot. I appreciate things like that - I hate adding cream to my coffee and all of a sudden my coffee is room temperature....know what I mean? I also couldn't resist and ended up getting a chocolate peanut butter cupcake..I inhaled that thing. Can't even describe how good it was.  

Can't wait to come back and try a few other items that caught my eye.
If you're in the area,make sure you check this place out!"}
{"text":"Such a great little cafe and bakery!

You absolutely can't go here without trying the Macha Green Tea latte.... I don't drink coffee, and generally I don't drink tea, but this drink is amazing! They make it so creamy and delicious, it's worth getting even on a hot day.

The blueberry croissant (really more like an open tartlet), the cheddar biscuit with basically anything on it, the Avocado melt, and the Ham & Gruyere croissant are all delicious, and are \"must-haves\" in my humble opinion.

Don't plan on coming here at peak hours for Saturday/Sunday brunch, or you'll be standing in line a looooong time ---- insider tip is to check it out for a late mid-afternoon lunch, or go really early on a Saturday. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Love every single thing I have ever eaten here. Their sweet offerings and their savory items are all incredible. They now have two locations but they are both packed. Make sure you do your best to go during off hours but totally worth it, even if you have to get things to go because there are no seats."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the variety this place has to offer and the environment was amazing as well. I loved the oatmeal pie and the whoopie pies, along with the quiche Lorraine. I plan on going back to try several more of their baked goods, as well. I could easily see this place becoming a hangout."}
{"text":"This place is great, I love their breakfast sandwiches (one of the best croissants I've ever had) and their cupcakes are very moist and dense which I love. They also serve counter culture coffee which I'm a big fan of. The service is a little slow sometimes, but they are very precise and always get my orders right... It's become a regular spot for me. :)"}
{"text":"I happened to see this place driving to midtown and am always attracted to family-owned and/or non-chain locations. I was extremely impressed with the website, the vegan options, and the fact that they donate their unsold goods to charity. Can't go wrong with that, so I was happy to patronize.

SBC is situated in a quiet and scenic part of Charlotte, neighbored by other trendy and fairly new restaurants in that area. We visited on Sunday morning, and I opted for the dark chocolate macaron and a chai latte. The macaron? Absolute perfection! It was creamy, pillowy, slightly crunchy, and the chocolate just melted in your mouth. The latte was good decent--what one expects from a chai latte.

I then had the fig, brie, and apple sandwich. I was really excited to try this as I've made a similar version at home that was good. With professionals making it, I knew it would be superb.

I wasn't thrilled. 

Brie was a bit too mild and subtle to pair well with the sweetness of the fig jam. A sharper, more pungent cheese would be a better option so you're really getting the combination of sweet and savory. I was little shocked at the price tag too. In all we had the following: two sandwiches, a latte, an Izze, a macaron, and a muffin. Total? $29.99. That seems a bit much. Now give me a dozen macarons? I'll gladly pay that much, but it seemed a bit pricey for what we ordered. I could be wrong though. I'm not holding that against them.

My only other complaint is the preparation of the sandwiches. While I was waiting for my order, I noticed that the preparer was handling food with his bare hands. This was extremely off-putting, and I nearly said something but was discouraged. If there is one thing I don't like it's someone handling my food without gloves. Yes, I know, it probably happens all the time in restaurants I visit and never see it, but the difference was I DID see it. I tweeted my discontent on April 13 in the hopes that they might change this, but I haven't gotten a response. I'm not angry--I just think it's a better way to do business. 

Will I go back? YOU BETCHA. The staff was brilliant--big smiles and happy faces, so I can definitely see this becoming my new Sunday morning spot to bring my friends to."}
{"text":"Plenty of parking here since it's attached to a shopping complex. Lots of windows and a decent amount of table style seating. Some bar style seating too facing the windows. Only one table that seats four on the back patio. Not much to see back there, but plenty of traffic to hear since a busy road is just a few feet from it. Cheery decor with cheery paintings of flowers. Place was very clean. Bathrooms one at a time gender specific. Spacious, modern, and clean. Staff were attentive and genuine. 

I've been to all the Sunflour locations in the area and I thought the baked goods section here was smaller than other locations. Still plenty to choose from though. Anything from cookies to muffins to small tarts and dessert bars. Also a full sandwich menu and a soup of the day option. 

Lots of coffee options here as well as tea and some canned San Pellegrinos. I went with a caramel soy latte. Pretty darn pricey at $5.60, but it did come in a ceramic mug. Tasted all right, but not worth the price. I paired it with an excellent vegan chocolate chip banana muffin. Good size for $3.25! 

I'd stop in again if I find myself in the Ballantyne area."}
{"text":"Lots of good things going on for this place. Lots of places to park in the back, Lots of windows. Lots of seating although none of it the lounging type. staff are receptive and friendly.   two unisex bathrooms that are cheery and big and clean. vegan muffins are freaking outstanding! full of flavor and moistness and quite large!

So let's talk coffee. coffee is either drip or personal french press. got the french press and it was a little burnt tasting. may be a grinder problem or maybe the water was too hot. diluting it with half and half actually made it better. got a soy caramel latte one other time and that was dynamite! creamy and good balance of caramel and coffee. 

Coffee may not be perfect, but I'm still coming back!"}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly to me and they seem to really care about their job. I do like the bright interior and the music selection they play over the sound system.  I admire the fact that they try to provide food that is local and organic because it is consistently fresh and absolutely good. My favorite  is the egg salad sandwich on multi-grain bread. The pastries are also a winner and wonderfully fresh, BUT my favorite thing about Sunflour is the coffee! Absolutely and consistently fresh. My favorite drink is the caramel soy latte. Double thumbs up for homemade syrups (vanilla, caramel, and chocolate)! The only minor complaint that I have is that it's not a place to \"nest\". The seating here is stiff and sparse. Just tables spread out in a square or bar-like seating facing the window which doesn't always work out because the sun is slamming you in the face.  Definitely need some oversized chairs or couches in here. Sometimes you just want to hideaway with your coffee and not be outwardly seen."}
{"text":"Really delicious, quality pastries. Came here for breakfast and shared the cinnamon roll, hazelnut Orange roll, and chocolate croissant...all excellent!"}
{"text":"My husband loves the Chocolate chip cookie- said it was one of the best he had! I had the gluten free pecan bar it was good just a little undercooked tasting. Busy on a Saturday morning- can't wait to go back to try more. For a cookie and a pecan bar it was 5.95. Got it to go as it was packed."}
{"text":"They were very busy when we stopped by for an afternoon snack and coffee, but service was still pretty quick. I appreciate that they had a few vegan choices. One of us had the vegan raspberry muffin and said it was excellent, moist and flavorful. I shared a very large cinnamon roll with another family member and we both enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Amazing food, super friendly staff, beautiful location... I love this bakery!

The first time I went in here I had a banana and Nutella sandwich on multigrain and it was so so good. The staff were pleasant and quick with my order.

There were lots of desserts to choose from too- I caved and went with this double chocolate chip cookie. It was the perfect texture and had a slight hint of salt to really balance the delectable chocolate flavor.

They have lots of coffee drinks too with a description of their roasts. That's a good sign. Their hours are a little limited, thats my only disappointment.

I'll definitely be back and will be spreading the word about this place!"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried at Sunflour has been really good. I can tell they're using high quality ingredients and take pride in their baking. BUT, the prices seem a little high. Pastries are fairly reasonable -- $3-$4 for a really good scone, same for a cupcake, etc. Lunch was were I felt a tad ripped off. I had the avocado melt and my mom had the ham and gruyere. (Both were pretty tasty, for what it's worth. My avocado melt could have used a little salt or seasoning.) The total was almost $20! For two sandwiches. No drinks. No sides. I mean, for $20 throw me a pickle or a handful of chips or something! The tray looked as bare as my wallet."}
{"text":"I was honestly shocked to see so many four and five star reviews, I must be more of a stickler for customer service than most. Service is always slow slow slow. Slow when the bakery is full, slow when the bakery is empty. I've been on several occasions and have never received an order in less than 20-25 minutes, even for just a biscuit with avocado. The staff appears stressed or ULTRA casual depending on the day, but there's never a sense of urgency whatsoever, that I've witnessed. Part of good customer service is providing your guest with what they need in a reasonable amount of time- never happened here. 
However- every single thing I've ever ordered has been delicious. Pastries, cheddar biscuit, sandwiches. I will continue to visit Sunflour but only when I know I have an hour to spend, never when I am hangry, and always with the knowledge that I will be waiting on my food for a long time. Coffee is okay. 
I think with some restructuring and better management they could turn things around. Get some professional help, guys. Underwhelming service and long ticket times are going to hurt your business, if they haven't already. There are other bakeries I choose to solicit over Sunflour because i know they'll hit all my marks. 
food- five stars
service- one star"}
{"text":"Coffee was delicious and strong. Breakfast sandwiches are large and filling. I got the egg, cheese and avocado on croissant and it was delicious. And huge! Croissant was soft and flaky and it was very flavorful. Reasonable prices. Cute quiet cafe atmosphere. I would return."}
{"text":"I used to live right down the street from here and I am sad to say I moved a bit further where I cannot frequent as much anymore but this place is by far the best bakery in Charlotte! The owner is the sweetest and the staff goes out of their way to remember your order that you made a month ago!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The staff is always so helpful and the drinks and food are always made with great quality ingeridents."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've stopped in Sunflour Baking Company. They recently changed ownership, spruced up the place, and expanded their hours (they're open on Monday now!) I've always been impressed with the friendly folks working here and their delicious lattes (chai latte - yum!) and pastries (Guinness Stout Cupcake - wow!), and sandwiches (anything made on a cheddar biscuit or croissant!). All of those things have remained impressive with the new team.

My minor gripe is the wait. I don't want to knock them too much since they're making everything fresh when you order, but it's not a place I can count on to get in & out of quickly. So if you've got a few extra minutes in your day, be sure to visit the new & improved Sunflour Bakery."}
{"text":"I'm really glad this place is on East Blvd.  There seems to be a shortage of breakfast places/options in the Dilworth/Southend area that results in hour long waits for weekend brunch/breakfast outings.

This place is double duty since it's a bakery, but they offer savory or sweet in terms of breakfast.  Now it's not an \"all out\" breakfast, but I believe their breakfast sandwiches are made on site with carefully chosen, fresh ingredients that support local produce vendors and farms.  They offer organic coffee and teas - cakes, cupcakes, sheet cakes, and various desserts and treats.  I didn't try their sandwiches, but they looked pretty awesome.

Came here after playing tennis on a Sunday morning, the crowd wasn't too bad and there was a line (ordering at the counter), but the employees were friendly and made sure to warn us how long the wait would be after ordering (just 10min).  We were able to sit outside (along with some furry friends that accompanied their owners to breakfast/coffee that day).  Inside there was a handful of tables and also bar seating along the window so you can watch cars and pedestrian traffic traverse East Blvd on a nice Sunday morning (or whenever you decide to visit).

Breakfast Sandwich #4:  Egg, Bacon & Cheddar on a Cheddar biscuit was my order, and I quickly gobbled it up.  I did have to take a breather since the biscuit (and I saw their croissants) are ginormous... so pace yourself.  Even spoiled myself and tried one of their oreo cookies... I have a weakness for oreos to begin with, but this was like one giant oreo!

Will definitely be back to try their other offerings or even just get a beverage and hang out with a book.  I can walk here which is a big plus for me, but it appears there is plenty of street parking along the side-streets in Dilworth."}
{"text":"Food was decent but prices were too high and service took a while. 

With so many brunch options in town, I have a hard time finding myself wanting to urgently go back here."}
{"text":"Sunflour Baking Company puts Amelie's French Bakery to shame. I used to think Amelie's in NoDa was as good as it gets for pastries in Charlotte. After discovering Sunflour, I realized I couldn't have gotten it more wrong. 9 our ten times, when you pick up your muffins, scones, and croissants,  they are still warm from the oven. That's how fresh they are. They have hit the nail on the head in every aspect. They aren't just fresh, they're delicious. Super sized cinnamon rolls smothered in cream cheese icing, vanilla sugar croissant dough rolls, chocolate chip scones, and that's just the beginning. They have authentic latte's and tons of cakes and deserts. This place place makes me forget all that is wrong with the world."}
{"text":"Everything I've ever had has been good!  It's so nice to have a truly professional bakery here."}
{"text":"I truly love this place even though its a drive for me. I love how they use Counter Culture coffee beans, their treats are yummy & their breakfast menu has a variety of options. Granted the place can get crowded because its small but its a treat to always try something new here. The staff is patience and helpful and the atmosphere is laid back. Definitely a place to hang out or meetup."}
{"text":"Things I would order again - 
* Croissant - Expensive at $3.75 apiece compared to $1.99-$2.50 from the local competitors, but they are larger in size than the competition in the area and MUCH better tasting.  Sunflour has the best croissants in Charlotte as compared to Amelie's, Earl's Grocery, Renaissance Pastisserie, etc.
* Blueberry Croissant Square
* Nutella Pop Tart
* Blueberry Muffin
* Cheese biscuits alone and not as a sandwich

Things I would not order again - 
* Cappuccino - Go to Not Just Coffee inside the Atherton Mill around the corner and down the street instead.  Sunflour's capuccino is inconsistent.
* Mixed Berry Scone - Not enough berries
* Cheese biscuits as part of a breakfast sandwich.  Would use a sourdough or bagel for these sandwiches instead.
* Cupcakes, but maybe because I got one on a Sunday it tasted a day or two old.  Yes, when I buy cupcakes I expect fresh baked.  If I wanted day or two old, I would bake them myself on the weekend and eat during the week.

Things I don't like about this place - 
* Unless you get there first thing in the morning, the dining room is gross with crumbs all over the tables and chairs.  Even the outside tables are covered in other peoples food.  They either need to provide customers with wipes so we can wipe our own tables before sitting down or they need to get their employees out from behind the counter and at the very least clean the tables.
* Not a fan of being asked to add a tip every time I order.  Yes, the food gets delivered to my table, but I go and get my water, I bus my own table, there is no one coming up to us and asking if we want anything else, and because the tables are not wiped down I bring my own wipes in my purse or backpack.  I give tips to true waiters and waitresses.
* Additional note that the above two issues can be said for many restaurants, but I expect the places I frequent to be better than every other place I could do business with.  I mean why doesn't Sunflour make the same crappy croissants that everyone else makes?  Because they choose not to.  I'd like them to care for cleanliness in the dining room and outdoor spaces they use just as much as they care about the product they make."}
{"text":"I love having Sunflour close by and I always take friends who are visiting from out of town. It is pricey, but it is yummy! I'd rather pay more and be happy about it than go to Panera and always be disappointed.

My favorite breakfast is egg and cheese on a cheddar biscuit and a cup of their regular coffee. I got the yellow birthday cupcake with chocolate icing on my birthday with their rewards program and it was absolutely delicious. 

We got two small Funfetti cheesecakes for my brother's birthday and they were as yummy as you'd expect! I salivate just thinking about them.

I would go here more often, but I'm really trying not to start the habit of getting a pastry everyday. Having this place close by makes it hard not to start that though!"}
{"text":"I've made it my mission to try all the bakeries in Charlotte, and Sunflour is the one that is consistently fantastic. I've never had any baked goods I didn't absolutely love there. And now they have a shop literally a scone's through from my house? Danger.

In the past I've been drawn to their muffins and sticky buns, which are fantastic. Ditto for the cupcakes. The caramel cake was so good... The slice was so big I could hardly finish it, and I don't say that often. (I haven't been able to try the famous cheese biscuits because they are always sold out by the time get there.) I will say, the coffee is not to my liking because it's dark roast, but I won't hold that against them.

But all of that goes out the window when you try a croissant. Oh, the croissants. They are flaky, buttery perfection. And they are huge. So y'all can keep buying the cheddar biscuits and leave the croissants for me."}
{"text":"Gave this place a couple of tries. The food I had was very bland and the wait time was too much and the dining area was uncomfortably crowded."}
{"text":"Stumbling in to this delicious haven of bread, cookies, and cupcakes was dangerous for my wasteline...but a treat none-the-less! 

I had several bites of many things -

Chocolate Chip Cookies with Walnuts - So tasty almost Zebbs good ( a hometown favorite of mine- if you're ever near Upstate NY find these treasures!) 


Cupcakes in order from best to least:

Strawberry- Light and perfect for summer 
Rolo (as in the hershey's candy! yummmmm)
Guinness- I liked this one but we agreed it really did not taste like Guinness at all ...just chocolate with vanilla icing 
Mimosa- awesome concept ..not sure if I tasted the champagne in the frosting. 

But actually the real prize should go to the homemade crusty bread. We had the rosemary Olive Oil (used for two bruschetta-esqe rescipes). I will be getting myself some black pepper cheddar next time."}
{"text":"I keep running by this spot that is just a block or two off the light rail. I finally decided to try it out! I didn't go for the apparently famous breakfast to try the #2 biscuit, but I cannot wait to come back to try it! I had a vegan cupcake; vegan baked anything is incredibly challenging. The cupcake was very good! Their coffee was delicious, and I was able to set my laptop up, study, and enjoy the view of East Blvd. This is such a walkable, adorable, and beautiful spot in Dilworth/South End. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"We thought the restaurant was overpriced for breakfast sandwiches.  It was $20 for two coffees and two sandwiches that didn't come with a side.  

It seems like we might have ordered the wrong thing because most people were going in for sweets. (Cinnamon rolls, etc)

Wife has egg cheese and avocado on sourdough and husband had egg bacon and cheese on sourdough.  The eggs were pre made.  (Ew)

The bread was the only good part of the sandwich.   It took about 15 minutes to get our food which was a long time for pre made eggs.  

We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Pimiento Cheese Sandwich!  They're awesome.  The lattes are pretty good, and as you would imagine, the pastries and breads are amazing.  I had some kind of mocha stout cupcake also.  It was light in texture while super rich in flavor.  I barely finished it, but had to so I could also sample my giant chocolate chip cookie!  It was pretty good, too.

They also use organic flour which is nice to see and support many local farmers and food purveyors including Counter Culture Coffee, Lindley Mills, and Charlotte Very Local Honey.

Awesome place!  Go there!"}
{"text":"I want to like Sunflour, and if you look at the name and the bakery case as a piece of modern furniture, and maybe - just maybe - the cool blackboard-ish menu, then I probably do like it.  But then you look at the contents of the bakery case, rather than seeing it as an admirer from afar, and I get all antsy because I really see very little that excites me.

If you watch How I Met Your Mother, it is much like stated by Barnabus Stinson in the Cheerleader Effect: Get a bunch of semi-decent looking stuff (women, or baked goods) together, and as a group they all look better/hotter (paraphrasing here).  Once you look closer, however, they all look quite a bit rougher.

Luckily, Sunflour has no pastries that look like Marshall Eriksen.

Regardless, the selection is decent, if not great.  And the food is decent, if not great.  I just find myself wishing that it was better, while at the same time I am glad that it is not better because I could totally see being there more often."}
{"text":"Our visit here was underwhelming. We got a cupcake and a cheesecake. Both were okay but not great. I'd say this place was just average."}
{"text":"Overall, this place was ok. I parked right up front. I saw their display but I didn't know if people were waiting in line or just looking at things and not deciding yet. I waited a bit. It was finally my turn and I decided to go with the peanut butter cookie that was chocolate dipped, one chocolate cupcake from the day before that was half off and one vanilla cupcake to go. I paid for my items and the girl didn't even offer to bag my stuff even though it would be hard to carry. I asked for a bag and she bagged it. I got home and tried the items later that night. My husband liked the cookie but wasn't crazy about the flavor of the chocolate. The chocolate cupcake was good and surprisingly pretty moist since it was a day old. I didn't like the vanilla cupcake. The texture was very similar to a pound cake. It was thick and dry. I also didn't like the frosting to go with it. Overall, it was an ok experience but it won't stop me from going back and trying something else."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. Sent an email about a situation - no response. Treated as if we were bothering them when we entered with a small group (12 girls) from our school at 11:30 on a Thursday.  Sandwhich maker was rude, I apologized and was just brushed off. Too bad. Won't be going back for this reason. They've also mixed up my orders before, but the food was decent so I didn't mind. Not paying this much for poor service, though.

UPDATE: Was able to communicate with owner who apologized."}
{"text":"I prefer their other location. Stopped in on Friday afternoon for a sweet after lunch at Luna's and there wasn't much to choose from. I settled on the tiramisu since which should be named something else. It has a hard chocolate frosting on top which doesn't give under pressure. The place was empty and the cases were lacking. Embarrassing considering I had talked the place up to my out of town guest."}
{"text":"I have only ever enjoyed a cup of coffee here but I will admit I love coming here for a work meeting. They serve Counter Culture Coffee, which comes from Durham, and it may be one of my favorites. I am strange and do not drink caffeine so I usually order decaf - I remember I couldn't order my usual decaf drink so I had to order an Iced Americano but it was still delicious. 

Once I try their food I'll let you know! :)"}
{"text":"Sunflour is one of those little gems that you don't want to miss if you're visiting Charlotte. This bright, inviting shop has a great variety of baked goods on offer, along with breakfast sandwiches and coffee and tea beverages. Food is ordered at the counter and you receive a number to place at your table so the server can find you when it's ready.

Their croissants are incredibly flaky and buttery and stand on their own or complement their hearty breakfast sandwich options. We enjoyed their egg, cheddar and ham sandwiches this way.  The blueberry croissant has a generous portion of fruit laid atop all of the flaky goodness. Scones are not overly sweet and have an excellent texture as well.  The coffee and chai tea lattes are top notch and go well with the food items.

This place looks like it stays busy, with a mix of diners and laptop users filling the tables. Parking could get a bit tight here with all of the traffic but it is worth the trouble to find a spot to visit this cafe. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Oh my stars another delicious bakery! Thank goodness, because God forbid I have to travel a mile outside of Elizabeth to fetch a delicious treat. 

I was really intrigued by Sunflour as soon as I read that they were opening. It's a (pun intended) sunny bakery filled with tasty treats, coffee, a smattering of tables and smiling faces. Right now they are focusing on their baked goods, but in time expect to see them crank out artisan breads and gourmet sandwiches, too. 

On my first visit I went with a recommendation, one of their special baked goods of the day - a pumpkin whoppee pie. ZOMG. Two delicate, flavorful and delicious pumpkin cake-muffin-hybrid sandwiched with a generous layer of cream cheese frosting goodness. It was fabulous. I also enjoyed a decaf vanilla latte that was oh so frothy. Yum.

One of my favorite things about Sunflour, though, is that they focus on using local & regional ingredients. On their website, their menus and their chalkboards they tell the customers where their flour, eggs and coffee all come from. With these amazing baked goods, eager to please staff and charming nature, Sunflour may be one of my new faves in Elizabeth."}
{"text":"Cheddar biscuits and homemade poptarts. I could very easily just stop the review right there and say, \"you're welcome.\"

This place is super adorable. A place to grab coffee, breakfast, lunch, have a meeting, get some work done or pick up a delicious sweet treat. There is just something so soothing about sitting down and enjoying a little pot of tea. It's my out-of-the-yoga-studio zen moment. On the flip side, their cold brew is a huge rush of caffeine that will keep you going for hours. I drink a ton of coffee, but man that cold brew makes me bounce off the walls.

Need something to take to a party? Grab a loaf of Sunflour's Rosemary Olive Oil bread, a whole pie or some cupcakes.

I have a really hard time straying away from the cheddar biscuits here. They are great plain or as a breakfast sandwich. I'm also a big fan of the fig jam and brie sandwich. Although, I'm pretty sure I would eat a piece of cardboard if it had brie on it. 

Service can be a little slow at times. I think that just goes with the laid back, casual atmosphere. The parking lot isn't huge, so you may have trouble finding a spot during lunch time at this shopping center."}
{"text":"YUM! I made my first in-store visit to Sunflour this past weekend and really enjoyed it. Overall, I think they provide a wonderfully chill option to the plethora of overpriced brunch places in Charlotte.

I had their fig and brie panini, which I highly recommend. I also couldn't leave without trying one of their baked goods, and the raspberry chocolate cupcake I had was literally one of the best cupcakes I've ever tasted. The cake was thick and moist and the raspberry icing actually tasted like *gasp* raspberries instead of just loads of sugar.

Only complaint is there isn't much space or seating. It's quite popular and people were having to bunch/crowd/bump into each other when trying to order and getting a table is definitely not guaranteed. Wish there were less people camped out with laptops doing work like they were in Starbucks. Some of us want to enjoy good food at a lovely cafe."}
{"text":"I liked the place.  Chocolate croissant was very good, even though the exterior wasn't very bubbly looking, the taste was there."}
{"text":"I think this photo says it all!! Cute place in Charlotte off of East Blvd. Truly delish breakfast biscuit sandwich. Avocado is extra, but worth it. Tons of good coffee options to boot!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places that opened up a few years ago.  They offer wonderful delights such as various types of cupcakes, macaroons, mousses, cheesecake, muffins and cinnamon rolls.  They also offer lunch and breakfast goodies like paninis and croissants with meats or cheeses and usually a soup of the day.  Open 7-7 most days.  They also take orders for cakes.  Ive had one and it was delishious."}
{"text":"I am at this joint just about every weekend in the AM and it still has yet to disappoint.  The baked goods are some of the best I've ever had! The croissants literally taste like you bought it in France and the cupcakes, dinner rolls and other pastries are just as superb! It's an extra treat when they bring out the season for the pumpkin Apple muffins! This place is a real bakery. If you want a decent cup of coffee and a great baked good, look no further! Reminder: baked goods=awesome! Sandwiches=not the first place I'd think to eat. Other than this...definitely try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Croissants melt in your mouth. Also ordered the avocado melt on a cheddar cheese biscuit..delicious. I couldn't finish the whole thing but it was rich and tasty. I'd come back, especially for the croissants!"}
{"text":"The Dirty Chai Latte is amazing! So yummy. Better still are the employees. So polite and kind. Definitely a great place to grab a bite to eat and/or relax."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Charlotte, hands down. They have amazing coffee, pastries and breakfast sandwiches. You must get the cinnamon roll (it is huge so split it with someone) but is amazing. Ask for it warmed up and it will come out to you at the perfect temp. The icing has an amazing cream cheese flavor and you will want to lick the plate.

After you devour the cinnamon roll, opt for some protein and get a breakfast sandwich. You are missing out if you do not get it on the cheddar biscuit - it is life changing. I used to get it on multigrain bread and it is good, but the cheddar biscuit is on another level. It has the perfect amount of crispy outside and soft inside. I highly recommend the cheddar biscuit with egg, cheddar, bacon and add avocado (it is worth it).

Coffee is also great, I love their cold brew! Definitely try Sunflower, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I stopped for coffee a few weeks ago, and ever since have been dying to go back for a breakfast sandwich. I woke up early this morning and decided today was the day to make it happen. I popped over around 8:30am, and found the place busy, but not yet totally packed. The line moves quickly, and I ordered coffee and a ham, egg, & cheddar on croissant. After I sat down, the line started to grow. I'd say this place is a pretty popular weekend morning spot. Anyway, sandwich came fairly quickly and really hit the spot. Croissant was huge and flaky (but a bit greasy), and the cheese was really tasty. Ham and eggs pretty standard. It was a filling sandwich. 

I would give five starts, except that I didn't see a sausage option on the menu, and there was something sticky on my table. I will definitely be back for the chocolate croissant soon. They're with a visit!"}
{"text":"Third time I have been and they have been out of croissants.  I was told this morning that they were at capacity and if I wanted one I should call in the morning and reserve one.  Who has time to do that?  Maybe they should invest in a larger oven since they are a bakery."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches wish chips were included.  very friendly staff very nice bakery and good pastries"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with the baked goods that I purchased. Vegan raspberry tart and a blueberry cinnamon bread pudding. They looked very appetizing, but each was average, at best. 

The tart was bland on many accounts, the crust, the filling...I could barely taste the raspberry. 

The bread pudding was unfortunately too dense and cold. I could appreciate room temperature but it was cold, cold. The denseness made it hard for me to pass the fork through the pudding. No bread pudding I've ever has been so hard to pass a fork through or served cold not warmed. 

I applaud the cute workspace and sitting area. They have a good variety, but I'm afraid to try more at the expense of it not being good."}
{"text":"Oh where oh where do I even begin?

The smell? The decour? The deliciousness that awaits? The display of sinfully-bad-but-you-gotta-try-em-pastries that stare at you as you walk in? 

I go weak in the knees every time I walk into SBC and it's both a blessing and a curse that this establishment is located a few blocks from my front door. I have no self-control when it comes to fresh out the oven muffins or brownies so good the taste stays with you all day. 

Perhaps one of my favorite new spots in Elizabeth, SBC boasts organic produce from around the area and makes muffins, sandwiches, poptarts, cupcakes and other delectables that are just a pure treat for the tongue. I'm not over-exaggerating at all. 

I hit this place up every weekend for their breakfast sandwich which I get on a fresh cheddar biscuit. There are always people hanging out in here and everyone walks out that place with a huge smile on their dial. I've tried just about everything (brownies, cupcakes, poptarts, granola, muffins, ham and cheese croissants, cinnamon buns, the list goes on). 

They're open Tuesday-Sunday and an absolute MUST STOP if you are living in or visiting the Elizabeth area. At first I tried to hide this place from others but apparently word go out."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place. We have been going to Sunflour since it first opened and our daughter worked there several years ago. The ingredients are top notch and they serve delicious sandwiches, pastries and coffee drinks and more. We love their special twist on a BLT, which is especially good on their homemade butter rolls. The lattes have been consistently perfect; the blondie cupcakes taste like the best pound cake ever, and are topped off with wonderfully creamy cream cheese frosting.  We love this East Blvd. location too..."}
{"text":"For any of you who may have stopped coming to Sunflour (for whatever reason) there is no longer a reason.  The atmosphere is cozy and clean, the employees are helpful and seem HAPPY, and my personal favorite (other than the AMAZING pastries ---which, by the way, have always been the case here) THEY ARE NOW OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK!!!  I no longer have to come on a Monday (which for some reason was so often when I seemed to want pastry???) only to find it closed!!!  Also, I really love the customer contact and appreciation venues.  Those who used to come and stopped and you who have never come here....this is THE BEST BAKERY IN CHARLOTTE!!!  And I take my pastry very seriously because I don't spend those calories without careful consideration...."}
{"text":"I chose Sunflour after searching yelp for vegan dessert options in Charlotte. I was meeting a friend for coffee and thought it would be a great place to have options that fit both of our diets. 

I ended up ordering the vegan banana chocolate chip muffin and he opted for one of their butter breads gussied up with avocado, pimento cheese and tomato.  We both ordered their teas to drink. I had the tangerine ginger. 

The vegan muffin was absolutely fabulous. So good in fact, that I thought to myself,  \"Is this really vegan?\" Even though all the signage said so and it was the only banana chocolate chip muffin that they served. If you order this be sure to have it warmed up. I did and I think it made all the difference. I'm also not a fan of the cold muffin anyway  so I could be a bit biased. The chocolate chips were perfectly gooey and the muffin was deliciously moist and pillowy. It had the perfect ratio of banana to chocolate just like a good banana bread. Which is something that I've missed first to due to my tree nut allergy an then to my vegan diet. But this glorious muffin made up for it all.  

The tangerine Ginger tea was super refreshing. I'm a huge fan of ginger and thought it had the perfect amount of ginger in it. Love that they served it in its own mini glass pot with a glass of ice to pour it over. 

Best of all was the service! The staff was friendly and knowledgeable and able to speak to the availability of vegan options and provide spot on suggestions! This will definitely be a place I regularly visit. So glad to have found it! Thanks yelpers!!!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best bakery in Charlotte. They hand make the croissants every day.... No stale baked goods. The almond croissant is SO good! We came two days in a row. The restaurant venue in Dilworth is so beautiful. The staff is extremely friendly. The coffee is so good. I've had their drip coffee and their latte with almond milk. I also had the cinnamon roll... Couldn't say no to it when I saw them bring it fresh out of the oven. I've had the breakfast sandwich with the cheddar biscuit... That is delicious too!"}
{"text":"Higher end place to stop for a quick breakfast. Food was great and the coffee was amazing. I got a small french pressed coffee and it was great. Free wifi is a plus. Staff was extremely helpful and nice."}
{"text":"Where has this place been all my life. Sunflour bakery is definitely going to \"put a crimp\" in my supposed gluten-free lifestyle.  We went because a friend of ours got a job there and we wanted to check it out and support him in his new state of employment.  

Housed in a nondescript strip shopping center in the Elizabeth neighborhood, the interior was very pleasing, comfortable, and unpretentious.  There was just the right amount of hustle and bustle to make things seem busy and cheerful without being overpowering.  Nothing too cute or faux shabby chic about this place, just perfect baked goods and coffee.

Unless you regularly travel to Paris, this is the place you need to go for the best croissant you have ever taken into your mouth.  We had the ham and Gruyere, and a chocolate one for dessert.  I only have one word...wow.  Flaky, crispy, buttery and heavenly.  They are not to be missed.  Coffee was superb and the cappuccino was perfectly prepared, rich, dark espresso with a magnificent thick head of expertly frothed milk.  

We took a slice of carrot cake to go and ate it later at home.  It didn't disappoint either.  very moist, not too sweet, and obviously made with stellar, fresh ingredients and lots of love for their customers.  I can't wait to go back and \"blow\" my diet out of the water next weekend."}
{"text":"Quality coffee, clean atmosphere, wifi, and FANTASTIC baked goods. It's a little on the pricey side, but that hasn't stopped me from coming here for the vanilla sugar roll as often as I can."}
{"text":"Ok...I don't know why I continue to come back here. So sad this AM by my watery chai latte. Seriously? $4 for watery thin chai tea. I'm very disappointed and upset that I wasted my money.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"We were introduced to this charming, bustling café while visiting friends in Charlotte. 

The breakfast sandwiches are perfection. Each starts with fluffy eggs, cooked in a square mold so there are no under/over done areas - just a perfect even egg. Additional toppings include cheese, avocado, and a several meats. You can choose from a variety of tasty breads, but obviously the cheddar biscuit is the best choice - flaky, cheesy, buttery, and substantial enough to support all the toppings you could want.

We also tried the pumpkin apple muffin, which is like eating Autumn (a good thing). The coffee is strong and full-bodied, and with a splash of almond milk completes any breakfast.

My only regret is that there isn't a Sunflour closer to me."}
{"text":"I got the Avocado Melt. It was good, but very small.  Especially for an $8 sandwich.  The iced coffee is bitter tasting.  I'm mad at myself for paying $12 for essentially a snack. I went next door to the Chinese Restaurant afterwards and paid half that for twice the food."}
{"text":"We're moving up in the gastroworld! We finally have a boutique bakery!!

Tiffany's meets croissants and cupcakes. It would almost be too cute to handle but their pastries are rad, I have confidence that they know what they're doing with bread (which they aren't selling yet, but soon, soon) and they do egg and cheese in the morning. For cheap.

Petit Fours would make the most sense, but they also do Fake fig newtons, pop tarts, oreos, that fancy Nabisco thing that's hit bigger towns so hard. The sip-sized coffee is nice - sometimes you just want a half cup, ya?

Unfortunately, this is where they fail a bit. I've had scorched, I've had too thin - I have not had a cup that rivaled Julia's, Central, or even Smelly Cat. Sadface. Hopefully this will improve - at close to 2 bucks, you need to show your brew some TLC and appease us snobs.

Decor is airy, clean, modern, lovely, kind of vast for a bakery, and being able to peep into the back kitchen's an awesome touch. Sweetness."}
{"text":"I had a slice of cake from here for an office party. As soon as I bit into the cake I just had to ask where the cake was purchased from. Rich, moist cake and a not too thick layer of creamy vanilla frosting. Fantastic; far better than cake I've had from other popular bakeries in Charlotte. Can't wait to try a cupcake from here! Only downside is that their treats are on the pricier side, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome bakery that definitely satisfied my sweet tooth. Their bananna cream pie was delicious! The worst part about Sunflour Baking Co. is the inability to decide what to get..."}
{"text":"I wished the tuna Panini had more tuna in it it was very thin and I wish it had more flavors, $8 plus, for this after tax and tip. I thought it was overpriced for what it was. The cheesy biscuit tasted delicious. Wish we tried some of the pastries too."}
{"text":"A charming little bakery with excellent baked sandwiches, pastries, and coffees. Definitely on the hipster side of things, which is not really my scene, but I can blend. It is also a little expensive for what you are getting, but the food is good.  It's a nice place."}
{"text":"Always good food and decent coffee, but the \"Michael Buble Radio\" has got to go. I get that they are going for the relaxed coffee shop vibe, but it doesn't work. Regardless of the genre though, the music always seems a bit too loud for how small it is in there, especially if you're reading or trying to get work done."}
{"text":"Great coffee and sandwiches ! Tastes amazing. I love coming here, it's nice and quiet, very nice inside, great environment."}
{"text":"I love their coffee, baked goods. One of my favorites in the Charlotte."}
{"text":"I'm going to give sunflower five stars because I don't see a reason why not to. I've only been there once and split a breakfast sandwich with my wife. The food is really good and the service was fast and friendly as well."}
{"text":"What an awesome place! We love the cheddar biscuit sandwich - so much so that when they are out of it (which they often are by mid-day), I choose to go elsewhere. Their lattes are always good. Another item that is often sold out is the nutella pop tart. If you are lucky enough to get one, ask for it warmed up and fall in love! So, so, so good. While it is a little pricey (Panera type costs), it's always good and the rewards program helps with discounts and deals."}
{"text":"This bakery is close to my house and I was craving sweets so wala I tried this place. I got a vanilla cupcake with buttercream icing. It was good for what it was but not the taste I was looking for. It tasted like a pound cake with icing. I was going for the that Cake taste. It was very sweet and it had white chocolate chips on top which was really good. I'll have to try something else next time and service was overall good."}
{"text":"Their cheddar biscuit.. Was huge hard and dry. Maybe I need to go earlier in the day?

Their French macaron was sweet but hit the spot! First off, it's huge! Then unexpectedly there is a delicious filling oozing in the middle! Enjoyed every single bite!"}
{"text":"Went here with the family.  Not a cheese lover so I ordered a bacon & egg sandwich no cheese.  Took quite a while to get - and it had cheese.  Sent it back.  Waitress arrives with a totally different sandwich so I wait again for the correct order.  Disappointed when I it arrives - bacon comes out of a microwave package, paper thin, flat & tasteless.  Bread not toasted enough.  Coffee had a horrible taste as well.  Most of the rating goes to the poor service."}
{"text":"Seriously delish.  Biscuits as big as your head. Hubs had a ham and cheese on sourdough, I had egg ham and cheese on a giant biscuit.  Worth a trip."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live about 1/2 a mile from the Sunflour Baking location in Dilworth. He has picked up breakfast to go for us multiple times, and I've enjoyed it. Yesterday, I went into the Dilworth location with him for the first time. 

I loved the 1/2 off day old pastries - great idea! Also, their croissants are large and fluffy - yum! 

The outdoor area needs a good cleaning. Our outdoor table was dirty and sticky, and at 9 am on a Sunday morning there was a good bit of trash scattered about on the ground. Our food took about 20 minutes to come out, and when it did my boyfriend's order was wrong. Rather than taking his meal back to the kitchen to add the cheese and avocado he'd requested and been charged extra for, they said they'd just bring those 2 items out on the side. This seemed odd but we said ok. It took another 7 minutes for the cheese and avocado to come out. By this point I was well into my breakfast and his breakfast was now cold, which was disappointing. We also overheard the table behind us, and their order was incorrect as well.

Hopefully we just caught them on an off day. The food was good, but the service and overall cleanliness of the restaurant was not up to par during our visit."}
{"text":"2 words that will change your life....CHEDDAR BISCUIT....the biscuit is a 5 for sure.
This is what you go to Sunflour for. I found their sandwiches to be quite mediocre (at least at the 7th street spot). But the cheddar biscuit is what lured me here in the first place and what keeps me coming back. They do have great house made vegan soups that change daily, but don't for a second fool yourself in to thinking that you are going to be able to eat a soup and an entire cheddar biscuit breakfast sandwich. Not gonna happen. Trust. I've tried. 

So let me tell you a little bit about what you are getting in to. A biscuit with bits of cheddar baked in, crispy and brown on the outside and soft and airy on the inside. Get it with egg, cheese (yes more.) bacon, roasted tomato, some spinach, and avocado, or any combination of those things. I do wish they did a little something better with the egg though. Its more like a slab of egg custard than substantial egg most of the time. Kind of a texture bummer. But the whole sandwich is great regardless. 

Be forewarned though. These puppies sell out. ESPECIALLY on weekends. The 7th street location is almost always out by noon any day of the week I've called. Not sure why they don't realize that and just make more daily. Anyways, East Blvd has a heftier supply of them. Even though the 7th street location is MUCH closer to my house, I found myself going to the East Blvd location instead for this reason. The staff is also extremely friendly at this one. The atmosphere is a bit better on 7th though. Either location, expect to find kids....lots of kids."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic!!! Everything my friend and I ordered was beyond delectable. Stared at the desserts secretly wishing I was still hungry enough to purchase one!! Highly recommend ordering the mint tea- they give you a large portion (had enough for 3 full cups). Definitely planning on returning again."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. We were expecting fresh, tasty sandwiches, but had to return them...The stuff is friendly and the coffee was good, but that you can get at Starbucks...Tons of unhealthy sugar coatings on the cupcakes. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Emailed them about s vegan carrot cake,they got right back to me communication was great cake was to die for very good quality for vegan cake! Thank you"}
{"text":"I came to this place as part of the Good Eats & Meets Foodie Crawl last night. Our stops were Kennedy's, Château D'ough (not open to the public) and Sunflour. When we first stepped in I wasn't impressed by the décor and the IKEA looking furniture/cabinets they had.

The first thing I noticed the nice selection of craft beer they had, so immediately things were looking up for me since it was around 10:30PM. Their wine, tea and coffee selections are really good too. Part of the Crawl included a behind the scenes tour of the bakery. IMPRESSIVE! Their large kitchen is fantastic and they had a string of treats for us to try.

First we had some sample of random chocolate little treats which were all delicious. The cheesecake brownies were out of this world. Then we got a nice spiel on their Croissants. I wasn't a big Croissant fan... until now. Apparently they are the ONLY bakery in the Charlotte area and one of the few in the entire Southeast to make their Croissants from scratch... which is a three day process. We had their dark-chocolate-filled Croissants and I was hooked.

Their standard coffee, which is all I had, was excellent. It was a nice medium roast, very smooth and silky.

I also love the fact that, whenever possible, they support local businesses and farms. I love that!

I've been to Nova and Amelie's and all those places... they're good. Sunflour, blows them right out of the water. I am a fan!"}
{"text":"I love this new location near my house! My boyfriend and I went for lunch today, and it was lovely. We had the portobello mushroom Panini and the avocado melt. They were both excellent! We also shared a bowl of their red pepper soup, which was a great accompaniment to the sandwiches. I had a chai tea latte as well, which really hit the spot! 

The new space is walkable to many local businesses, so I believe they will get more busy as people realize they are now here. I can't wait to go for breakfast or for a cupcake snack. Everything in their baked goods case looked excellent! I will be back very soon, and I will likely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Sunflour has been my little go-to the last three days with a fam member in the hospital. We all know you can't get good food in those places! One has to venture out! So I ventured here. 

I love the vibe, the staff of super friendly ladies every time I have been in, and I love that they have vegan muffins! And delicious ones at that!! I mean perfection, \"are you sure this is vegan?\" type! They also have a very nice selection of breakfast sandwiches, though I cannot have any, my sisters have had them. They are large and filling, great flavor combos from traditional to creative. Lots of pastries to get your AM going and a good selection of coffee and organic teas! (Almond and soy milk available-again, yay!) 

Sunflour is in a great location for a lot of businesses and hospital employees to run to, but also families from the neighborhoods surrounding it. So keep that in mind and be patient if they get busy! Bit of a hot spot in the prime AM and lunch hours. On the other hand, during slower hours, I've seen people getting some work done on laptops and slowly getting their day started. 

As a vegan, lunch is not much of an option here for me, but I will keep them as a favorite for a good coffee and vegan pastry! Everyone give them a try. :)"}
{"text":"Came here because my boyfriend's friends work here. I got the avocado melt which was pretty good! I also bought a vanilla cheesecake and matcha macaron for my mom and friend. They both thought they were really good. We also shared the coconut oolong tea and it was heavenly. If you like coconut you would like this. It smells strongly of coconut which I liked but the taste was faint and not overpowering the tea."}
{"text":"I'm just not as enamored with Sunflour as I feel like I should be. It's nothing that they've done wrong, and maybe I'm ordering the wrong things, I don't know...

I've been here twice now, and the location is wonderful, the ambiance is exactly what I think of for a perfect brunch/breakfast, and they have an outdoor patio that's inviting to dogs and families that faces East Blvd. I just don't think I enjoy the food as much as my company does. 

So far I've stuck with their paninis, which have been alright. Last time I was there I got the Grilled Cheese, and it was just a little bit underwhelming? I don't know. I want to love this place, because I love everything else about it. I just can't justify 4 or 5 stars for somewhere I'm 'meh' about their food. 

If anybody has any suggestions of what I should try next time to redeem my experience, I'm totally open to trying out new stuff! Let me know, I want to love Sunflour!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars for its baked goods, but the service is SO BAD! I waited 25 minutes to pick up an order I had phoned ahead to arrange simply because they can't manage order lines. I really really want to love this place but every time the frustration with the service completely overwhelms their products. It's the absolute worst. So frustrating."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for my sandwich which I never received. Checked on my order three times to be told they were first \"looking for me\" (I was standing near registers with number in hand) and then it'll be right out twice. When I said third time I had been waiting 30 minutes and couldn't wait any more the answer was \"oh\". I left without sandwich and with no refund. I know things happen but just tell me not let me stand for 30 minutes for something that should have taken under 10. I won't be back due to
poor customer service."}
{"text":"I go here a bit too much. They have a rewards program for free baked goods or 50% off pastries. It's a bit pricey but most of their desserts are excellent.

The outstanding: key lime tart. Simply delicious. The perfect combination of sweet and tart. Perfect custard and delicious buttery graham cracker crust.
Almond torte: rich and almondy and great texture. Heavenly.
Carmel cupcake: this is one of my favorite cupcakes. Not too sweet but a rich caramel flavor 
Expresso bacon cupcake: they don't have this flavor a lot but get it when they do. Perfect combination of sweet and savory and fat. Sinful 
Almond croissant: it's the size of a small child's head. Rich, buttery , flakey goodness 
Butter roll: I use it as a bun for sandwich after toasting. Great with griuere cheese, pesto or avocado 
Caramel cheesecake: divine. Creamy, rich, sweet but not overly so. Rich graham cracker crust. Yum! 
Lemon bar: rich buttery shortcake with tart lemon curd. Amazing ! 
Earl grey cookie: it's delicious, buttery but not too sweet with a hint of earl grey

The good: tiramisu , raspberry cupcake , basil blueberry cheesecake , carrot cupcake, coconut macaroon 

The okay:dirty mocha-- didn't have much mocha flavor 
Nutella cupcake. I love Nutella but this was too sweet. 

The not good: hazelnut orange bun. Not much hazelnut or orange flavor. Kinda stale 
Matcha scone. Dry and no matcha flavor 

They have half price on day old pastries."}
{"text":"I love the coffee drinks here. The breakfast sandwiches are amazing. The lunch sandwiches are amazing. The atmosphere is perfect for hanging out and getting work done. Oh, and the coconut green tea is really good, too. Love it here and glad they have two locations!"}
{"text":"A friend and I popped in one night and shared 4 desserts...yes 4. :) Everything had a yummy...give me more taste, and the staff was super friendly and helpful with descriptions of the items."}
{"text":"Very nice little place for lunch. fresh and tasty and a nice iced tea"}
{"text":"My husband and I typically go to Nova's Bakery once a weekend.  For a change of pace, I suggested that we try Sunflour.
Not a lot of charm in this strip mall shop.  However, we were greeted with smiles and gentle dispositions.  I love the sign that says, \"unattended children will be given espresso and a free puppy.\"  But, this did not stop the running and screaming of two chaps as their adoring grandparents looked on.
We got the cheddar cheese biscuits.  Yummmmm-eee!  My husband claims to be a scone tasting expert and loves the dense texture of Nova's, so he tried a chocolate chip scone from Sunflour.  The consistency was more like a sweet biscuit from one of the fast food joints.
I ordered a decaf coffee and was pleasantly surprised to get a latte.  I don't know if it was caffeinated or not, but it was so good that I wasn't complaining.
This place had tables and chairs on the sidewalk so that we could escape the espresso filled, runner-screamer children.  I hope that their grandparents read this review and get a hint!
Nice change of pace from our usual haunt."}
{"text":"Was disappointed overall.  The one in elizabeth is better.  The sugar cookie was hard, the macaroons were stale and the Nutella cupcake tasted like coffee. I love the other location so not sure what went wro ng here.  Even the presentation of baked goods was sub par.  Hope they work out the kinks!"}
{"text":"Finally made my way over to sunflour baking company!  My motivation was their cupakes but the fact that they are known for making everything from scratch and use only the finest, freshest ingredients was certainly an added incentive.

I tried the egg salad sandwich which was on homemade bread.  The bread was really what made this sandwich so tasty.  The egg salad itself was truthfully a little bland.  I wouldn't order it again.

My friend tried the bacon egg and cheese and was very pleased.  

the cupcake I tried was ROLO.  It was a dark chocolate cupcake with a dark chocolate buttercream and a rolo melted in on the top.  It was VERY good, but super rich.  It was bitter and had a heavy cocoa flavor.  The caramel from the rolo cut the bitterness a little but this cupcake would never be accused of being too sweet.  The cake part was so moist it was almost wet.  It was phenomenal.  The icing was extremely creamy and almost melted off the cupcake.   I found out they use all dark chocolate/bittersweet chips for their baking to keep things a bit healthier.  I can certainly appreciate that and I think had I known that beforehand I would have known what to expect from the flavor.  It was unique in a lot of ways.  It was a dense and heavy cupcake but very good and I look forward to trying some of their other flavors!

4 stars.  I think they are a little overpriced and there aren't a ton of menu items.  I didn't think the crew behind the counter was very friendly either so I wasn't impressed from that point of view.


I probably wouldn't come back for a sandwich but I will be back for more cupcake exploring."}
{"text":"Sinful and heavenly at the same time! The treats in this place are amazing. Stopped in because it's my director's favorite spot for gluten-free treats and we are celebrating her promotion. 
Small and quaint, it's a really cute place to have a morning pastry, coffee and chat with a friend. Be warned, pets are allowed outside. So if you're afraid of dogs like I am, walking in can be tricky

Parking in the front can be dicey; parallel parking on busy East Blvd can take skill. But rest assured, there's a decent-sized lot in the back. 

The cashier was helpful in helping me locate the gluten-free items. I eyed the ENORMOUS cinnamon bun that was the size of a small child's head. That's on my list for next time!"}
{"text":"I had no clue there was a twin to my East Blvd location!

When you walk in, the sweet smell blankets you. It's so hard to choose a pastry from this place that always has something new, different and delicious. 

Today, I'm meeting a new contact so I didn't want to be eating. I settled on a white peach blossom tea. Oh my goodness. Peach deliciousness in a cup. You can have it hot or iced. This surprise 80 degree in Charlotte warranted having it cold. So refreshing while sitting outside and seeing the sites of this up and coming area. 

But when you come, don't do what I did today. Have a pastry. They are divine. That cinnamon roll...."}
{"text":"Slow service, lost the ticket to my order. Waitress was the only good thing about this place. Will give it another shot though. Homemade Oreo is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Ode to a Sunflour Bakery

Wake me up -
Coffee in my cup -
See a muffin or a cinnamon roll and they're both bigger than my coffee cup! 
Vegetarian options galore -
Make my tummy happy and my head soar! 

Guys! Sunflour Baking Company is cleverly named with a little pun to make them extra fun. If you haven't been to Sunflour yet, there's no reason to delay your trip!"}
{"text":"I was in town to meet a friend and we stopped in here for a bite to eat. 

The ambience is great but the space is somewhat small and the tables were somewhat close. We ordered our food and our food and coffee came out fairly fast. I order a coffee and the Black Friday panning to eat on whole grain. It came out and was warm and tasted divine! It was like thanksgiving dinner on a sandwich and had turkey, brie, house made cranberry apple chutney. My friend got the avocado melton rosemary bread and it was yummy too but I didn't think there was much avocado on it. Overall it was good, but not a huge WOW. The cupcakes did look great but I did not have one. I reminded me of a smaller Panera. I will be back to at-least try a cupcake :)"}
{"text":"Super cute place. The atmosphere is quaint, good place to grab a coffee of a sandwich when meeting friends for a quick lunch. Only downside- it's popular and not that big inside so seating can get cramped. 
The toasted sandwiches are delicious- really like the Avocado melt (usually get bacon on it) and the southern BLT. And you cannot go wrong with any of the baked good :) 
I am a HUGE fan of the cupcakes, not overly huge, so I don't feel like I'm getting diabetes when I eat one, but it still sates my sweet tooth. 

Perfect little neighborhood coffee shop."}
{"text":"Cute space to work in, a large selection of baked goods, friendly staff, and an awesome vegan banana chocolate chip muffin. Seriously, I had my doubts when my friend raved about this muffin at Sunflour, but it lived up to the hype. I love that they have a selection of other vegan items too. Oh, and there is a nice patio!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a bit to get a cookie and use up some of their wifi. It's a super comfy spot and the cookie was excellent. Wifi worked well, too.

Lots of windows, lots of space. I think that this would be a great place to laptop and get some real work done in the day time."}
{"text":"I was driving through town and just happened to see this place. I expected to walk in and walk out however they actually had four different vegan options! They had a vegan chocolate brownie, two flavors of iced vegan cupcakes, and then I believe it was a vegan chocolate chip banana muffin. I had the chocolate brownie and even though it was a tad on the dry and not so fresh side, I did come right at closing. Plus I was just thrilled to be able to have a brownie!

The place was both cute and clean. Everything was well labeled. The attendant was helpful. I am excited to try other things on future visits!"}
{"text":"This is a lovely little cafe located at the point on 7th Street. They have lots of tables inviting you to sit fir a while.  enjoyed the carrot cake cupcake and boy, it did not disappoint! It was the only choice for me esp. since there was only one left. It was not overly most but yet melted in my mouth. The cream cheese icing was over the top delicious. I think they put a  little something extra in it just for me! Service was great too!"}
{"text":"I live a few blocks away and have been at least ten times since they opened.  My favorites are the muffins, cheddar biscuits and cookies.  YUM.  

I have eaten lunch here and at the other location a few times and the sandwiches are very good though I wish they had a better ingredient to bread ratio - I am often left with a fair amount of bread that had no filling."}
{"text":"I went to Sunflour last Saturday because I was in the Dilworth area and wanted to eat something healthy. My birthday was last weekend, so this was certainly a \"I'm treating myself\" kind of experience. 

I walked in the front door after getting an awesome parking spot and was greeted by 4 of my friends! I had no idea they would be there, but I loved that I ran into them. Sunflour is so quaint and inviting. I could sit ther for hours and drink coffee or tea, ready, chat with friends, eat cupcakes. YUM.

I ordered the Avocado Melt which has avocado, goat cheese, roasted tomato, basil, spinach. You can choose your bread - I did the rosemary sourdough which had excellent flavor and complimented the sandwich well. My sandwich was ready pretty quickly and I also devoured it pretty quickly because it was so good. I did not order a cupcake this time, but my friend did. She got the chocolate cake with raspberry frosting and my mount was watering watching her eat it (umm, that sounds weird, but y'all know what I'm saying). 

I will definitely go back to Sunflour again!"}
{"text":"Oh man, everything about Sunflour is so delicious. If eating cupcakes was healthier, I would eat a cupcake for breakfast, lunch and dinner AND during all the snacks between those meals. I am a regular at the location on 7th Street and I usually order the Avocado Melt on rosemary bread.  It's the perfect blend of avocado, basil, goat cheese, and tomato on fresh delicious bread. As previously mentioned, I love their cupcakes. They are always fresh and they have really food icing.

The nice thing about Sunflour is that the service is typically quick. Most of the tables are pretty small, so they are good for one to four people. You can move the tables around to create space for a larger group is needed. This is a great place to grab quick, good grub, meet up with friends for coffee, read, or study. I will see you soon, Sunflour!"}
{"text":"This is a MUST-STOP, their baked goods, sandwiches and especially soups are out of this world good!  If they've got their creamy tomato basil soup on the menu and you don't order it, you're doing it wrong.  Love this spot!!"}
{"text":"Sunflour's sandwiches are flavorful and fresh, the tea selection is extensive and I always find their teas to be of great quality (Not to mention they give you your on French Press which you can allow to steep as long as you please!). 

The coffee is decent ( although more options for add ins for customers, such as soy and different sugars would be great, considering the local/ organic propaganda all over the place). They also have some unique and delicious breads and pastries (We love the orange hazelnut croissant and the cupcakes are fantastic). 

Despite all this, I go here very infrequently solely because every time I do, I am guaranteed a disgruntled and unhappy cashier and extremely slow service. I've worked in the food biz for longer than I'd like to admit, so I know that dealing with Uppity Elizabeth customers can be taxing, but that's no excuse for the negative attitudes consistently encountered in the employees. In my opinion a more helpful and friendly staff is the only thing standing between Sunflour and becoming a beloved staple of the Elizabeth community.

EDIT: After about 6 months, extensive additions to the menu and a new front of house crew, this place has earned my approval."}
{"text":"I had been eager to try Sunflour #2 since it opened last year.  Sadly, I never found the right time until last week.  I had high expectations, as it's already hard to be competitive in Dilworth, and the original location has always been a win for me.  Needless to say, I was a bit disappointed.

The location offers some parking challenges, and is a bit smaller than the already cramped original.  The food offerings seemed about the same, and the quality was on point, but the service was lacking, and the overall cleanliness was poor.  There was no enthusiasm amongst the staff and I felt like more of a hinderance than a customer.  I had to ask for the only vacant table to be cleaned and I got a look like I had just descended from a spaceship.  Once the table was finally wiped down, the crumbs just rolled onto the seat cushions and some sort of slime awaited me on the floor that I proceeded to slip on. 

I enjoyed my lunch, and the bright light offered from the large windows.  I also found the WiFi to be reliable as I sat there catching up on some work.  I think they would be better suited to remove a table or two to open up the room, as the tables currently feel on top of one another.  The trash and tray return station is on one side of the restaurant, and wasn't even visible from where I sat.  I think adding another on the opposite side would help.

Overall, the experience would've been better for me had it been cleaner and had the staff been a bit more warm.  It wasn't horrible, but it's nothing like the original.  I'll give them a second try at some point, but I'm in no hurry.  I can only hope my experience was based off of the lunch rush."}
{"text":"A new happy place.  

LOVE the hazelnut orange roll (huge, and both cinnamon roll and croissant like at the same time.  SO GOOD).  

Fair trade coffee (major points in my book).  

Definitely gives some competition to Amelie's (from which I am writing this review--oops!) in terms of coffee and food, but has much more limited hours. (You've gotta get that hazelnut orange roll during daylight hours--no midnight snack runs to Sunflour).  

Clever shirts (are you 'bittersweet' or 'semi sweet'?) worn by staff and available for purchase.  

And while I don't have a dog, they seem very dog friendly (dogs tied outside or sitting outside at one of 2-3 tables with owners)."}
{"text":"Such a cool spot! They have a selection of amazing looking pastries (cinnamon rolls as big as your head), breakfast items and sandwiches. 

I got the egg, avocado and cheddar breakfast Sammie and it was huge and very filling. Great quality and delicious! The iced white tea was tasty as well as their iced latte. Their vegan banana chocolate muffin was so delicious and moist!! 

I noticed they have a few gluten free pastries but not sure if they're celiac safe. They will also do their sandwiches without bread to avoid gluten. 

The space is adorable - lots of little bistro tables and a few small tables outside. The bathrooms are very nice too! 

Definitely planning to go back soon and get more pastries next time!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times after work, Sunflour is good but not amazing. I have gotten the infamous giant cheddar biscuit but was disappointed to find it so bland. It's like a big Red Lobster Biscuit minus the garlic sauce on top, I wouldn't order this again unless I get it in a sandwich and splatter some sauce on there. I really enjoyed the macaroons from here, huge and fresh, especially the salted caramel. I'm a little disappointed to find their chai tea latte is made with the ready made Oregon Chai chai tea concentrate that's even available at Walmart.. You can literally make the exact same thing at home in 2 seconds for a fraction of the cost. I've also gotten a day old rolo cupcake for 50% off, so good even after a day. I'll come back here just for those rolo cupcakes and macaroons...maybe a croissant too."}
{"text":"Best croissants ever. Light and flaky while still being rich and fulfilling.

The rest of the baked goods are fantastic as well. I had the \"Morning Glory\" muffin.. Oh my god. It was still warm and moist out of whatever heaven-sent appliance it emerged from.

I stopped by while driving through Charlotte on a road trip because I heard amazing things; and was pleasantly surprised when the food exceeded expectations."}
{"text":"Under new ownership now and sooooooo much better!  New owner really cares about the customer experience.  Still a bit pricey, but a nice treat every so often."}
{"text":"This is a really cute bakery. They have pastries and sandwiches along with a hefty coffee and tea menu. They offer gluten-free options which is always a nice touch. I love the inside area, it's very homey--but it is small. On a busy day it would be pretty crowded in the space.

I had the mint tea which was great and a egg sandwich--sans bread. They put the egg in a bowl on a bed of spinach which I really appreciated. 

I think the price is okay--not great, but not super expensive. I think it's worth checking out if you're in the area and looking for a little spot to grab coffee and a muffin!"}
{"text":"We went to Sunflour for some croissants!....but they were out of them, so that sucked.  We were convinced this trip was a loss.  Fortunately, they make these rolls that sort of taste like a croissant.  We got bacon, egg, cheese and tomato sandwiches on the croissant-like roll and had them toasted.....they were awesome and thoroughly enjoyed.  The only downside was me assuming the sandwich could have been better if it was a croissant.  Some day...some day I'll get that croissant."}
{"text":"I love all the Sunflour Bakery locations (except that the Vanilla Sugar Roll is usually sold out at all of them. They really need to make more) But we were able to save the day with the cinnamon role which was fantastic!

We will keep going to all three locations in search of the elusive Vanilla Sugar Roll!"}
{"text":"We have never left Sunflower Bakery unhappy (except for the time they had a run on our favorite desserts and there wasn't any left. :-) That's what happens when you go too late in the day expecting those favorites to be waiting for you.)

I don't want to mention any of our favorites because they are so incredible and so satisfying that everyone reading this review will run in there and clean them out before we get a chance to drive over. 

So I won't. 

But I will say that EVERYTHING is great and you can't go wrong from the chocolate croissants to the cupcakes to the vanilla . . . uh-oh . . . never mind!"}
{"text":"Between the sandwiches and desserts I'm not sure which one I go in there for anymore. They are all incredible and every time I leave feeling great (and full) I try to figure out how I can get back there again in the near future."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a late lunch today, and sadly, was not very impressed with my experience. I ordered a panini style sandwich (salami and cheddar) on the multigrain bread. For 6 dollars and change I thought it was overpriced. The german chocolate cupcake was very good, but 3 bucks for a cupcake??? The desserts are beautiful .... I'll give you that. May return if I find myself in the area, hankering for something sweet."}
{"text":"i come in here weekly to get a granola bar and morning glory muffin. lots of sugar, but everything is quality. i enjoy their egg sandwich with tomato and avocado too!!"}
{"text":"Just had a delicious Latte and Morning Glory muffin.  Both excellent!

Everyone was very nice."}
{"text":"Sunflour Baking Company has become a bit of a Charlotte classic in my mind. Whenever I'm looking for a convenient, sunny spot to meet up with a friend for good eats and decent coffee, this is my go to. 

I have been here a few times and each time I am impressed and a bit surprised at how diverse their selection is. Sunflour has a range of soups, sandwiches, and biscuits for a lunch approach and of course, a mouth watering array of pastries, cookies, cakes, and scones. This stop at Sunflour I had a whole wheat raspberry muffin (vegan- they often have a few vegan/ gf options in house) and my best friend had a huge chocolate peanutbutter cookie. 

The staff was willing to answer all of our questions and recommended coffee blends. The coffee, however, was just okay. Nothing to write home about. The two baked goods were exactly what we paid for and we were able to sit outside the cafe and enjoy. 

Sunflour is clean, has accessible wifi, decent coffee, and good food. The store is a lovely place to bring a friend or hunker down in to get some work done. There seemed to be quite a few business meetings happening in there as well and that seems like a good idea too. 

Definitely stop in and check it out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Coffee and croissants and amazing and the atmosphere reminds me of New Orleans. Definitely making this my one of my go tos"}
{"text":"First non chain place in Charlotte I've really liked! The croissants are huge and crunchy on the outside with soft, buttery insides. I also had a carrot cupcake, soft and spicy with cream cheese frosting. Pretty good. The cases were full with lots of fresh looking pastries which is not always the case in bakeries. I want to come back to try a key lime pie."}
{"text":"Such a bright sunny spot for a winter day! Sunflour Baking Company is a cheerful, happy spot for a treat. The food is fresh, the pastries are gorgeous and the service is wonderful.  This might be the most cheerful spot in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to for breakfast - but the last two times, I have been disappointed. The service is spotty (either super nice/helpful or not at all) and often times they are out of most of the baked goods. I once waited 40 minutes for a bacon egg and cheese. All that being said, if you go at the right time and they happen to have the cheddar biscuits- get one! It's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Cute little place to spend some time.
I stopped in to get cupcakes for my husbands birthday.
Nice moist cake, yummy frosting.
Definitely worth it. Will be back"}
