{"text":"Food good Service good Ambiance quite nice, quiet areas and the bar which can get noisy, but its a bar"}
{"text":"Overall, this wasn't a particularly amazing italian place.  Above average with good service.  But, the fried zucchini and chicken Parmesan were absolutely delicious!  There's something about the way they bread/fry things.  YUMMY!  Atmosphere: very cozy!  I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews for the service.  Our server was very attentive and gave lots of great suggestions.  I would say the atmosphere/service is probably one of the main reasons I would come back.  Food: as i mentioned before, above average italian food.  pasta looks like it's handmade (but I'm not an itlalian expert).  portions are very large, so order accordingly!"}
{"text":"The Point - 3.5/3.75 stylish lookin' italian joint; pretty solid food & good portions esp. as our entrees included salad/soup & side to make it complete; simple food (http://www.francostrattoria.com/)  The Food  -- Bread     * Better if it was warm  -- Sesame Calamari...$10    *  Think sweet teriyaki type sauce on fried calamari    *  It was real good but a bit too much sauce at the bottom of the plate so overwhelming  --- Salad (comes w/ entree)    * good size; mixed spring greens, tomato, olives, chickpeas, & bleu cheese w/ balsalmic dressing' yum!    * I know it was good cuz BF don't eat greens and he ate his entire salad  --- Chicken Milanese .....$18    * 3 cuts of thin juicy chicken breaded crunchy & garlic cloves yum; can get a bit dry so maybe ask for side of marinara sauce    * tip spread cloves on bread    * entree choice of side - grilled polenta w/ marinara sauce - good thick exterior but soft yum interior; real good w/ sauce       -- Chicken Romano.....$17    * also 3 cuts of chicken; but batter puffy due to egg batter used    * BF choose ranch mash potato as side; zesty, fluffy yum  -- Tiramisu    * thick 3 layers w/ congac & grand mariner  Additional Info * gets busy so make reservations & ask for a table not near bar as can get loud * side options included ranch mash potato, penne pasta & sauce, brocolli, polenta, & asaparagus but they charage extra * skip dessert at restaurant & go next door to bartram house bakery"}
{"text":"Lovely dinner with friends...great ambience and magnificent food.  Staff is professional and friendly.    The scallops with porcini pasta was amazing.   The scallops were seared to perfection.  We already can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I hate to do this because it looks like a majority of people have had an awesome experience here, but.... I was VERY VERY disappointed with this place. My other half and I went on valentines day, and neither of us really enjoyed what we ordered. He had surf and turf and I got a pasta dish with calamari, shrimp, crab, scallops and I believe another seafood I'm missing. My boyfriends meal was okay, he said he's had better, but mine was not good. It tasted so fishy, like the seafood was not cooked right, or very cheap. The taste was actually repulsive. On the bright side, their crab balls were out of this world, and their featured bread pudding dessert was great as well. I'm hoping our experience had to do with the high volume of people that came through because of the holiday. Maybe our food didn't get as much attention as it usually does because it was so crowded? We will definitely be back because I'm trying very hard to find an amazing Italian place near by, and I believe this could be is based on the very good things I've heard about it. Service was good as well, especially for an extremely busy night!"}
{"text":"Classic traditional Italian menu.  Good service and great food.  With places like this, I alway get the chicken parm...it's kind of my gauge on how well they do with \"the basics\".  It was fantastic and the portion was massive.  Four pieces of chicken smothered in sauce and cheese.  Worth trying."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love Franco's! We look forward to coming here each year when we come from Florida to visit our family.   They have the best meatballs and all of the food is excellent!   All the staff is very friendly also.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went here for a date night with my fiancé . The appetizers were great (calamari and zucchini). We didn't know much about Italian wine but our eyes were opened when we tried a new one. Very accommodating and the waitress was attentive."}
{"text":"Just ok. Upon arrival place actually looks a little dirty. Pretty sure the Friday night dinner servers didn't clean floors after their shift nor before Saturday evening rush. Got the house salad- sub par. Sesame calamari- gross. Too.much.sauce. Got some kind of fried crab balls. Meh. Ordered a veal dish, pretty good but the side order of roasted veggies I ordered was steamed, not roasted. Like the frozen bagged kind you get. I wouldn't come back- just ok."}
{"text":"Needing a nice place for dinner while in Pittsburgh, we stumbled across this wonderful place. The atmosphere reminded us of our Italian restaurant back in Illinois. The wait staff was attentive and very friendly. I had the special lobster ravioli with a salmon filet. The flavor was exactly as I had expected, perfect!  The other dish was the shrimp scampi. Some place use too much garlic, but not this place. The best part of the meal was the mashed potatoes. Creamy and seasoned to make you keep going back for more. All in all this was a fantastic place to eat!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but my experience last night needs to be known.... We went to Franco's last night to celebrate a special occasion. Service was lacking; it took our waitress way too long to take our order. My husband ordered the steak special medium rare. The steak arrived medium to medium well (brown with barely any pink). He sent it back- rightfully so. 5 minutes later the general manager and waitress brought his overcooked steak back to him and told him the chef said it was cooked perfectly medium rare and asked if they could make him something else. Insulted, my husband had to explain that medium rare is pink with a warm red center. He didn't want anything else. He wanted a medium rare steak. They argued with us and instead of siding with us, sided with the chef. Then they took the steak back to the kitchen and we sat there as my food got cold, appalled that they would tell my husband he doesn't know what kind of steak he likes. My husband is a chef himself and knows exactly what a properly done medium rare is. We couldn't believe what happened and decided we did not want to continue with our dinner there. The GM came back over and instead of promising to make it right, offered us dessert. Really? Dessert? We hadn't even eaten dinner. We told her we were disappointed and would probably tell our friends and family about our experience- thinking she would offer a better solution- you know, wanting to keep customers. She took our drinks off the tab.   If you are looking for a nice meal with good service DONT GO TO FRANCOS. They hire wait staff that are clearly inexperienced at nice dining and are unaccommodating. Especially for the prices they charge. The General Manager has the entirely wrong attitude and clearly doesn't care if people have a good experience. And the chef has no clue how to cook a medium rare steak.   This place is rude and we left feeling shocked and appalled they wouldn't fix the problem or offer a solution.   Would not recommend. Will not return."}
{"text":"Even after calling ahead to make a reservation and then being told we didn't need to we still had to wait almost 45 minutes to be seated. If you have an infant there is no changing table. There are also sharp metal decorative tiles on the wall in the waiting area that need fixed.   The food was good we had the bowtie with salmon and the stuffed salmon. The waiter was also very nice the hostess however seemed to have an attitude."}
{"text":"had drinks there at the bar, and a meal on a separate occasion. will definitely go back!!! the chicken soup simply amazing. loved fettuccine Alfredo"}
{"text":"Great old school, classic Italian restaurant. Good bread, pasta, and sauces. Nothing too unique or new takes, but quality food."}
{"text":"A great consistent meal. We love the chicken piccata (maybe the best in the city)!  I had the sautéed calamari over a side of pasta. Oh so good ! Love the Bloody Mary and wine selection! A great place that we have had family dinners in the private room downstairs ! The service is outstanding !"}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch with a friend here.   Lisa makes a wonderful martini. Ah, lunch was on a Saturday.   We sat at the bar and enjoyed the banter with the wait staff.  I ordered the Chicken Parmesan and should have gotten the side of pasta that was recommended by Lisa. Nevertheless, it was delicious.  My friend had the burger. He loved it.   I would recommend Franco's."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  The cozy atmosphere, the extremely well trained and hospital staff all set the stage for a wonderful dinner with family.  The Food was all done well, from the fettucine pescatore to the sole fliet all were excellent.  Sometimes it takes the sum of many good qualities to make a great evening, that Franco's has many to contribute.   - Good Job !"}
{"text":"One of my favorites! Their fried zucchini appetizer is the best I've ever had, hands down. The veal romano is my go-to entree and never disappoints... Always cooked perfectly and so good!!"}
{"text":"The food was beyond amazing. I enjoyed every bite, perhaps enjoyed is an understatement.   I ordered the salmon and bow ties and had the stuffed peppers as an appetizer. Both tasted so fresh, the ingredients were definitely of quality and the chefs in the kitchen knew what they were doing. The stuffed peppers were super spicy and the meat inside tasted spiced to perfection. The salmon bow tie dish was huge. The sauce was creamy and I have yet to have a pasta dish comparable. I was very pleased to have leftovers to take to lunch. While at dinner I drank two glasses of their cheapest red wine which was very good, but I am no wine connoisseur.  My bill came to an outstanding number I have yet to see again on a dinner bill (I prefer to eat cheap!) However, that is the price you pay for amazing food of this caliber I suppose.   If you are looking for a romantic dinner, high quality Italian food, or just a good night out at a restaurant (and you don't mind the cost), I would recommend Franco's."}
{"text":"Service will be the downfall of this place which is unfortunate because the food is quite good.  Choose any fish or chicken dish on the menu and you can't go wrong.  The Franco's salad is beautiful and great to share.  Great atmosphere if you can get passed all the attitude with everyone from the hostesses, to the servers, and even the manager who seems to be in denial."}
{"text":"Awesome Italian food.  Try the Stuffed Bannana Peppers, oh my...  There is an upstairs and downstairs.  You don't need a reservation if you have a small party, but expect to have a drink at the bar while you wait for your table/booth.    Go if you haven't, and parking is abundent."}
{"text":"The food is alright. My family and I came first and waiting for our entrees forever and people  that came after us get their food first , almost finish their food is when we get ours. Ask for sauce to go as the guy say yes and never brings him.  Would not come back to this place."}
{"text":"We eat here regularly and it is our favorite restaurant. Consistently excellent food with good service and reasonable prices. They get busy at prime time but it is worth the wait. The stuffed salmon is my favorite."}
{"text":"SOLID ITALIAN MENU. NICE AND COZY.  My hubby, myself and my bro headed here in search of some good Italian now that our fav place Cafe Naples is gone. So we headed to Dormont near where my bro lives to try out Franco's. First off - bread is awesome- pretty sure it's not in house made though. We started with some fried zukes and the calamari except we tried their Asian style calamari and that is my pick of the night for menu fav! Sadly, for our main courses I had order envy. My hubby got the Eggplant Parm which I stole from and it was good. My bro had Chicken Romano which was awesome. I had the Franco Salad which was more like a antipasti than a main dish. I would only get it as an appetizer to share in the future. I did try the black forest Cannoli which was OK. Would go back and try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Love love love the food here we have eaten pretty much everything on the menu. Simply amazing Italian food ! From zucchini as an app or chicken parm for the meal, and lets not forget dessert.  Always stellar service. They always have a special menu for holidays too ! Decent beer selection and great wine selection.  If in the McMurray area I would highly recommend this place for a nice sit down dinner or GREAT for date night !"}
{"text":"Just ate here the other night for the first time. It was delicious! Thankfully we had a reservation, it ended up being a good thing that we made one. We started with some Cabernet. They have a very extensive wine list and a nice wine rack in the dining room. Had a card for zucchini. It was different than I've had it before, but definitely good! The batter is light, not breaded like most places. My boyfriend had the filet. Cooked perfectly and tastes great!! He ate the whole thing, which was huge! I had the linguini pescatore with a white sauce. I couldn't believe the amount I got! It was huge!! The shrimp and mussels in it were delicious, I couldn't stop eating it!! The waitress, Arielle, was extremely attentive and sweet. Not annoying or fake like sometimes can happen. We split the tiramisu at the end, I've never had any better. They make it in house and it shows! We were completely satisfied with our experience and we can't wait to come back! Definitely give it a try if you've never been!!"}
{"text":"I've been going both to this location and to the one in Dormont for several years on holidays and other trips to Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, things seem to have gone way down over the last several years. Someone would have to twist my arm hard to get me to go back.  What really stood out on my first few visits was the quality of the meatballs. On my visit the other day, I thought they were below average. They were mealy, as if the amount of bread crumbs has been pushed as far as it can go.  I had linguine with meat sauce. Honestly, I'd have been happier with a Stouffer's entree cooked in a microwave."}
{"text":"Being new to the Peters Township area, we just tried Franco's for the first time last night. I was really hoping it was something special because it was our wedding anniversary- and it was. The service was wonderful and we loved all the food we ordered (greens and beans, crab stuffed mushrooms, chicken marsala, lobster ravioli, pineapple sorbet, chocolate layer cake). I also really appreciated their ability to help me with my gluten-free and dairy-free restrictions; there aren't many restaurants who offer a dessert that I can have, but sorbet fits the bill. They'll even cook you any gluten-free pasta that you bring in with you. My husband and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"OUT OF BUSINESS!!  RESTAURANT IS CLOSED...  ALL STAFF WAS LET GO AND THE BUSINESS IS UP FOR SALE!!!   Even though the website states that there will be a new concept coming Fall 2014, others we know have stated that there is no concept forthcoming and the business is to be sold..."}
{"text":"Since the Dormont location went out of business and is for sale, we decided to come down to Peters.  Well the decor is bland, menu is the same, the food is the same, BUUUT, its not the same as Dormont and the problem seems to stem from the kitchen itself.  We were told by our server that the Chef from Dormont now works here, apparently, the owner cheaped out when the kitchen was built and it DOES NOT have the equipment to deliver the amount of output and service a restaurant of this size requires.  We and others were waiting and waiting and waiting for our meals to come out.  This appears to be a consistent problem with Francos in Peters!  It's almost as if, there is not enough equipment or capacity in the kitchen to produce more than one or two meals at a time.  This was never an issue in Dormont and its supposed to be the  same Chef, but perhaps not.  Not much you can do to fix a new restaurant with a poorly designed kitchen and a bad kitchen staff, it seems that Francos in Peters may go the same way as Dormont!  Once we did get our food it was average, but waiting for it took waaaaay too long!!  The veal is NOT a tender scallopini, but a veal roast sliced, obviously a cheaper cut.  The special was Spots and was not properly seasoned.   We will not be coming back...  If you want a really good meal and excellent atmosphere, go to Joseph Tambellini's in Highland Park instead!"}
{"text":"Have been here many times before and everything was delicious. However last night was not the best. Ordered chicken parmigiana but it seemed tough, a little over cooked. The meatballs were amazing. When the woman asked how everything was and we mentioned the toughness of our dinner she said she'd bring it up to the kitchen staff. Not sure they did enough to make sure our meal was acceptable. Also had 2 birthdays at our table which they were aware of but again didn't even bring anything to the birthday boys while they did acknowledge a woman at the next table with a treat and a song. Just a little disappointed in our night"}
{"text":"Good service, good food, good portions, always a great experience.  Real Italian food.  Reasonable prices.  Quiet atmosphere.  Best italian in the South Hills."}
{"text":"Celebrated my Sister's birthday at Franco\"s tonight and so happy we did!  From the moment we arrived we were greeted and treated better than Family. The service was impeccable , the food was amazing and we enjoyed dinner on the patio!! Such a treat!!  My niece had the special Virginia Spots topped with lump crab.....Dare I say we all had to try it...Sooo good.  I shared a plate of Chicken Lucca and still had some to take home. Oh and the fried zucchini was shaved thin, lightly battered and served with lemons and Marinara sauce, I highly recommend it.  We decided Franco's is now on the top of our list for favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"3.5 Pretty big dining area and bar.  The food was actually pretty good, especially the marinara sauce.  Salads tasted fresh, the soup was good.  Why only 3.5?  The service was lacking a bit.  The ultra-standout...fried zucchini"}
{"text":"WORST! I walked out and thought I would throw up. Terrible, I'm sorry to say. Took a business client here and service was awful. AVOID!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant in the south hills. AMAZING fried zucchini, yummy chicken pastina soup, excellent chicken Romano. Yum! This place is so good, you'd be crazy to pass it up! They also have a large room in the basement for big groups. The service here is always outstanding."}
{"text":"Had the vegetable risotto that was on special today as an appetizer and it was phenomenal! The veggies were roasted so that they had that smoky crunchy edge I get on my BBQ grill and then mixed in with a creamy delicious risotto. Absolutely heaven in your mouth. My entree was a penne with tomato basil creme sauce and I added one meatball. It came with a salad that was nothing worth mentioning but the pasta itself was very good and the meatball was huge and delicious. My server was Courtney and she was extremely attentive and gave us fantastic service. Well worth checking out for a nice dinner!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Went out for dinner with my husband, place was very loud. Lack of communication at check-in. Food was just mediocre and menu did not have much of a variety."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years but usually do take out.  Last Friday we had a birthday dinner for someone who had never been at this restaurant and we were so pleased to show it off!  The service from John, our server, was excellent and the food was (as always) of superior quality.  We intend to be life long customers!"}
{"text":"The most delicious marinara sauce I have ever tasted. The bar was good; wine was great. I love the atmosphere. My fiance proposed to me at Franco's but I promise that even had he not, this would definitely be a restaurant I returned to again and again. Delizioso cibo!"}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night.  I ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna and cleaned my plate (a little embarrassing), but I couldn't help myself!  We, six of us, had delicious meals.  Our server, (I am so sorry, I can't remember his Spanish name), did a wonderful job.  The owner was there, which to us, is always a good sign.  There's some new items on the menu for August and they all look good.  We shared the fried zucchini, but couldn't finish it, there was so much.  And I had the house salad that was perfect. There are small dishes of items so you can try a few things, or easily add to your meal.   I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place and give it more stars, but I just can't seem to do it.  I've gone multiple times and leave with the same \"blah\" feeling every time I go and my most recent visit was no different.    Service is usually somewhat reasonable but there seemingly is always tension between the staff - which shows throughout the meal...not to forget the place just feels \"cold\" when inside, which possibly amplifies the negative mood.   Put that together with just \"ok\" food and you have what this place is...a conveniently located, bland Italian restaurant in McMurray.   I'm pretty sure I'll return, though hopefully this place can one day change my opinion.  Until then, two stars it is."}
{"text":"No exaggeration, this is some of the best Italian food around!  We visited for a late lunch and were one of only a handful of tables at the time. The hostess and server were extremely friendly and attentive. The fried zucchini appetizer is a must! It is served piled high, with a light and crispy breading. For my main meal, I had a cup of the chicken pastina soup (seriously delicious!) and the chicken piccata. It was a very large serving, and the leftovers tasted just as yummy the next day.  Great service, great food, and nicely priced!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite italian restaurant and their food is delectable. The chicken romano is so good I dont order it anywhere else because theres no one that makes it as well. The cheese tortellini are great in their vodka cream sauce. Meatballs are amazing as well. I dont think I've ever had anything feom there I didnt like. Food is alway fresh and prepared well, service is always prompt and friendly! Large room for parties downstairs."}
{"text":"We ate at Franco's tonight for the second time.  Tonight I started off with Chicken Pastina soup. It was better than my Grandma's recipe straight from Italy.  That is saying a lot. Next I split  two dinners with my Father because we could not decide. The Virgina Spots(Sea Bass) were outstanding. Small portion but I was expecting that when you order spots.  My Dad got the Veal special with 2 large shrimp. My Dad doesn't eat shrimp so it was a bonus for me.  They were cooked in some sort of light red sauce. I don't remember what it was called. It seemed to be a mix between tomato and Marsala. Not sure what the veal was like because my Dad did not share, which is unusual for him. The only reason for the 4 stars is the food took forever to come out. The servers were very good but the food should not take this long on a Monday at 5:30. It was worth the wait though. We will return soon."}
{"text":"Wow.. how have I lived in the area so long and never been here? I can't remember the last time I went to a restaurant and couldn't decide on what to order because everything looked SO GREAT.   in addition to the super fresh food- the wine was a large portion, and was super cold (yelp 5 star). The waitstaff was kind, and on top of everything.   Prices are low compared to other similar restaurants in the area, portions are much larger.. and entrees come with a side and soup/salad. You get your money's worth!   We sat outside on the patio and it was great.   I would highly recommend this restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"Looking for a local, affordable italian joint to have a nice family dinner? Look no further. Walking into Franco's, I felt like I was transported back in time to the 50's when it was all about family and good food. The decor is a little outdatd but in a classic, not kitschy way. I fully expected to see 4 older Italian guys conversing in the back booth clearly trying to keep their mafia business on the hush hush. The homey yet classy feel of Franco's was equally matched by the delicious food and large portions. The menu consisted of classic Italian dishes such as chicken romano, shrimp scampi and gnocchi as well as specials of the day. To start, the four of us ordered the fried zuchini which easily fed four people and could have arguably fed 6. For my main course, I ordered the pork loin special with parmesan risotto and peas, minus the peas. The pork was tender, juicy and cooked perfectly. The risotto was out of this world. So thick, creamy and delicious. My husband ordered another special the penne vodka with prosciutto and mozzarella. Although the vodka sauce was not my favorite, he enjoyed his meal and ended up taking most of the huge bowl of pasta home. Another lovely surprise was that our dinners included a soup or salad. The salad I ordered was delic though once I saw the chicken pastaoli (sp?)  soup, I regretted my decision to try to meet the suggested food pyramid guideline for vegetables. So many restaurants nowadays do not include a soup or a salad. Maybe I just like getting a deal but, when a soup or salad is included with the meal, i feel taken care of.  Regretably, we did not try the desserts largely due to the fact that the portions were so large. The only thing I would change about Franco's is the service. Our waitress did not take our order until after our appetizer came out and she was unable to answer a couple questions I had about the menu.  Otherwise, a great neighborhood, family oriented place."}
{"text":"Average.  Food lacked appropriate seasoning.  Salad was severely under dressed.  Fair corkage  at $10  and better than average service.  Many better options close by."}
{"text":"The owner rectified an error in our take out order by sincerely apologizing and having a staff member drive directly to our house with the correct order and some delicious extras! !  Can't beat that for excellent service!!  Deserves your business. Food, atmosphere, and service are terrific."}
{"text":"We always enjoy eating at Franco's! The Stuffed Banana Peppers are uniquely amazing-a really signature recipe!    The only thing we would change there is to thicken up the sauce on the Linguini with White Clam sauce. It comes in a deliciously flavorful broth, that doesn't really cling to the noodle.  Love, love, love the Chicken Piccata, Chicken Parmigiana, Fried Zucchini, Stuffed Banana Peppers (again!), Virginia Spots, Victoria Salad...just a great menu.    Favorite server there-ShyAnn   Today was the first time she has been our server, and she made our experience doubly awesome!   ALL IN ALL-this is a great place-def go there!"}
{"text":"I really hate to give this place a mediocre review.   I went as part of an 8-person group, which could be part of the issue. Service was so slow. We were there for 3 hours. They appeared to be understaffed on a Saturday night, and the waiter apologized multiple times, but the slow service interrupted our post-dinner plans. We finished the appetizer arrived before we even placed an order - meaning that everyone ate it while holding the (large) menu in their lap. Also, the server was so distracted that he took my neighbor's mussels from her before she was done...  On the plus side, the food is amazing. I think they may have the best fried zucchini I've ever eaten. It was sliced so thinly and covered in the most delicate fried coating - likely just flour without breadcrumbs. Not greasy, and simply scrumptious.   For dinner, I had the vegetable ravioli. They were delicious and had a nice mix of veggies inside. Also, it was a meal that wasn't oversized. No leftovers for me (in a good way)!  Also, while they have a great bar and a god wine selection, you can also bring your own wine. Good to know if you're budgeting or just looking to have a particular wine.   Make a reservation. You'll likely have a better experience than me, and I'll be going back to hopefully bump this up a star or two!"}
{"text":"I had a awesome experience here Friday night. The food was prepared prefectly and was fabulous. I had the Lobster rav topped with scallops and shirmp in a tomato basil cream sauce. The entire meal was cooked to prefection and the sauce was amazing. Katie had brolied sole topped with crabmeat in a casino style butter sauce. Again, perfect!!    The chef is amazing and the staff is excellent. The management runs the dinner rush flawlessly and in a professional manner. Franco's ranks in the top 3 if not number 1 for Italian fare in the city!!"}
{"text":"My wife's group of bakery workers met here to celebrate a birthday of a coworker.  The restaurant staff treated them with disrespect and would not even give them change so that they could leave a tip.  The food delivery was extremely slow.  Being bakery workers they brought their own cake with their own decorations. They were told that there would be a charge equivalent to the cost of a desert just to bring plates and forks to the table.  Other restaurants were not as hostile to this as this one was and the whole experience left them speechless.  All remarked that they would never return and felt very disrespected."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here on the way to the meadows for a bite to eat.   Great decision!  I wasn't overly hungry so just got the mozzarella and tomato salad .... which came with black olives, carrots, chick peas, cucumbers.  Really good! And a side order of the Cappelini w meat sauce.   Very flavorful.   Hubs & I split an order of the oysters Rockefeller ,,,, they were almost a meal in themselves!  He got the fried provolone.   It was literally a wheel of cheese fried and bathed in delicious sauce!   He got penne pasta in marinara sauce with soup.  The marinara was good, but we both agreed the meat sauce was better.   He picked the lobster bisque for his soup and it was divine!    We hadn't been there for a long long time but will definitely make a point to return sooner."}
{"text":"Finally convinced my husband to try this place. Bad idea. My food wasn't terrible. Definitely nothing to bring me back, but my husbands ravioli was disgusting. The ground meat honestly tasted the way canned dog food smells. He will generally eat anything, so if he takes one bite and is done. That means it is BAD. I tasted it myself to make sure he wasn't exaggerating. He definitely wasn't. Won't ever eat their again."}
{"text":"Recently ate at Franco's and figured it is worthy of a good review.  Started off with the Sausage Stuffed Hot Banana Peppers appetizer which was actually different that most i have had in the past.  The peppers had what seemed to be both sausage and pork, although I may be wrong.  The peppers where a bit spicy but nothing to set your mouth on fire.  For my entree I ordered the special, Sautéed Veal Arreganata.  Made with  Imported Panchetta, Roma Tomatoes, Oregano, Fresh Garlic, White Wine Sauté (shhh I stole it from their website =) I had the side of pasta along with my entree.  The veal had good taste but may have been a sauteed a little too much.  The restaurant was rather busy so I could see how this could be possible.    For desert I had the tiramisu and YES it was delicious.  FINALLY a place that actually makes their own!  Needless to say I left Franco's very satisfied and I will be sure to visit again.   I suggest you make a reservation as it is rather crowded on the weekend.  The decor and atmosphere is more modern but I appreciated it.  Reminded me of many place in Newcastle UK."}
{"text":"It was the second time I went there for business dinner . Maybe it's because one of the clients knows the owner but the decor, service , food was all impeccable . I would surely go here again .."}
{"text":"Great service and food ! I love the polenta with sausage . So good ! Wonderful atmosphere and great zucchini best I've ever had. Also love all the veal dishes!"}
{"text":"We went for our anniversary. Food was good, chefs specials were fantastic! We Had Reservations  so we walked right in.  Service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I ate here this past weekend with my girlfriend and two other dining companions for dinner.  I had driven by this place many times before and barely noticed it until a couple of Saturdays ago and mentioned it to my friends who had also been wanting to try it.  Upon entering the restaurant the first thing that I noticed was how large the restaurant actually was as it went back much further from the street than I would have imagined.  After waiting around for a minute or two without being noticed I decided to try to find our friends to no avail.  Finally after 5 or so minutes of waiting for the hostess someone appeared and explained that the rest of our party was already seated downstairs and pointed to a set of stairs.  Surprisingly they actually have a second full dining room and bar downstairs.  For our appetizer our whole table decided to split the fried zucchini appetizer for two.  The portion size was huge and it was easily enough for all four of us to split.  The zucchini had been cut in very thin strips length-wise and was breaded with a nice but light breading and served with a side of marinara and a bunch of different lemons.  What was odd is that we were still left with our menus whenever it came out and seeing how we did not have much room to spare everyone at our table ended up doing something different with their menu.  Personally I put it under my appetizer plate and ate off of it.  Even with that odd arrangement I thought it tasted pretty good, after all who doesn't like fried food, especially when squeezing some of the lemon juice onto the breading.  Finally after we had finished our appetizer the waitress took our entrée order for which I decided upon the chicken romano with a side of their polenta.  The chicken came out on a plate by itself as 3 decent sized pieces.  It tasted good with some hints of lemon and cheese and the breading was also nice and light.  The polenta came out looking almost like a piece a cake with the top very dark, almost black, and was surrounded by a bed of marinara sauce.  It was ok although I can't really tell you that I tasted too much other than the marinara sauce that I was dipping it into.  The bottom line for me is that I would probably come here again in the future.  Our service upon entering the restaurant was not that great although it did improve the deeper we got into dinner.  With that being said I loved the large portion sizes and ended up going home with a full stomach."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Meatballs are amazing. Crab all are greAt. Tortellini in their sauces is my go to. Salads are huge and great."}
{"text":"Was great dinning, food was complementing to service, my 16 month old was a bit Frigidity an they went right along that was appreciated,"}
{"text":"We went to the Peters Township location.  We were a party of 6 celebrating an 80th birthday.  We arrived 30 minutes early but were promptly seated.  Although the restaurant was very busy, it seemed less so because of the very highbacked booth banquets.  Not realizing the quantity of food would be so large, we over ordered.  Below is the list of wonderful food we ordered   Soups Salads Zucchini Beans with Escarole Fried Provolone Sausage and Polenta (the agreed upon winner of the pre-entree selections)  Chicken Marsala x 2 Wheat spaghetti with tomato basil sauce and meatball Wheat spaghetti with meat sauce and meatball Crab stuffed salmon And one other entree that I can't remember  All the food was excellent.  The meat sauce was especially good.    At the end of the meal we had 6 to go boxes.  I can't say enough about Rick, our waiter.  The service was smooth and professional.  In the words of the birthday girl \"They must have given us their best waiter.\"  This was above and beyond what I expected for this suburban Pittsburgh location."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last weekend and cannot believe how good it was! Our waiter was very helpful in guiding us through the menu. We had the zucchini appetizer which was way too much for just us two and was lightly breaded, not overly fried which was a nice change from other places. I had the Virginia spots and have never had better fish.  It was out of this world delicious!  My husband had the chicken parmesean and he said it was the best he has ever had.  We were very impressed with Franco's and will return soon!"}
{"text":"Salad had a GIANT DEAD MOTH at the bottom!!! It had been dead for quite a while. The manager never even came to the table to apologize...I was appalled. And the waitress never even asked if there was anything else they could get for me. How can a business operate like this? Unbelievable. This was one of my favorite restaurants. Our business even had client events there.  After this moth incident, we will certainly NEVER be eating at this restaurant again. I am reporting them to the health department."}
{"text":"The food is always on point.  Consistent, fresh, high quality ingredients.  The service is great, great wine list and bar area.  I get the Spots every single time.  They are the best around.  We go here with friends, date nights and with our kids."}
{"text":"I have had the Chicken Marsala and Chicken Piccata here a couple times and they do not have a lot of flavor. The chicken pastina soup is plentiful with pasta, chicken, and egg but was very salty when I recently bought it in a quart size to take home. I think that this restaurant is over priced for what you get and there is a lot of room for improvement. Also, there is a lack of options for anyone that is allergic to seafood as the majority of the menu has some kind of fish and/or shellfish in it."}
{"text":"We haven't been to Franco's in a long time.   The atmosphere was mellow and the service was excellent. We had mussels Pomodoro as an appetizer (lots of mussels, very good sauce). SO had crab cakes ('very good'), I had linguine with white clam sauce (my drug of choice) also very good  We will be back."}
{"text":"We've been here twice and both times it has just been \"okay\". The food is pretty basic without any real flavor and the service was unimpressive. Both times we went our waitress and waiter didn't really seem interested and at one point 30 minutes had gone by without anyone even looking in our direction. Which meant that drinks weren't refilled and we had to get up and ask the hostess to send someone over. I found that to be pretty annoying. I don't think we will be back, there are plenty of other quality italian restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Living in Peters, my wife and I were ever so excited when they opened the Peters location.  We have visited several times and and have enjoyed all of our visits to both the Peters and Dormont locations.  There are items that we love on the menu like the meatballs."}
{"text":"The more one visits other restaurants, the greater one should appreciate what a gem Franco's is.  The food is delicious, there is ambience and romance in the air, the service is consistently outstanding, the prices are fair, and Joe, the devoted hard-working owner: a constant presence, ensures that everything comes off without a hitch.  It does not get better than Franco's Trattoria!"}
{"text":"We read a lot of the reviews where people had bad service, long waits, and bad food. The large party sitting behind us had been waiting for over an hour for their main course. We didn't really experience any of that -- our server was attentive, the food came out in a timely manner, and was good (not great).   My husband's Eggplant Parmesan was burnt on the bottom and along the sides, but the meatball and pasta were good. My capellini and tomato basil sauce was good. We both like the house salads because they are fresh and have chickpeas.   All in all, it was a decent meal though not sure we need to go back for a while. Definitely not as good as the former Dormont location."}
{"text":"Very good food!  Their lunch is very reasonable and is filling.  The staff is really nice and is very attentive.  We had a party here with 55 people and they did an excellent job!"}
{"text":"Used to be a very good restaurant; however, that has changed.  I ordered veal and it was thick and tough.  That was all that was on the plate.  A lot of money for not much.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I am a long time patron of Franco's and it almost pains me to write this review but the quality of both the food and the service has been slipping for some time now. I have had most things on the menu and just the overall food preparation is just not there. Last evening I had the Victoria Salad which was very good, but my main entrée of Chicken Romano was bland and tasteless. My prior visit I had the Spots done English Style which had always been a favorite and it just isn't as flavorful as it once was. Rather dry. The quality of service is up and down....some days good. Others almost absent. Franco's is living on its reputation and the fact that it is the only really affordable upscale restaurant in McMurray."}
{"text":"Great food service is good. Italian sauce is fantastic. One of my  wife and I favorite places to eat. Never had a bad mill."}
{"text":"So, a friend and I were going to try Varrati's pizza. She had come all the way from New Kensington to visit me...  ...only to find that Varrati's didn't open until 4pm. It was a little after 2.   Thank heavens for swerves in itineraries. We were meant to come here. Fate would allow nothing else this afternoon.   I saw Franco's Trattoria, just a few blocks up.   \"Let's go there,\" I said.   We walked into the posh establishment, and a distinguished older gentleman, perhaps the owner himself, greeted us as he dined with a companion.   \"Seat yourselves,\" he told us. \"Anywhere's fine.\"   I felt a little slovenly in these surroundings with my jeans and AC/DC t-shirt on, yet our wonderful server (a beautiful Italian-fashion-magazine-cover-bound girl named Jennifer) told us when I asked about our casual attire, \"Oh no, you're fine!\"  Once again, when you eat anywhere Italian in Pittsburgh, even if you're an Eastern European/Irish mutt like me, you feel at home.   Besides, a little kid ran past me in gym shorts and an oversized tee.   EVERYTHING we had was divine and brilliantly plated. I wish I had brought a camera with me so as to snap some pics of this gorgeous, gorgeous food with flavor and personality for days  \"Angry. Look angry. Give me pouty. Pouty, that's it!\"   Yeah. Drop dead knockout food that should be against the law. It would make a grown bon viviant cry. Cue any other cliched hair metal lyric about hot chicks you can think of.  I really wasn't sure what to order, but oddball me likes to make meals out of appetizers and salads.  So it was...  ...the masterful calamari. It's hard for me to pass up that deep fried squid. Even seeing tentacles doesn't deter me. Hell, I wanna see them! They were breaded expertly, were perfectly al dente, popping in my mouth as I chewed on them, that marinara sauce dressing the squid up in culinary love like it was Madonna in 1985.    You remember that song. Don't lie.   At the same time, I was served something called Crab Joseph. I love crab, but I had no idea what Crab Joseph was supposed to be. Here it was a sweet, light, cold, lemony salad of sorts with greens, tomatos, scallions, shrimp and plump, juicy chunks of jumbo lump crab meat.  A jones for crab and a sense of adventure can take you to Paradise.   My ladyfriend dined on her Ravioli and let me try one. I got jealous. Until they brought out the Victoria Salad anyway. According to their menu, it has \"baby field greens, candied pecans, apples, gorgonzola cheese and raspberry walnut vinaigrette.\" Oooh yeah. That viniagrette and the candied pecans made the salad as far as I am concerned, but the apple more than held its own. It was exotic, a sheer and sweet delight.   We had plans to go to an ice cream parlor about 20 minutes away until our sneaky waitress showed us the dessert menu.   You should have seen my tiramisu. It was ART, for the eyes as well as the tongue and stomach. It was light and rich at the same time with just the perfect blend of rum, coffee, and whatever cheese they use (marscapone?).  It was a clinic in confectionery. Eccellente!   My friend could not finish her Three Layer Chocolate Cake, so I came in to save the day. Normally I like my chocolate cake rich and gooey, but this dessert made the case for a chocolate cake that doesn't need to be overly sweet and dense to be delectable, and it was more than delectable. In fact, it was as angelic as a chocolate cake could be. It should be served with a halo above it.   Please take a date here, or if you're of the fairer species, beg to be taken here or drop some weighty hints.   How many times did I ride past this classy, awesome, yet moderately priced place o'er the years without seeing it?  È scosso il mio mondo!  And to think all we came out for was some pizza."}
{"text":"Went here on a date with my fiancé and started off with 2 glasses of wine which were a bit over priced at $7 per glass. Ordered the mussels which were excellent and were huge pieces. I could have eaten these as a meal alone. We got the crab stuffed salmon and the chicken with pasta. Both meals were cooked well and were delicious. Service was excellent and the atmosphere was nice and quiet. Only reason I wouldn't give 5 stars is that the main meals weren't excellent but they were just good meals. I would recommend it to others"}
{"text":"Look beyond the Italian, and yes, its good. But, absolutely the best sirloin burger. You add toppings you want like sauted onions, mushrooms, peppers, cheese, tomato, lettuce. Love their salads...Victorian with candied nuts and the Grilled Tomato Gargonzola. Pgh salad too. You eat as is or add chicken, shrimp etc."}
{"text":"Traditional Italian.  Thoroughly enjoyed every dish. Be forewarned--portions are ENORMOUS.   Appetizer portions are reasonable meals. Our party of 4 ordered these apps:  Calamari-so tender, served in tomato sauce. Not fried! Fried zuchinni- as good as it gets, plateful about the size of a basketball Fried polenta and sausage- next time will be my meal with a salad. Full 1\" slice of polenta topped with a more than generous slab of high quality sausage and tomato sauce. Fantastic. Stuffed banana peppers-i did not sample this one, though everyone loved it. We had at least half of each of the appetizers boxed to take home.  For dinner, I chose a chicken dish, I believe it is called \"Salvatore\". By the way, veal may be substituted for chicken in any of their dishes. Anyhoo, this was 3 (!) chicken breast halves, each topped with fresh mozzerella and a sundried tomato sauce. Absolutely delicious and ridiculously huge.  Random observations: the candied pecans that came with one of their salads and also on the Pecan Ball, might be something to avoid if you have extensive or fragile dental work!  Service was great and the bartender is every bit as generous as the kitchen. My 1800 on the rocks filled a rocks glass and was not stuffed with ice. I kid you not.   Will absolutely return, but order my food with less abandon."}
{"text":"Our server made this restaurant a great experience. We let him know it was our first time here, and he suggested some of his favorites on the menu. We had fried calamari sesame style, fried zucchini, and for entrees a chicken dish with prosciutto and a seafood pasta dish. The seafood pasta was amazing. The calamari was a little salty because of the sesame sauce. But everything else was great. I wish I could remember our server's name to give him a shout out. Thanks, bald head  glasses waiter! I want to call him Brian, maybe. I will certainly return here in the future."}
{"text":"Am I at Bucca di Bepo? Seriously, that's what I questioned during our meal here. In traditional Italian American fashion, the portions are ginormous. And by ginormous I mean a whole family of four could eat off these portions. This doesn't even include the salad you get with your meal.   I wish I knew that before we ordered the fried zucchini. It's okay though. I've never had such lightly battered, yet crisp fried zuc in my life. They were thinly sliced pieces of deliciousness. You can still easily split the pile of zuc they give you between four people.   For an entrée I was craving eggplant parm. What I got was two massively cut pieces of what looked like lasagna. I believe the make up was as follows: eggplant, cheese, eggplant, cheese and more cheese. Whatever, it was really tasty. Throw in a decent sauce and perfectly cooked ziti noodles, and I'm sold.  Family style rules here, and that's okay with me, and my need for leftovers."}
{"text":"This is the second location of the Franco's located in Dormont.  It should be noted that there is a Franco's in Fox Chapel, but he just sold the naming rights to this location.  And, it is no relation to the Bravo Franco downtown.  I made my first visit here yesterday for lunch and had a pretty good time.  It's in Peter's township located in a strip mall, but don't let the strip mall location deter you.  In fact, I've found a trend recently of some decent restaurants choosing inexpensive strip locations (Jimmy Wans Tai Pei in Cranberry for example) and serving above average food or some might even say fine dining in a casual atomosphere.  The interior itself is quite pleasant.  They use grey and black colors along with hardwood floors and sparse seating to give it a cool or relaxing feel.  When you walk in there is a bar area to your right with about enough seating for 7 or 8 and a few other tables or hi tops in the middle section.  Directly to the right of the entrance are several large booths and further back is I guess their version of a wine cellar with several bottles displayed.  They also have a section that is somewhat seperated that allows for a lot of lighting to come in and I noticed doors that can be shut, so they may even offer this room for private events.  Tom and I sat at the bar and there were a couple plasmas behind the bar and I noticed a couple othe ones in the bar area dining section.  We were greeted quickly by a friendly server (don't recall her name) who said they just started offering lunch in February and it seems to be doing well.  She also stated the bar area is packed in the evening and the locals seem to really have embraced this place.  I guess I can understand that Peters did need another option besides Atrias for this type of bar.  Okay onto the food.  I let Tom order since he dines here often.  We stuck mainly to the appetizer menu.  First we tried the greens and beans or according to the menu \"braised white beans with escarole\", we also added two sausages for the reasonable price of $1 each as an add on.  I think the whole dish was $8.  The greens were okay, but I found them in general underseasoned and not that flavorful.  The sausages tasted reasonably welll, but were kind of luke warm.  They could have used more heat.  We also tried the sesame calamari, which was calamari with what they termed a sweet soy glaze and sesame seeds.  This was pretty much a miss for me.  I love calamari, but this calamari was overcooked and overbreaded and the glaze (which was like general tsao's sauce) was wayyy too overpowering.  If this dish was lightly breaded and quick fried (not overcooked) with about 1/3 the sauce or the sauce on the side I'm sure I'd love it, but all in all this wasnt that great.  The only standout that we had were the crab stuffed mushrooms.  This was probably the only thing somewhat freshly prepared as the mushrooms were still sticking to the hotplate.  It's lucky we were able to get these because for some reason they are not on the lunch menu, but luckily Tom knew enough to ask.  These were four mushrooms overflowing with a very good jumbo lump crabmeat mix with only a small amount of filler.  It was by far my favorite of the three we tried and pretty much the only redeeming offering foodwise.  If I were to base this review solely on this experience with the food I'd probably only give it two stars, however I've been to the Dormont location and I know they usually have very good food.  Also, the service was excellent and I really liked the overall feel of the space.  I'll give it another shot.  The waitress told us the owner is thinking about opening up a North Hills location, which I hope they do because both spots are a pretty long drive from where I'm located."}
{"text":"25 min late for a reservation on a Thursday. Saw we were pissed so they offered free app whih was not too good so got free drinks.... Slightly better  Can't imagine what a Friday would be like  Cold bread but good salad Chicken with moz. -chewy not fresh at all Sole with polenta- ok Chic parma-good  Maybe yelp has turned me into a snob?  UPDATE: I  started this review 2 months ago and never posted. Normally i would just delete, but this was such an awful experience I'm gonna post anyways. Maybe somethings changed since then, but IDK...."}
{"text":"Worst food I ever had.  So bad that I didn't even tell the server because I would not eat anything there again.  I think the server know because my husband an I took one bite and both said it tasted like dish water.  Then never ate another bite."}
