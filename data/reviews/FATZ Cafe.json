{"text":"We had a great experIence , the waiter was super nice and helpfull, the kids chicken fIngeRs were delicious and so was the chicken pot pie! Salads and soup were fresh and tasty, also the poppy seed little munchkins were yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome must try the shrimp and grits!!! bartender was great, only complaint food took way to long"}
{"text":"Great Southern fried foo. Go there if you are not looking for a healthy option. Even their bread was fried!!!! Five star goes to our waitress who was the best till date. I have never had such an amazing service before.  Food to Try: Cajun Appetizer"}
{"text":"Asian salad was crisp and nicely coated with dressing, Delicious basa fish with Parmesan crust, and the peanut pie - delicious and the addicting hot rolls.  All reasons to dine here.  The wait staff friendly and accommodating.  A very nice experience all around."}
{"text":"I signed up for a Yelp account just so I could write this review! Husband ordered the Sunday Fried Chicken and I ordered Turkey nd Dressing, My plate was the most sad mushy mess of food just thrown on a plate. It was unappetizing salty and cooked to death. I could not eat it! My husband took one bite of the chicken and pulled a piece for me to taste. Gawd it was awful. It was fried in dirty oil that had that rancid dark burned taste. It was disgusting. Tbe quality of the food is terrible! We ate nothing but the first bite, asked the server to bring us the check so we could leave. Since we had not eaten any of the food the manager apologized and said we would not be charged but to take care of tbe server. We left a tip for the server and left. At $10.99 a plate, quality and taste should be their number one goal. Please do not contact me with offers or coupons as tbe quality of the food here is so terrible I will never go back. I tried to post with no stars but you are required to give at least one which is not deserved here."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is pretty standard for a chain restaurant. The place is neat and organized, but it could benefit from a deep cleaning (dusty blinds, stained menus, worn tables).   They start you off with hot rolls and honey cinnamon butter (very tasty). The rolls are pretty small (which I like). I don't have to feel guilty for eating more than one.   Overall, the food is just okay. But there are a few menu items that I really enjoy: the dry rub wings and the grilled vegetable skewers (squash, zucchini, mushrooms, etc). That's why I'm here today :-)   The service is usually good. Both the hostesses and the waiters are friendly. It's not a bad spot if you're in the area and you're in the mood for American comfort food (ribs, burgers, cobbler)."}
{"text":"Food ok. Don't get the asparagus, soggy and bland. Not really impressed with waitress just not great."}
{"text":"I'm about 50/50 on Fatz. My husband loves their salmon so we eat there often . I love the Calabash chicken but if I'm dieting I feel pretty left out . Service can be hot or cold . I'd actually give them a 2.5 if it were available."}
{"text":"Went to the Fatz in the Afton Ridge area.  Not great.  I'd been there before with a friend and wasn't really wow'd, and I stopped in yesterday for lunch because I was shopping in that area.  1st, they seated me in the bar, probably because I was dining alone.  Then I ordered the fried chicken (bone in), and the waitress came back to tell me it's not on their menu any more \"because they couldn't cook it right.\"  \"I have no idea why it's still on that menu!\" she says.  So I ordered the turkey and dressing special.  When the waitress took my order, she sat down in the booth with me like I was her best friend.  Ok, I guess. The food came out in about 2 minutes, which usually isn't a good sign.  Fatty turkey slices on top of boxed dressing, mashed potatoes, green beans.  No gravy on the potatoes, and everything was luke warm and not at all hot. The waitress then proceeded to go to another booth where a man had just been seated, and she sat in his booth too to take his order.  He asked \"How are you?\" and she went on to tell him in great detail about her \"deviated septum\" and how her mother has one, and she's been so sick, blah, blah, blah.  Didn't give me much confidence that my food wasn't going to be contaminated by this sick waitress.  Also, when she brought the iced tea to my table, and to one other, I watched her at the bar use her hands to pick up the lemon slice and stick it on the side of the glass.  Not very sanitary.  The apparent manager came by after I took about 5 bites of my food and pushed it away, and he asked how everything was.  I said \"Just ok.\"  He asked how it could have been better.  I told him that none of the food was hot but only barely warm.  He said \"Oh, well I'd better check on that.\" and went toward the kitchen.  I never saw him again.  I will avoid this place.  Clearly over priced for the bland food they have."}
{"text":"Incredible chicken tenders!  I've never had fried chicken so tender before, and their hot buffalo sauce is amazing!"}
{"text":"This is my 1st time here - definitely coming back - the food is amazing - you gotta try the fried green tomatoes!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best loaded cheese fries I had in a long time!!!We had fried fish which comes with potato soup and fries, and chicken with pasta and mushrooms. Very tasty food!!!!Oh, and the bread with cinnamon butter is a cherry on top. The servers were friendly, I could tell they worked as a team. I will be back soon"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, ditzy waiters. Have to beg for rolls."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for big portions of good food this is the place to be! Everything we had was very tasty and the portions were huge! I recommend the ribs and chicken."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and both times the service was awful! Our first visit, we waited forever to get our food, and they messed up the order! So I had to wait an additional 15 minutes. They didn't offer a discount or anything for messing up the order or for our wait. The second time, we came when it wasn't super busy. We only saw our waitress about two times and we had to wait for refills, napkins, etc for awhile.   Overall, bad impression. Don't think it's worth coming back. Food is good but definitely over-priced!"}
{"text":"Date Night - Good food.... Great company. The Salad was very good, love the dinner rolls, Aubrey was a great waitress very attentive and the. Manager Roland liked our feedback."}
{"text":"I've been here several times with my family, and we like it here because of the friendly staff form the hostess to the server, and the food is fine just like any sit down restaurant. It's quiet too and not crazy busy like the Concord Mills area. I love their fall off the bone baby back ribs and it's become my usual order now. Next time, I'll post photos!"}
{"text":"So So at best. I started eating at this restaurant in Concord back when it opened up. But sad to say it has really went down in all areas. Good places are so hard to find and its bad when a good one goes down."}
{"text":"This was a great stop for lunch! The menu is pretty diverse and we got seated right away. Service was very good and attentive. Would go back again the grilled chicken was excellent."}
{"text":"My heart was broken today when I rushed to Fatz Cafe before lunch hours were over only to find they have CLOSED!!! I wonder why no one was answering the phone.   Really hate to see they are gone.  I will truly missed them."}
{"text":"I kept seeing FATZ everytime I would go catch UFC fights at the Tilted Kilt which is right beside this location but I finally decided to go dine their with a friend for the first time recently and I must say I was pretty impress. For all of the other chains like Applebees, Chillis, O'Charleys,Red Lobster, Olive Garden that get mention ad nauseam, I'm surprised no one recommended it to me before but perhaps it's just not big in this area. At anyrate, it was a fairly quiet evening over there so we were able to get seated right away and our server did well in providing quality service. I haven't spent much time in the menu but they have the type of variety & prices that's on par with applebess\o'charleys. For my beverage, I have this cherry peach sangria which I paired with this parmesan fish plate which sat on top of a palette of rice and I wanted to keep the broccoli that came with it. I must say that had to be one of the tastiest piece of fish I had ever consumed. The lightly breaded fish with that melted parmesan blended perfectly and melted right in my mouth. The broccoli was also crisp and complemented my meal well. I even tried some of my dates fried green tomatoes appetizer since she wasn't hungry enough for a full meal and those turned out to be a pretty unique treat too. Needless to say, I won't be sleeping on this establishment any longer and I hope even folks who are burnt out on the whole chain restaurant deal would give them a chance for a nice casual dining experience."}
{"text":"Poor quality food and real lack of service. No management in sight. Couldn't get tea refilled and French fries were fried In Disgusting old oil. Chicken tenders are micro small now. No thanks"}
{"text":"Saw this place and stopped in while I was having my dog groomed across the street. Wasn't bad but it's not memorable. Had the Asian salad and it was good but drenched in dressing. Make sure to ask for it on the side. My companion had a wrap and it was ok. Service was great and food was out fast. Place reminded me of an Applebee's."}
{"text":"I love the salads here! So plentiful and fresh. The ribs/shrimp dinner was delicious as well and dare I say the firecracker stix - AWESOME. i do suggest you ask for recomenndations if you have shellfish allergies as many of these items have shrimp. It is listed on the menu but we all know how we can overlook that one important ingredient. So make sure to ask! The atmosphere is definately family friendly in that it's non-smoking. Yep! The entire facilitiy is non-smoking. Now, i don't mind having to go outside to smoke if I'm sitting at a bar having a drink. But they don't have T.V.'s. That's the only reason I didn't give 5 stars. Granted it's been at least 6 months since I've been there (only because I moved up North). So they may have fixed that problem.  Anyhow! Great place to take your family or go for a business lunch!"}
{"text":"I've always been a huge fan of this chain but my most recent trip to the one in Gaffney was extremely disappointing. The calabash chicken was dry and the complimentary rolls were hard and felt as though they were reheated in the microwave."}
{"text":"Father's Day after church on Sunday...obviously not the best time to go for a party of seven, although the wait was only about 30 minutes.  We were seated and waited a few minutes for our drink order to be taken, then a little bit longer than normal for them to be delivered...our waitress didn't seem overly busy in her section, so maybe the kitchen was backed up? I'm not sure.  Anyway...we ordered our food, several getting soups or salad as well as a meal.  The soups arrived a couple of minutes before the entrees and the salads did not...we had to ask for them...which the waitress brought out after our entrees were delivered...with the wrong salad dressings.  Now I'm thinking .. hmm...okay...still not sure what the problem is, but it's getting kinda aggravating at this point.  The waitress was friendly enough and our glasses were kept full for the most part...but then two of us were still eating (not even close to being done because of the delay in salad delivery) and she asks the other end of the table about desserts...and proceeds to ask down the table and I replied as politely as I could that I was still enjoying my meal and wasn't ready to discuss dessert just yet...I mean really??  Help me out here!  Yes they were finished on that end of the table, but they of course replied, we'll wait until everyone is done...there were no people still waiting by the way and no reason to be hurried out in my opinion.  To her credit, or maybe the manager's I'm not sure, they did give the two of us who had to wait complimentary strawberry shortcake for all the hassle and that is why I have GENEROUSLY given the fourth star today...although a 3-3.5 would probably be more accurate for today's experience.  I tried the Blue Ridge Mountain Chicken and it was 'okay' nothing I would order again, but the grilled skewered veggies were delish as always.  We also ordered ribs & shrimp, lite aloha chicken, a daily special with steak, shrimp and chicken fingers, a burger, and 2 wraps at our table and everyone seemed pleased enough with their meals.  Desserts we sampled were peach cobbler (very very good) brownie with ice cream (very good) banana split sundae (looked okay I didn't try it) and the two complimentary strawberry shortcakes that were quite good.  I'll be back to Fatz I'm sure, their variety and usually short wait time and good service in the past wont deter me...maybe today was an off day, but it wasn't the greatest 2 hours I've ever spent in a restaurant for sure!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for frozen restaurant vendor foods. But I have to say, the manager did impress me when I did not like the fried green tomatoes and he had the wait staff take them back and bring me something else.  That alone got the third star."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. Our server was very soft spoken- almost creepy. The table had holes in it. Said something to the hostess and she said they will be getting new tables soon. Had a late night last night so the Mrs ordered a Bloody Mary. It was not great and a little too much mix in it - making it too spicy.  We ordered the baked potato soup- which was wonderful. I liked the taste and consistency. We also ordered the chicken pot pie. It was bland and not very good. I heard my girlfriend say the topping \"tasted like grass.\"  We won't get that again. The server suddenly became very talkative (to the table beside us) while we were waiting for water refills. I never did get a refill of my water. I guess you have to ask for more here. This is my second bad experience here. I won't be back for a third."}
{"text":"This is similar to a Ruby Tuesday's or an Applebee's.  I've been 2x & multiple take outs.  They are dependable & predictable.   Std salad, sandwich, & burger menu.  Nothing fancy here - great if you want a sit down place instead of fast food."}
{"text":"It's ok, service.is great but the food is mediocre. Maybe it is because it is a chain..not sure. But I did not enjoy it the last time i was there."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time eating here. The food is great, but the customer service is horrible. When you enter any restaurant the hostess is suppose to set the tone. This hostess had a attitude...acting like she didn't want to be there. Then you could hear each and everything the people in the Kitchen were having a disagreement about. Just loud and ghetto for no reason. You could hear their complaints, who got on their nerves, who was late etc. you could hear it all. I tell you this much, I've never been to Red Lobster, Fridays or Olive Garden and heard any of the staff acting crazy in the back. Whoever is in charge of this location needs to train your staff on professionalism. Your staff need to understand that their is a time and place for everything. If undercover boss were to come here the owner would be extremely upset and embarrassed. And I'm sure a lot of people would be fired!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went and grabbed an early dinner Sunday night. It was my boyfriend's first time there, so they brought him out a sample of their hand-breaded chicken tenders. They were great! Crisp, not greasy and you could definitely tell they were hand-made. The complimentary rolls were amazing too.   I ordered a burger and my boyfriend got the endless baby back ribs. Both were juicy and delicious. Our waitress was very friendly and on top of things, and offered to put in a second order of ribs when she brought the first one out so that my boyfriend didn't have to wait for his second round.  I was very impressed by both the service and quality of food. I will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"We decided to try dinner at Fatz at the recommendation of our daughter.  We were greeted by the Manager, arrived early, and was promptly seated.  I became suspicious as it seemed as if the restaurant was \"trying too hard\" to provide customer service.  What I mean is that there almost was a sense of desperation on the part of the Management and staff.   I will admit that there was one good food item.  The fresh dinner rolls with honey butter was amazing.  However, the four meals we ordered were just as bad as the rolls were good.  I had the fish and chips.  After a few bites, I had to send the fish back to the kitchen.  You guessed it, \"too raw\".  After eating a raw fish, my meal was basically over.  The Manager came and took the order back to the kitchen for a re-cook.  When it returned, I still had the same original French fries.  The other three meals were equally as bad and everyone at the table agreed that we were marking this restaurant off our list.  Concord has many great restaurants but this one did not make the grade."}
{"text":"We go to Fatz in Concord often. The Calabash chicken is the BEST chicken around, very tender and flavorful without being too spicy. My husband orders the pot roast and it is very tender with terrific gravy and mashed potatos. I have also gotten the shrimp kababs and  hot wings. both very very good. We sit in the bar and get excellent service each and everytime and the manager never misses an opportunity to check in with us to make sure all is ok. Jennifer is the server we always ask for... top notch service and gets things right! Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Not a great visit this time..... Saturday night and the place is pretty dead. Appetizers were fine..... chili was ok....tried to order the 18oz. Bone in rib eye.... they were out.... had to get the 14oz.... ordered medium.... should be warm pink center.... The steak came out as if it was cooked on the surface of the sun... no apology, half ass offer to recook it..... the manager obviously didn't give a shit because he never came over...."}
{"text":"Took my family some where different to eat, worst thing I done was go to Fatz! The wait time was for ever with only a few people in there. Staff did not help each other manager was lazy, she just set around behind us talking. After we all sent our dishes back cause none of them where right their was still problems. Never brought A1 for our steaks etc. It's one thing to mess up a dish but 4 that's crazy. Waiter did not know what she was doing or were she ran off to by far my worse trip to any restaurant, and my last here! You could not pay me to go back. So save your money and time!"}
{"text":"Waiter was nice  Food was just. OK.  Had sirloin and red potato mash. Bacon in salad tasted like fake bacon and balsamic dressing little flavorless."}
{"text":"Fatz is a place that I frequent somewhat during my lunch hour but will be reconsidering coming back for a while.  The place is never busy during my lunch hour so one would expect for food to come out hot. Unfortunately, on my last couple times to Fatz the food has arrived lukewarm and I've had to ask for the complimentary rolls instead just having them automatically brought out (like normal).  During my last visit this afternoon, the waiter was quite distracted and seemingly uninterested in doing his job. Food and drink was just plopped onto the counter and he was obviously not interested in hearing about satisfaction regarding the meal.  Fatz is mediocre at best so I would suggest ordering your meal to go!"}
{"text":"This place was ahhhhhh-mazinggggg the food is awesome the fried green tomatoes were GREAT!! I got the Parmesan fish and my hubs got the shrimp/bacon skewers and every bit of it was well worth it!!! The service was EXCELLENT. I highly recommend it to anyone and without a doubt we will be back!!!!!!! Not to mention the complimentary rolls are the bomb... Very cold beer and wine!!! Excellent experience"}
{"text":"I have to update this review by adding one more star only due to the fact that the establishment's owner and manager have contacted me in an effort to better my experience in the restaurant on my next visit.  Although I will more than likely not come back to this place because I don't live in Charlotte and was only there for work, this fact alone is deserving of an uptick in rating.  Customer care matters.  Thanks guys."}
{"text":"After a wonderful day at church today, my daughter wanted to take me to have lunch so we decided on Fatz. We've been going here for years as a family...today it was just us two. There was a young woman who walked in maybe about 1 minute before us who was waiting so we stood in line behind her. No one acknowledged my daughter and I. The two young females were checking to see if they had room for that young woman's party. Then these older females with a young boy walk in and the young female asked them how many. At this point I got upset because she didn't even acknowledge us. I was like excuse me but we've been standing here and no one asked us anything. I had to remember to keep my cool cause I just went to church. The young hostess stated she assumed we were with the other young woman. I don't even know how she assumed we were with her cause we didn't walk in with her nor did we talk to her. At that point I should've walked out cause she did not have a good attitude nor did she apologize. She asked how many in my party before she took us to our table. She was not nice at all. My daughter and I noticed a whole different atmosphere in the restaurant we've been going to for years...it just didn't seem like the nice friendly place we used to enjoy going to as a family. It seems they have hired a whole new staff. I told my daughter we are not going to let this get us down...we had enjoyed church today as always. Although I have to say our waitress was very nice but we will not be eating at Fatz no longer."}
{"text":"I have been to a couple of these and had a better experience.  Yesterday, while working in the area I decided to give this location a try.  First off, the hostess and the African American woman were clueless at the front when I asked about outlets to plug my laptop.  I was surprised to learn there was a shortage of them.  I was not pleased.  Finally, I was seated at the bar.  The bartender was the best thing this place had going for it at lunch time.  I will not be back.  I gave it two stars because of the bartender and the food."}
{"text":"Great experience at FATZ after leaving before even being sat in the past. Service and food were both incredible. We had the southern sampler and side salads. Food was fresh and delicious! Would highly recommend and will be back!"}
{"text":"First, the pimento tray was small... Very small. Second, the lettuce in the salad was brown. Sent it back. Third strike, the meat in the pot roast pie was obviously cooked separate from the dish. It had a white glaze to it, but the sauce in the dish was brown. Needless to say, I ate what I could and let the rest stay where it laid.  No more Fatz for me!!"}
{"text":"This was not the first time I had been to this restaurant, but it was the most satisfying time...my hope that this was more the way it ought to be rather than what it used to be.  My husband and my friend Mary went to meet some family members for dinner this past Saturday night and it really turned out well.  Though we were just going to meet there, eat and run out to an outdoor concert, the thunderstorms and torrential rain made us decide to just hang here and drink and eat!  We were pleasantly surprised.  I had the Chicken Carbonnara and it was very good...the sauce was creamy, nice cherry tomatoes outlining the dish and lots of perfectly seasoned grilled chicken.  The spinach dip and the colorful and warm tortillas were a great appetizer.  One party member had the chicken pot pie and liked it lots.  It came out in an individual shallow crock with a handmade crust and a delicious gravy according to the person eating it.  My husband had the Calabash chicken and it was hot, crispy and abundant.  Beer choices were very limited, there was not much on draft, and they had eliminated serving Blue Moon.....bad idea folks!   The staff was continually friendly and helpful, even after a beer tipping over, that spilled into the appetizers.  We needed plenty of towels to pick up the New Orleans sized beer spill, and the staff was really cool about it.  They even came back with a whole new appetizer and didn't charge for it.  Another good thing at Fatz is the food is reasonably priced!  So if you are in the nabe, stop in at Fatz Cafe and enjoy the quick service and the good food."}
{"text":"The most awful dining experience I have ever had. I don't know how they stay in business their food is run of the mill fried nasty crap.. The service is horrendous ... We asked for bottled water they looked at us like we were crazy then brought out some old ass half crumpled up cheap crap in the bottle with no glass... We are always nice to servers but this chick was awful she was rude , inattentive and she brought out  the check as soon as she dropped off our entree it was ridiculous ... After being in the service industry for many years I was appalled by this place.... If I could rate it a negative star I would..... I never tip less than at least around 25% as I know what it's like to live on a low salary like that , but this was the first shitty tip I have left in my life and it was well deserved....  DONT GO THERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE VERY DISAPPOINTED..."}
{"text":"Dateline, Saturday lunchtime and I'm in the area.  I have eaten at many Fatz's throughout the Southeast and figured I'd stop in for a bite.    I'll get the service aspect out of the way, always excellent.  Prompt, courteous and they don't hover.  Drinks stayed full and our server was very friendly.  The food was meh.  Nothing special, but not terrible either.  I had the \"seabreeze\" spinach salad with chicken and warm bacon dressing.  It arrived exactly as described on the menu with the \"new age\" stuff to put on salads these days i.e. candied pecans, cranberries etc...and it was good.  One of the drawbacks of going somewhere for such a long time, and many locations at that is you can see the degradation of the quality of what they're serving.  My wife had the calabash shrimp which used to be fairly decent size shrimp that at least tried to be fresh and plump.  What we got yesterday was no different than Long John Silvers....small, overly fried and iodine tasting.  My little one got the calabash tenders which are nothing different than the tenders you get somewhere like Chic Fil A.  They do a great job of promoting it as something different, but it's not.  For the money, Fatz is overpriced IMO.  When you have a regional chain like this you need to do something extraordinary to set yourself apart.  Fatz misses this mark."}
{"text":"Service is terrible had to ask for our salads food came 2 mins latter were is the manager this used to be a great place"}
{"text":"Fatz is a standard American chain cafe, that does a few things better than most.  I have been enjoying their food for several years.  My favorite dinner at these establishments is their Blackened Fish Sandwich.  This is a white fish with mild blackening, served on a toasted and buttered bun.  For a chain like this, it is quite good and filling.  The sandwich comes, generally, with French fries that are acceptable.  Nothing outstanding here.  Service is always pretty good,with friendly waiters and waitresses.  This particular Fatz fits all of the above criteria."}
{"text":"My experience with this Fatz the other day was mostly good.  Actually parts of the experience were outstanding so you'll probably wonder why the 3 star rating.  Well read on..  A group of us from work ended up here.  Service was exceptional.  All of the staff was friendly and accommodating.  Our server even gave recommendations on salad dressings, soups, etc.  Like most restaurants these days, Fatz seems to change their menu often which keeps things fresh.   I ended up with the turkey burger, a cup of the vegetable beef soup, and fries.  The soup was ok. It is apparently homemade because I noticed a few of the carrots were not completly cooked.  The broth also was kind of bland.  The turkey burger came out and it the burger was twice the size of the bun.  It looked strange.  Not sure what happened there.  It was ok as well.  The fries were very good.  Big thickly cut fries almost along the lines of a steak fry but not that big.    So overall a decent meal.  The problem came when I got back to the office.  15 minutes later I was in the bathroom for almost an hour.  I'm not sure what made me sick but it was definitely lunch.  I'm thinking it was the Turkey burger because something about it just didn't seem right.  The decor of this restaurant is simple with photographs of area attractions displayed on every wall - from NASCAR to Carowinds to some of the office buildings.  Very tasteful.   But I don't think I'll be coming back here for a while.  But I will say this..the service really made an impression on me here this time around.  I would give them 5 stars for the service, 4, for the decor, 2 for the food and average it out to the 3."}
{"text":"The food was great!!! The pimento cheese skillet is sooo yummy!!! The chicken, shrimp and ribs are the bomb!!!Yasin, our server was the best!!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was fine but the decor and ambiance were nothing special. There is both dining and bar seating. They were able to accommodate our large party of 12 very quickly. The service was quick and friendly.   Food portions are huge so come hungry! Even the side salad that's comes with the entree is like a meal in itself. The rolls with cinnamon butter taste like fried dough and were warm and delicious. Cajun fire stick appetizer was good. They are famous for their ribs and chicken. My husband had the ribs and said they were good and worth getting if hungry for ribs. The calabash chicken was very tender and flavorful with a crunchy breading exterior.   Overall I would recommend this place to others and would return if I am in the area."}
{"text":"We enjoy FATZ and have frequented the establishment a handful of times. The chicken tenders are off the hook and their burgers are phenomenal (according to the fiance). My daughter loves the potato soup and most of their appetizers.   Next trip I will partake in the all-you-can-eat ribs. The service has always been excellent and that's why I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I went there today for dinner after a long day at Carowinds.  The hostess asked us when we entered if we had ever been there. We haven't.  The manager brought us a free sample of there calabas chicken ....yummy!!! Jack was our server. I must say he was probably the best server ever!!! The food was amazing!! Fresh! We had the fried green tomato appitizer and a combo app. All the food was great."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to go to dinner together for the first time in 4 months. We chose to go here because we love the food.   Our waitress came up to us asked us our drink order I asked for straws she never came back with straws.  We ordered an appetizer that never came out. Once I got my burger I asked for \"without Pickles or mayonnaise or chilli.\" Our meals came out my husband started to eat because the burger I got had mayonnaise and chilli. I asked for a new bun and twenty minutes later I had a brand new burger and my husband was done eating.  We addressed the issue to the manager he said thank you I'm sorry and that was it.   So we paid for the dinner we never really had together"}
{"text":"We received excellent service at Fatz! Our server was very attentive and friendly. I got the Parmesan crusted fish and the mashed potatoes, neither of which I was a fan of. But I've had many other things there I have liked. My husband got a burger, which he said was very good. The rolls were great. I'd go back, but I just wouldn't order the fish or mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"No please don't do it to yourself baby shit under the booth absolutely disfuckinggusting enuff said and why can't they just bring out the complimentary hot butter biscuits and get servers who give a damn about their hygiene Jesus christ"}
{"text":"We love it!  We actually ate at Fatz' the first day we moved into the neighborhood. We wanted to take the friends and family members who helped us with the move out for a nice meal. It was great. We too were offered platters of the calabash chicken for being first time customers. Service is great, quick and friendly, and everything is good. I love the chicken pot pie."}
{"text":"I am not surprised by the amount of stars FATZ has but I am surprised and how hard people are slamming it. Is it generic, yes. Is it a chain, yes. is it predictable, yes. Is it bad, no! FATZ is not bad compared to other chains (especially Applebee's which is just an insult to the restaurant industry).  We live within walking distance of FATZ and I wish I could saw I crave them more often but I don't. We go because it's there and we get tired of the Tilted Kilt's (recently) sub-par food.  We go because the first time we went it was nice and Becky and I had a nice quiet dinner. That first time too we ordered the Bloody Mary which came garnished with a shrimp.  Our last visit, over the weekend, was out of boredom and not wanting to drive anywhere. The service was nice and professional as every other time we've been and the food came out within normal expectations.  We ordered the Cajun Firecracker Sticks which were excellent but I wish they were a little crisper. The Onyum sauce goes really well with the appetizer. The portion is huge and we were pretty half-way full by the time the two of us finished this appetizer.  Becky ordered the crab cakes with coleslaw and the house salad. The whole dish was good enough. I had a bite of her crabcake and it tasted like crabcake. The coleslaw was a little bland but you could still detect some nice sweetness.  I had the Calabash chicken with the Greek salad and a loaded baked potato. I like their Calabash breading and the loaded baked potato was good. At this point I was pretty full so I barely even touched my salad which looked and tasted pretty generic.  Here's the biggest gripe, which is really not that big. We go for the Bloody Mary, not because it's the best, but because it's a fond memory of the first time we went and the shrimp used as garnishment is the glue. We both ordered Bloody Marys and they came without a shrimp. That knocked off half a star... If Yelp allowed half stars. But since they don't it didn't affect it much.  And then there's the little bread basket with cinnamon butter. Need I say more?!  We will definitely go back.  P.S. to FATZ: Keep the shrimp in the Bloody Mary. P.P.S. to FATZ:  If you do keep the shrimp in the Bloody Mary, make sure it's cold."}
{"text":"The salad wasn't that good , the wings were excellent ! The manager here was a asshole though was one wing from finishing  my meal came to my table and asked me to move my truck and 14 foot trailer and wanted me to do so right then I asked him why his reply was so that his lunch costumers didn't have to walk from the back of the building like I had to do ! No I get I drive a truck with a long trailer and so one but it's not very polite to treat a guest at his restaurant like that all I can say I should go further with this but I'll let it die here if this were the old days we would have taken it to the streets ! And yes I did tip seirra was great there maybe she should be in charge there !"}
{"text":"Our food was excellent tonight.  I got the peach glazed chicken.  My son got the blackened pasta.  The wife ordered the Cali-bash grilled chicken sandwich.  We all enjoyed our meal and  the rolls are always good.  Our server was nice and efficient.  She helped us make our decisions with her knowledge of the menu.  She made suggestions and told us what her favorite offerings were.  It took a longer than it should to receive our food.  Our server kept our beverages filled.  The dining area looked clean but I kept pondering the cleanliness of the restaurant after seeing the posted sanitation grade in the lobby.  The posted sanitation grade was a 92.5.  It should be higher than that."}
{"text":"I called for a take out. They told me it would be about 20 mins but 45 mins later my food still isn't ready. It wasn't busy in the restaurant and my order wasn't anything difficult. I've been here a couple of times and every time it would take forever for me to get my food, busy or not. I'm on my lunch break. I don't have almost an hour to wait for my food. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"As many times as I've drove past Fatz  over the years, today was my 1st time actually visiting. I was with some friends who frequent the restaurant, seemed more for their bread and butter than anything, but I agreed to stop in. The place was dead, we were the only customers dining. So I was worried. We were seated immediately and our waitress was great. She memorized our orders and kept the bread & drink refills coming. I ordered the Sampler which consisted of the Ribs, Shrimp & the chicken they are known for. Though I subbed for grilled shrimp. When my food arrived my side of Brocolli was cooked a bit under and bland so our waitress suggested garlic butter which definitely helped. Everything else was delicious. The ribs fell off the bones. We loved the bourbon BBQ sauce on them. The chicken was also tasty and crunchy. While we dined we witnessed a waitress in the restroom and out in the service area crying and an argument involving a different waitress. I guess since no one was really there they didn't feel they had to act professional. All in all the food was good and I loooooved the bread and butter so I would definitely return to Fatz."}
