{"text":"Don't get takeout from here. Overpriced, you don't get nearly the same amount of food or quality as other local Mexican restaurants. Food was cold by the time we brought home.  This was our second (and last) experience feeling this way."}
{"text":"First time customers who have lived in Southern California for the last 20+ years.  We've been searching for a Mexican restaurant that even comes close to  the Mexican restaurants we've come to love in California.  El Pastor is it right here in Avon, Ohio.  Nice, bright little restaurant with a bar.  Very friendly helpful servers. Food was fabulous and made to order; very fresh.  Our table tried everything from  the combo to chimichangas to the burro las cazuelas and everyone was very pleased with their meals.  We'll be back often."}
{"text":"This restaurant opened about couple months ago, and seems to be very popular. I  got a steak quesadilla and it was very good. The meat was tender and had a lot of flavor. The service was good, unlike the other review. However the restaurant needs music. Overall, I thought my experience was great!"}
{"text":"Casual grill setting. High quality food and great service. They have one of the best vegetarian fajitas I've found.  A great stop on the way or a destination in itself.  Suzy, the manager is delightful and personable.  This is authentic Mexican though it has the American twist most are looking for. If you are looking for the more authentic flavors, especially carnitas, you'll be in the right place here too."}
{"text":"The food has always been excellent from the beginning where the service was lacking at first. Irregardless we came back and the food was still delicious but the service was now incredible! It is our new favorite Mexican down the street and we've been there enough where they know us. 
The white queso is so good along with their salsa and fresh chips. My husband is a loyal fajitas man and I live the flautas (chicken is my preference). Give it a try!"}
{"text":"New Mexican place that recently opened. Not sure if they're really as bad as we experienced or they're just not good at restauranting yet. They have a small diningroom and it was packed due to it being new. We sat at the bar which was fine except the bartender didn't speak a word to us until right before we left and the waitress left us for a long time before even bringing chips and salsa and then another long wait to take our order. Ok, they're new. The chips had a funny aftertaste and the salsa wasn't really very good. The couple next to us gave me their mole negro because they didn't want it and it was pretty bad. 

We ordered frozen margaritas and they didn't have much flavor. Or alcohol. I'm pretty sure my BAC was lower when I left than when I went in. And after a while it kinda just separated into a lump of ice surrounded by not so good liquid.

When we finally got our food it wasn't much of an improvement. I ordered beef chimichungas but got chicken. They were ok, I've had worse. My girlfriend got pollo loco which included a flat, dry, hard to eat chicken breast. She liked the refried beans, I thought they tasted canned. I thought the rice was decent, she didn't care for it.

Service was very slow and we barely saw our waitress at all. Never once checked to see how things were or if we needed anything. The bartender was behind the bar the whole time and never once asked if we needed anything or wanted another drink. He only spoke near the very end and offered to take my plate when I was done. It took a while after that until someone noticed we wanted our check.

Overall, not a very good experience. I expect slower service when a place is very busy and if they're new but it seemed like they really weren't ready for the public and frankly I didn't see much effort. I do think I'll give them another try in a few months and see if there's improvement."}
{"text":"I love hole in the wall restaurants and good service.  The first thing that I noticed was that the bar was well stocked with premium liquors, the restaurant was clean, and it had a warm \"hole in the wall\" feel.  The service was prompt and I noticed that the chips were warm and the salsa tasted fresh.  I ordered camerones a la Diabla (shrimp of the devil) and asked for them extra hot.  The challenge is always how vinegary the final product comes out when extra hot.  It was perfectly balanced and there were three extra hot sauces on the table for me to fine tune it even further.  I asked for some fresh cilantro when the meal came out and the waitress quickly returned with a fresh bowl for me.  The tortillas were hot, fresh, and tasted homemade and my tip meter, my glass, was always full.  I could tell that the shrimp were frozen and not fresh, but that is expected this time of year and at this price point.  I had a fantastic meal and highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"2nd time here, the first trip around was much better than this one I'm afraid. The food was good and I will be back. I stopped after a long day on my way to my hotel and sat at the empty bar that had not been cleaned thoroughly so I had to move down. This is a fairly new  Mexican grill with great food I hope you read this and pay better attention to detail. Great food I look forward to my next visit and up my rating for you."}
{"text":"BRING BACK HELEN AND KAL'S
This place is wack, yo. 
No, but seriously. We came for Cinco de Mayo, and yes we expected it to be busy. But we waited for 3 hours for our meal after we sat down. All the while other people were in and out. We had to ask our sever for water and to take our order.
This place won't last."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Thursday night...place was pretty busy, but the dining room is relatively small.  We were seated at a large table pretty quickly, fortunately.

Service - fine, although my request for no sour cream with my meal was not executed.  The issue was fixed immediately once I brought it to the servers attention, though.

Food - it tasted fine, but the portion size of my meal (chimichangas) was embarrassingly small.  To their credit, the special that night was $1 hard shell beef tacos, and they were pretty good.  In retrospect, we should've ordered tacos for the table.

Price - biggest problem.  At least $2 more for each meal compared to other restaurants.  What should've been a $50 meal was around $70 (after tip).

We've had better in the area, so we won't be back."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the margaritas (frozen peach and on-the-rocks classic) and food (Choriqueso to start, fajitas and Burro las Cazuelas for entrees). Service was excellent! The restaurant is clean, though the dining area is very small. We'll be back!"}
