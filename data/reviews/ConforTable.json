{"text":"C'est pas tout à fait le type de bar ou j'aime aller mais ça vaut quand même la peine de découvrir. C'est un endroit sympa pour prendre des verres. Le cocktail à rhum et mangue est plutôt pas mal, le choix d'appetizers est intéressants. Pas trop bruyant. Verdun se dote encore d'un nouveau bar! Pas mal #Verdunluv."}
{"text":"Very good food, great value for the money.  Drink prices are decent too.  Staff are quite attentive.  Quality and location are on point, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were delicious, service was decent.  My boyfriend and I ordered vodka cranberries (because the cocktails were too expensive) and one order of poutine to share. The poutine was AMAZING and we ate it very quickly. The gravy was to die for. The cocktails were also very good, and pretty strong!  The restaurant was fairly empty when we were there, and so we felt it was an unnecessarily long wait for the check. In the time it took to order and eat, we waited about the same amount of time to get the check (about 15 minutes). Not detrimental, but noticeable given the fact that it was not busy.  Expensive drinks and food, but very yummy!"}
{"text":"Went there for a birthday. The drinks were great and the food was absolutely delicious. The staff were friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Un autre bon petit resto de quartier à Verdun. Parfait pour le vendredi soir. Un bon choix de bière en fût. Une approche original côté menu. Le poulet frit sur gaufres à essayer, excellente panure, cuit dans une huile de bonne qualité. Les frites maison avec leur touche de BBQ sont un incontournable. À souligner aussi, le décor, l'éclairage et l'ambiance sonore."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came in here after our other Verdun brunch place was full. There weren't very many people in there, but the décors was nice and the staff friendly. When we got the food I was completely shocked at how incredible the food was. I had the poutine and there was such a perfect mix of savory flavors, along with the hollandaise sauce and there was something tangy and very subtly sweet. I really didn't think that that combination of flavors would taste so good together. I can't remember what my friends got but I tried everything and decided the perfection of my dish was not an anomaly. Whoever they have in the kitchen or making their recipes is wonderful. There was a lot of love that went into this place. Bravo. Next time I'm going to see if their mixed drinks are this good."}
{"text":"Limited menu The food was good but a little pricey but worth it Mac and cheese balls were good starter Hamburger was good especially with the fried pickle   Fish taco was good but should have come with a side dish included The cornbread is not worth the $4  The had the nerve to charge $2 for a thimble of BBQ sauce for the hamburger which was terrible The sweet potato desert was great They need to up there game and stop being petty We will give them another try"}
{"text":"I don't know. It's hard to write this review. The staff is incredibly friendly and want to do good. But it took a rather long time to get our order in, and then an good 30 minutes to receive our food. My chicken and waffles were bland, the quantity of the chicken was so small, and the size of the waffles resembled more of a crepe. Having had phenomenal chicken and waffles for a similar price at a bar nearby, I was disappointed. My boyfriend ordered a special Mac n cheese poutine which came to the table luke warm. The staff gave us a discount on the bill due to our waiting time which was highly appreciated. But personally, I will not be returning to this location any time soon. I do wish this resto-bar great success however as the staff is very excellent and kind."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! We went for brunch on a Sunday morning (Yelp hours might not be updated) they have unlimited mimosas and ceaser. They also have sumersby on tap!!   We were torn between what to order so ended up ordering three different plates to share while expecting to bring some left overs home. Wrong everything was so good we couldn't stop eating   We ordered the breakfast Poutine, The daily special, which was eggs Benedict with pork belly and heurveros rancheros on a bagel.  Everything has a nice spicy kick to it and was really good!!  My only thing was I would of loved if the breakfast Poutine had hollandaise sauce on it, but that's just me whose obsessed. (See pictures of meals!)  The décor is really nice and inviting. definitely excited to try their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Nice new spot to eat and drink in Verdun! Great drinks (pomme sweet pomme is delicious, had to order more than one!) And great comfort food. Nice veal poutine, and the chicken and waffles were tasty too! Been back twice since it opened, would totally recommend!"}
