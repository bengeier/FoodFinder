{"text":"Solid 4.5 stars for this Afghan eatery. It's easiest to think of Afghan food as a cross between Persian and Indian, with dumplings thrown in. For under $50 we had a meat patty and tomato casserole with eggs, pilaf with super tender lamb, naan, and a large plate of beef dumplings topped with thick yogurt and herbed lentils. We were really hungry, but we still had leftovers to take home. All of the dishes had many layers of herbaceous flavor, were well seasoned salt-wise, and the very hot chutney provided could be doled out as we saw fit. The only reason this doesn't get five stars is because they did not have the Afghan leek flat bread that we were looking forward to, and that it's hard to find. Decour is fairly minimal, but the place is clean and modern, if somewhat small. The TV on the wall blares a constant YouTube stream of Persian, Lebanese and Afghan music videos. Come here for the great food, not a romantic or classy exotic atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm from Vancouver and I'm in town for business, I tried this restaurant as I really enjoy the afghani restaurants we have in Vancouver . Food was different I ordered the lamb shank qabeli Palau and a mix of kebabs. Very expensive for the portion , taste was decent but very oily, chicken tikka was marinated in just turmeric and oil not much else. I'm not sure if this is authentic Afghan Food as the ones in Vancouver are much different and much tastier. Only thing I enjoyed was the beef kebab"}
{"text":"Had the chicken tikka kebab with rice and potato curry.  Plentiful portion at a reasonable price - and very delicious.  Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Terrible buffet ! Ridiculous behavior and was left unsatisfied! We went for a buffet for Iftar and none of the items were refilled!!"}
