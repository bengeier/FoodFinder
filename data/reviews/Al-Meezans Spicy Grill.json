{"text":"Great afghan food which is bound to have you coming back for more. The food was impeccable and the service was as friendly as can be."}
{"text":"Ordered Sultani Kebab, took about 20 mins to prepare I was the only person there. The portion sizes were small compared to a other Afghan places but prices are smaller as well, however, the quantity is satisfying. Meat was flavoured well. I think the rice was basmati, it was a little wet and sticky but flavoured decently. Bread was mediocre, the place was relatively clean but nothing special with regards to ambience.   Conclusion: decent place with decent food, meat is good and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"When the restaurant gets in more than 3 people,  things get chaotic.  They need staff that can handle more customers.  Food was OK, but it was better when there wasn't a lunch time rush."}
{"text":"As the other poster mentioned, the shawarma here is rather dry, and to be quite frank- terrible. However, there is a bright spot, the spicy chicken tikka wrap! It's just over a dollar more, but it's better than any chicken shawarma I've ever had. Be prepared to wait about 10 min for it though as the chicken tikka is specially prepared for each order"}
{"text":"Had the beef kabob plate. With rice and salad. It was fresh and made to order. They fire bar b que  the beef.  So it was delicious. The price was under $10. I highly recommend. Will come back and order this dish again."}
{"text":"Food is great! Staff is super friendly and willing to make any accommodations. However it takes a while for the food to be made, but it's good because it always tastes fresh."}
{"text":"I had their spicy chicken tikka dinner and it was GREAT!!  It was grilled to perfection and the price was fair for their quality of food and it even came with their home made bread like how it's suppose to!!!  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, did take 10 minutes but was worth the wait. The chicken was juicy and well cooked. The salad aaaazing"}
{"text":"Ordered shawarma from this place twice, and each time it was dry, salty and almost an insult to shawarma. For Al-meezans to win my heart over, they'll need to order better groceries, offer moist chicken/beef/pork and really take a lesson on how to create shawarma that tastes like shawarma."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken shawarma plate and they gave us the wrong order. On top of that, food took forever to come out and was very mediocre. I don't understand how they can be so confused about running a business. One girl in particular had no idea what she was doing. Pass on this place."}
{"text":"Very bad experience here. Walked in to see young children walking around the kitchen and behind the counter / grill area. My chicken shwarma was a mix of great tasting chicken and burnt / dry chicken. I definitely won't come back to this place and won't recommended it it to anyone. Do yourself a favour and avoid this spot."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. CHICKEN is always too dry and doesnt taste fresh at all.  When they first opened up, place was always busy.  Now its empty all the time & i guess its because of the quality of food.    Service is pretty slow.  Takes a while to get your food, even if you are the only people inside."}
{"text":"Do not go here! My fianc√©e and I got food poisoning from eating a simple shawarma wrap."}
