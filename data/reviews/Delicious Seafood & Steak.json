{"text":"The food is amazing! For those of you who might not enjoy the phenomenal fish soup hot pot there are also a variety of other Hong Kong styled items that are delicious as well like their tasty sandwiches and curries. The portions are rather large and in my opinion pretty worth it for their price. The only thing though, customer service could've been better, even on the days when business is running slow."}
{"text":"This used to be a fish soup place and they expanded their menu to include Hong Kong style meal plus hotpot. We came for fish soup hotpot (not AYCE) and was not disappointed. Soupbase was good, but at the end it would lose the fish taste. Love the stewed intestine and lamb, and don't forget to ask for the red onion sauce. Keep in mind that unlike other hotpot places, they do not provide a good selection of sauces."}
{"text":"I am glad this place re-opened, again.  The menu is a mixture of Hong Kong style cafe food, and select-your-own-ingredient soup noodles and hot pot dishes that feature their famous homemade fish stock.  

There is a grand re-opening 50% off special that ran for about a week or so.  We deliberately waited until this period is over to give it a try.  The place is still packed on a Saturday night; a short waiting line formed after around 7:00pm.  Happy to report that the fish soup is still very good; its a thick broth with smooth and well rounded flavour, and none of the unpleasant fishy smell.  

Maybe I will order from the HK cafe menu next time."}
{"text":"What a bowl of soup!  A late lunch break had me looking for a new place to try.  Aside from the menu, I was presented with a sheet of \"do it yourself\" soup options.  Choose your broth, from fish, beef chicken, curry and a few others.  Next, choose your noodle from Japanese ramen, vermicelli, thin vermicelli, and several others.  Finally, choose your extra proteins.  

I wanted the curry, but to \"test\" I stuck with chicken broth. I selected the Japanese ramen and then topped it with some beef brisket and wontons.  This is the $5.95 option, but I could add more toppings for a small up charge.  

My first taste was to see if the broth was too salty, or too watery--it was PERFECT! Rich, solid flavour, I could have poured it in a mug and drank it!  The noodles were fresh and tasty.  The toppings were right in line.  I noticed that there were a few other ingredients--a couple of mushrooms, a piece of crab stick and a nice chunk of bean curd sheet (foo juk).

This is a hot pot restaurant, so all of the tables have inductive heaters in the top for cooking at your table--a great social event.  I need to try that the next time I have a group together.

Next time I am going to add an extra topping or two just to really get over the top and see if I can break $10.  But I am still eyeing that curry.  We'll see if I can add another star..."}
