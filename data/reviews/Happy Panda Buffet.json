{"text":"Great place all you can eat, be sure to leave home hungry for best results...and also don't fill up on too much water...the waiter(s) don't hesitate to fill your glass back up."}
{"text":"This is no longer Happy Panda Buffet. Now it's called Dragon Handroll, and is an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant plus Chinese buffet. It's also no longer inexpensive, at $20.99 for an adult dinner.  The food was good; decor was interesting, parking abundant and service was good."}
{"text":"Garbage,unless u have no taste buds, like Kramer on Seinfeld in that one episode withe the peaches after going into Jerry's apartment when it was being fumigated  Not worth a free admission"}
{"text":"An average \"chinese buffet\" place, even on holidays you get lunch buffet at sub $10 price ($1.99 to $9.99 depending on your age), and dinner at sub $15.  Nice interior and food is okay... felt like low cost imitation of Mandarin, though not enough variety as the big brother ;-)"}
{"text":"def. a good place to eat in. I always go here at least once a month and sometimes call for a delivery once / twice a month.. I love their baby short ribs wth blck pepper sauce ;)"}
{"text":"COCKROACHES! There was one on the table and one on the sushi table! omg ew. and no one cleans the bathroom. its DISGUSTING"}
{"text":"NEVER GO HERE!!!!   Worse buffet experience of my life!!! It was cheap sure, but still not worth it. The food tasted horrible, was either overly dry or greasy and had obviously been sitting out for far too long or been reheated. It's the one and only time in my life that i didn't even eat one plate at an all you can eat and also the first time I seriously considered getting up and just walking out without paying (my far too honest boyfriend wouldn't let me...). And the regret of this place followed me through the night and into the next day. I think this is one time that you don't actually want the full details of the experience but let me just say I would never wish food poisoning on my worse enemy!!!   The only good thing was the decor/cleanliness of bathrooms. And my standards are pretty low in that department for this kind of resturant, so thats not really saying much.    Spend the extra couple of bucks and go down the road to the Imperial Buffet or Mandarin....If you could give minus stars I would...."}

{"text":"Definitely one of the best-valued Chinese buffet restaurants in Toronto!  A fun and filling dining experience for everyone who enjoys classic Cantonese + Szechuan feasts. Seriously. The selection, for the price, is fantastic.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the decor that welcomes guests is such a treat, especially for kids - bamboo trees, panda bears, ancient Ming-style wood and stone, little lanterns, parasols on the ceiling - fun!    Food:  if you and your guests arrive early (6pm or so), the offerings are so fresh & delicious!  On offer: lo mein, satay beef, chili chicken, lemon chicken, different fish & shrimp dishes, fried & steamed rice, chicken balls, calamari rings, dim sum (great har gow!), sushi, 3 types of soups (wonton, hot & sour, and vegetable), and much more!  The desserts consist of almond cookies, ice cream, cheese cake, and a few other pastries.    Service:  always gracious, accomodating, prompt, and professional.  Will continue to be a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"For the price, I find it good.  Decor is nice, service was okay, and no complaints about the food.  Tuesdays they have a $10 dinner buffet special.  Yeah, it's not a huge place and there isn't as much choice as you'd find at a place like Mandarin, but that doesn't bother me. I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Bland and buffet items sitting out a long time.  The place appears closed and now a new sign is up in it's place."}
{"text":"This restaurant location at Brimley and Eglinton was totally cursed before Happy Panda moved in. First there was a Kenny Rogers restaurant (does anyone remember those?), then a series of Asian buffets that all went out of business within months, and then Happy Panda.  I'm pretty sure Happy Panda is a chain of buffets, but this was my only experience with the chain. What drew us in originally was that the place is CHEAP. I believe it was $8 for an all-you-can-eat buffet with Chinese food, Dim Sum, Thai food, and all sorts of other stuff.  The interior of this place is surprisingly nice. They have stylish chairs, glass tables and really clean bathrooms. The floors are an uneven stone brick, which meant I tripped at least four times heading up to the buffet.  The buffet looked nice, and I was into it at first...until I ate the food. Obviously, I went for the Dim Sum first, because who doesn't love Dim Sum? I grabbed the Har Gow (shrimp dumplings)...and they had MAYO in them. Ew. The BBQ pork buns were OK, but honestly, the Dim Sum all tasted worse than the frozen stuff I can get at the grocery store.  The rest of the food was typical buffet fare -- greasy, sitting under a heat lamp all day, bland, overly salty junk. My arteries were so angry at me for clogging them with this crap that didn't even taste good.  So while Happy Panda may try to lure you in with their cheap buffet, don't be fooled. If you've only ever had Chinese food from Mandarin in your life, you might like it here. But if you know how delicious Dim Sum and Chinese food should be, Happy Panda will not leave you feeling very happy."}
