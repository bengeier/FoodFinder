{"text":"This place is terrible. Overpriced, bland, skimpy menu selection, and mediocre service. I can't believe the previous reviewers  who gave 4/5 stars actually ate at this place."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!

Mixed grill and mixed appetizer were amazing.

The meats that came with the mixed grill were so flavorful and delicious.  It came with chicken, beef, lamb/beef gyro meat, and lamb/beef kebab type thing..  really good.

The hummus and tabouli and others in the mixed app were really tasty as well...and the pita was soft warm and delicious.

Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We dropped in on a weeknight to give it a try and days later I'm still obsessed with how delicious it was. We started with the mixed grill as suggested by Kevin G and he is so right about the mix of flavors and textures. My entree was the chicken kebabs and it's hard for me to describe just how amazing they were.  I'm not trying to over-hype, but I can't get those chunks of flavorful, succulent meat out of my mind.  My finance felt the same way about his mixed grill kebabs (lamb, adana, gyro and chicken).

Usually baklava does nothing for me. I mean, I've even had it hand-rolled by little old Greek ladies and wondered why bother. Since Dervish makes theirs in-house, we decided we must try it because if it was going to be good anywhere, it would be here. They did not disappoint; the top was flaky but the bottom was moist and sweetly decadent. Loved it.

Some previous reviewers said the staff was awkward but we thought they were friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our lunch very much!  It was slow, and the service was very attentive. Food was prepared very well, wonderful ingredients, fresh!!
We will be back!"}
{"text":"The baba is really great, light & smoky.  The bread is wonderful and all the food we've tried was well prepared. The lamb with yogurt is next on my list. The decor is very nice and the people there are very friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious Mediterranean Cuisine at a very very affordable price 
Location_ Avon, OH. At the end (beginning) of the small shopping center. Nice size parking lot. Two gas stations with in 1 minute drive.
Ambiance _ nothing fancy. big dinning room with simple decor. plenty of elbow room. nice photos of various locations in Turkey (I think). Good lighting. Kids friendly so can be noisy. 
Food_ yummy!!!! DELICIOUS!!! Have dinned at this place 3 times and always a 5 stats when it comes to food.Warm bread with spicy and yogurt based dip (very refreshing) is a great start to a meal. Mixed Grill dish is fantastic (can request to substitute certain meats for chicken or vice verse). Beef, Lamb, Chicken .. served over perfectly cooked rice ... no contest ... one of the best Mediterranean place I've ate at. Perfectly cooked, flavored to perfection, and meat/chicken literally melts away with each bite. Lentil soup is incredibly good. Desert ...Kunefe which is shredded phyllo dough stuffed with fresh cheese and grilled with syrup poured over top and served hot is out of this world!! Turkish coffee is a must (ask them to tell you how to read a fortune after finishing the Turkish coffee ... entertaining.)
Service _ Friendly and courteous. Would like to see just a bit more smile from some and more ... professionalism. However, the place have a very family like atmosphere so I guess service is a reflection of a relaxed ambiance of the place. 
Will certainly be back and have recommended to many friends."}
{"text":"Real honest food.  Delightful spices.  Hearty portions.  Leaving full, but not stuffed.  We found this gem on Yelp!

Other reviewers complained about service.  Ours was gracious if unpolished.  Real honest people.  

If you like food out of bags and servers with lots of bling go somewhere else.  

If you want an awesome taste treat, dine here!"}
{"text":"Best Turkish food in Cleveland area.  Better than Istanbul Grill and blows Anatolia away by far.  Delicious hidden gem -- authentic!!  Good carry-out service as well.  If this restaurant was anywhere other than by the Wal-Mart in Avon, it would be nonstop busy.  Hope they expand."}
{"text":"This place was delicious. The serice was friendly and the decore was nice as well.  Great food served in a timely manner. Also my mom had some of her food taken in a box and it tasted good later on when I heated it up."}
{"text":"Food here is fantastic, probably some of the best turkish food you can find.
I can not stand some, that are here only to spit on some of the best restaurants in Avon only because they  find it hard to be positive.
I travel from Lakewood only to enjoy their good food and the fantastic kids menu for my kids.
Kids menu is great too and the food is all kosher and fresh."}
{"text":"Where is Mehmet?  We miss him.

I was going to plan my husband's birthday party (for 50 ppl) at Dervish, but Mehmet left.  We really wanted Mehmet to help us plan it and be our spectacular server."}
{"text":"I've been interested in trying this restaurant so I purchased a Groupon. It was a terrific surprise! The food was wonderful. The bread with two dipping sauces was so good and arrived as if hot out of the oven! My husband had the vegetarian plate with hummus and falafel. I don't care for lamb so I opted for chicken shish kebab and was very happy. The chicken was so well-flavored and moist with the taste of the grill it had been cooked on. I savored every bite! Watch out for the peppers that appear on the vegetarian plate unless you enjoy a good sweat with your dinner. You can bring your own wine. If you forget there is The Wine Room just a few doors away where you can make a purchase. We will definitely return. Great service. The young men serving were very polite and attentive."}
{"text":"Being a Restaurant Manager, my expectations are always very high when dining out.  We arrived after close, the manager kept the restaurant open for us and I appreciate them being so accomodating.  The meal starts with a fresh homemade Turkish Pita bread, which was fantastic. It comes with great sauces.  The portion and quality of food was good, albeit a little bland on a few of the items.  However they can be ordered spicy, which I plan to do when I return.  The manager is a very warm and welcoming host.  We had a great time and would highly recommend this restaurant to all of my friends and family."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here a few times and each visit we've had a great experience. Tonight we decided on a takeout order of the eggplant in sauce appetizer, whole grilled fish, and the Mediterranean salad with lamb. 

Although the fish takes longer (approx. 30 minutes) it was definitely worth the wait! Plenty of flavor and definitely a lot of food. The lamb in the salad was cooked perfectly, not over or under-done. 

The servers were very polite and helpful. Overall the customer service is excellent."}
{"text":"I love this place, we eat here at least ones a month or more, the lamb is fabulous and Halal. There is no alcohol served, but you can Bring your own, or just wait till your done eating and go to the Bar on the corner of the the strip mall if you are that much of a lush. The Servers have always been friendly to me and other guest we have brought in for lunch or dinner. You can get your meal spicy or regular all you have to do is ask.
The Turkish Coffee is nice and strong, I would recommend ordering the coffee after you eat. Would recommend to all foodies looking for great middle eastern food."}
{"text":"I recently went crazy on restaurant.com and snagged a whole bunch of $25 gift certificates for $3 or something crazy cheap like that. A gift certificate for Dervish was amongst my purchases. I had never had Turkish food before, but I am open to trying anything...especially when its 2 minutes down the road from our house. 
So the deal with restaurant.com certificates is that there is normally a minimum purchase amount you have to make in order to use them. The minimum on this one was $35.  Well the menu items are so reasonably priced we needed to order a few apps in order to meet the minimum. We knew that we were going to have too much food but that is what doggie bags are for, right? So we started off with the hummus and falafel. While we were waiting for our apps the server brought a few pieces of bread in a basket which we devoured because we were starving. A few minutes later the apps were served and we noticed that there was no pita or anything to accompany the hummus. No big deal, we just motioned to our server and asked for more bread. Our servers response to us was \"are you sure?\". Huh? I told the server yes, we were sure we wanted some more bread to eat with our hummus. \"I don't want you to get too full and not eat your meals\" was his reply. What!?! Now I was getting ticked off. Before I got over the shock of his boldness he said \"I'll bring you more bread if you insist, but I won't give it to you until you have your meals\" and walked away. Seriously? Who did this guy think he was...my mother?! I was fuming. What kind of restaurant has servers that dictate what their customers can and can not have? My poor BF tried to flag down the waiter again because seriously, we wanted some damn bread, but he chose to ignore us until he delivered our meals. And true to his word he brought out more bread with the meals, but I was already done with this place. The little fight over more bread ruined the rest of the meal for me. Which is a shame because the food is pretty darn good. I previous reviewer mentioned that the service was awkward, but I think that was a huge understatement. Not only is the service awkward, but it is rude. And due to the service I received, my vist the other night will be my last."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today and can say that I will definitely be returning.  The food was great, but the ambiance was lacking a bit.  I was surprised that they do not have their liquor license, but lesson learned, I will return next time with a bottle of wine in hand."}
{"text":"Food is great but the service is awkward. The lack of cohesion in the wait staff & an evident sense of confusion is hurting the reputation of an otherwise great eatery"}
{"text":"I Drive 50 miles for the awesome food..have never been disappointed..service excellent, food always tasty and fresh..
Drink would be nice with dinner, but food more than makes up for lack of liquor...
GREAT place for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mediterranean food i've had in C-town. The sultan's delight is off the chain delicious, their grape leaves are amazing, the warm bread, the friendly service and the nice surrounding area all make Dervish a big win. The challenge is to not overorder!"}
{"text":"Tucked back within a shopping center, Dervish is a lot more than meets the eye. Great atmosphere and terrific persian cuisine. I chose to go with the Mixed Grill, due to the fact I could not make up my mind. It proved to be a wise choice. The meats are all extremely tender and very flavorful. The bread is also on point! I will be back."}
{"text":"We discovered Dervish Grill a few weeks after it had opened.  While I have eaten my share of Meditterranean food, I had never experienced authentic Turkish cuisine.  I was pleasantly surprised, to say the least.

On that first visit and each of the other times we have gone back, we started with a mixed appetizer.  The hummus, tabouli, lebni, and ezme are a great way to start the meal - the dish offers a variety of flavors and textures from light and fresh to saucy and savory that allow you to experience what makes Dervish different from other Meditterranean restaurants.  The falafel are hands down the best I have ever had; They are delicately prepared in a way that you can taste the fresh parsley and spices without the dish being overpowered by the fryer oil.  The appetizers and the fresh bread alone could make a satisfying meal, but I wouldn't stop there...

The menu offers entrees that would appeal to any palate, ranging from the simple saute dishes to more exotic house specialties.  The Lamb Adana provides a unique twist on other kebabs, and the Doner \"Gyro\" Kebab is distinctively different from similar Greek dishes.  You will find that bell peppers are prevalent in Turkish cuisine; If you appreciate their bittersweet flavor, you cannot go wrong at Dervish Grill.

The contemporary decor provides a comfortable atmosphere for a romantic dinner or a business lunch without distracting you from the food.  We have spoken with one of the owners several times.  He has always been pleasant and accommodating, and his staff provides some of the best service we have experienced without being too formal or overbearing.

I would highly recommend Dervish Turkish and Meditterranean Grill to everyone, food connoisseurs and novices alike.  If it were possible to give a restaurant 6 stars, this would be one that would get my vote."}
{"text":"I keep a Dervish menu in my car, my husbands car, magneted on the fridge and in the token kitchen junk drawer........does that tell you how I feel about Dervish???  Oh and I also have them saved in my Blackberry contacts too......enough said.

Every once in awhile I accidentally order the wrong dish for my husband  (oops!) & whatever we get ends up being his new \"favorite\" LOL - hence the reason i can't keep up!

I seriously don't think you can go wrong here in any capacity........interestingly I've never dined in but we order takeout once or twice a week."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, if I didn't live in Denver I'd be here all the time!!  I was visiting my mom out in the west suburbs and we went here for lunch last week.  The food and service were absolutely outstanding!  

The complimentary bread was awesome, almost like a soft pretzel, chewy and warm!  The cucumber-dill Labne was so good we had to ask for another side of it.  We got grape leaves for our appetizer and they were seasoned beautifully - and the pine nuts were a nice touch.  

My mom and I got the stuffed eggplant.  Seasoning was light, but well done.  The eggplant was so tender and the rice (sort of like rice pilaf with orzo) was amazing - never really enjoy rice that much but this stuff was so good I had to finish it.  My husband got the lamb and yogurt (sour like Greek yogurt) kabob and it was also very very good.   Tender and tasty.  The real star of the show was the mixed meat kabob platter.  The gyro meat was TO DIE FOR.  I hope I can go back, and I just want a whole plate of that gyro meat.  I have eaten in countless Greek and Persian restaurants, but apparently the Turks make the BEST gyro meat.  So moist, flavorful, tender, juicy, etc.  I can't even go on enough about how this is the best gyro meat ever.  GO TRY IT!

We just loved it and I'm jealous that my mom lives close by the place!  Go eat there today - they look like they need to get the word out, and it's so worth it."}
{"text":"We finally ate in here, after many memorable takeout meals. What a marvelous experience. For some reason it had escaped my notice that they do not have a liquor license, but we certainly did not miss it. My dining companions had tea, and I had an apricot juice. You can, however, BYOB. We started with the aforementioned zucchini pancake and the sigara boregi, feta and dill wrapped in phyllo. Salty goodness. We allowed ourselves to be talked into dessert, and I'm very glad we did. The rice pudding was thick and creamy, and unlike any version I've had. The start of the show was definitely the kunefe, which is shredded phyllo around fresh cheese and topped in syrup and ground pistachios. It was sweet, savory, crispy, and just out of this world. Do yourself a favor and give it a try."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious lamb kebab.  I took a 40 minute drive to check out this Mediterranean restaurant on the west side of Cleveland and was not at all disappointed.

By the waiter's recommendation I ordered the eggplant with sauce, which consists of eggplant and diced green peppers in a tomato sauce.  I usually go for the hummus or baba ghanoush when I eat at a Mediterranean restaurant, but I really liked this appetizer.  The eggplant was well cooked and the sauce had a great blend of flavors.

The lamb kebab platter was very filling, with ten large, well marinated pieces of tasty, tender lamb.  The meat was neither tough nor gamy.  Mixed with fresh cut vegetables and rice pilaf, I had no complaints about my entree.  I've definitely found the place in Cleveland for when I have any craving to eat lamb."}
{"text":"4 stars because of the good service.  If I based my review solely on the food, I probably would have given them a three.  It wasn't bad, but my lamb was tough and the bread that they serve before the meal tasted like cardboard.  Next time I'll skip the bread and try some other food.

That being said, some of the best service I have had in a long time.  My drink was never empty, and the servers were kind and thoughtful."}
{"text":"Think of Turkish food as Middle Eastern kicked up a notch-- a bit spicier, less dry, more complex. I'm thrilled that there is finally a Turkish place on this side of town. 

The food here is really fantastic. First they bring fresh bread with Labne (like tzatziki). We started with the mixed appetizer platter :Turkish baba (finely diced rather than blended eggplant), hummus, ezme (slightly spicy minced veggie spread), eggplant, Turkish (sweet) grape leaves and tabouli. All were freshly prepared and full of bright vibrant flavors-- except the Tabouli, which was dry and pretty awful. Eh, they get a pass because everything else was so good. 

Be warned that the entrees are huge! If you have 4 people, then consider getting the appetizer platter and 2 or 3 main dishes. I had the Lamb Adana with yogurt. Holy hookas, that is one of the best things I've ever eaten-- ground lamb mixed with a butter tomato sauce an yogurt served over croutons to absorb the amazing sauce. I needed a smoke after that. 

There is a kid's menu-- kabobs, some pasta, and a few other typical kid's meals. Herself had the chicken kabob with fries. She declared that it was the best chicken she ever ate. There is a choice of fries, rice and bulgar as a side. The meal includes a small bowl of ice cream. Herself chose the Turkish cherry juice as her drink-- yum! 

The service is very friendly and homey. The staff seems very happy that you are there and very willing to explain any and all the dishes."}
{"text":"First visit but won't be the last.  A nice alternative to all the other options in Avon.  Great variety of food, good service and reasonable prices.  ++"}
{"text":"Great food but service was a bit off.

We ordered Lamb Adana and Gyro with pilaf as Entree. Both were great and really flavorful. The only thing I thought was lacking was a sort of gravy/sauce to go with the rice pilaf since the pilaf was a little dry.  We had the phyllo dough and cheese dessert which I thought was Ok but my wife loved it."}
{"text":"Great spot...

Super friendly and helpful in selections.  Excellent Turkish food Had the warm phyllo-wrapped feta and dill appetizer which was light and just the right amount of dill.  Entree, had the lamb saute which as loaded with lamb, mild peppers, onions, etc. and perfect balance of spice over rice.   Dessert and Turkish coffee capped of a great meal."}
{"text":"I had lunch here recently and all the reviews before me are spot on.

Highly flavorful and refreshing food all done with outstanding service.  I had a lamb dish that was cooked perfectly.  Tender lamb with grilled veggies and rice.  Makes me want more just thinking about it.

Only suggestion I would give them is to give customers a heads up that the red sauce they serve with the bread was spicy.  I love spice so no big deal.  Had my kids been with me they would have cried."}
