{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! The atmosphere was awesome and fun. The waitstaff was so friendly and accommodating. You got your drinks and food all at a reasonable time. The price of everything was very reasonable and the portions you got were very big sized. My husband and son have a milk allergy and they had menus separate just for them of what they could eat that did not have dairy, so nice! Loved this place!"}
{"text":"The family and I stopped in for supper around 6 last night. They were pretty busy, but we were seated right away (right next to the fireplace! Huge bonus!!) and our server was there almost before our coats were off! Food was amazing! Atmosphere was cozy and fun. Service was spectacular! This was the first time we'd been here, but I can guarantee it will NOT be the last!! Great job!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Monk's in Wisconsin Dells and Middleton and always had good service and good food so I thought I would try the one in Sun Prairie. The wait was not too long even though they were very busy and they took our order rather quickly. There are a lot of tvs throughout to watch sports but not blaring too loud which is nice.

I ordered the Purple Monkey drink but it seemed sweeter than I remember. The cheese curds were very good but the waitress seemed in a hurry and only came back when we were done. I had the Chicken Caesar Wrap and my friend had the Shrimp Po Boy. The food was good so I am willing to give it another try."}
{"text":"Expensive lunch meals.  Fried pickles were good.  Waitress messed up 2 orders out of 4.  Don't think I'll return.  Asked for no cheese waitress joked extra cheese, then brought my meal with cheese.  Better places to eat in area."}
{"text":"We have eaten here in four occasions over the past several months. The food is excellent and so is the service. Consistently a top notch performer."}
{"text":"I've decided to visit this place for the second time since it opened and I really enjoyed it! The staff were really friendly and the building was super clean. If you want to burn your mouth, order the fried pickles, but after a few minutes they were really good. It took about 15 minutes to get the meal, but with the appetizers it was not bad. Overall, I would stop here again in the future! Great restaurant."}
{"text":"Our service was great. Waitress was on top of things. Food tasted great. And the bar area is awesome for sports fans."}
{"text":"So unfriendly.  Walked in today for a drink.  Though two hostesses were standing at the entrance, neither one said \"Hi\" or acknowledged that I even entered the bar.  I found a table, sat down, and a server came over with no smile on her face and asked \"What can I get ya?\"  Another unfriendly experience.  Drank my beer, paid my bill, then walked out.  As expected, the same two hostesses were standing at their stand, talking to each other, and neither said \"Goodbye\" or \"Thanks for coming.\"  Never going back there again."}
{"text":"Very good food that came out hot - not like it was sitting under a heat lamp. Fast and friendly service by the server. I will stop here again."}
{"text":"Better than Applebee's but very middle of the road. Overpriced for what you get. We will not be going here again."}
{"text":"Meh.  Pub food.  What can you say?  Everything tasty enough.  Nothing particularly great or unique.  Good in a pinch.  Good beer.  There you go."}
{"text":"Never again.

By far the worst ever experience I've had a a Monks.  

Went in on Friday after work. Ordered a \"double\" drink, but I'm guessing the only thing double in it was the amount of water added.  Drink was weaker than a popcorn fart.  However the price was strong @ $9.75.

Ordered a burger and tots.  They might as well served me ice cubes instead of tots.  Seriously, stone cold and flavorless. The tots sucked more than a Hoover vacuum convention.

The burger was just ok, nothing special.  Again, the prices was not bashful @10.99.  

So for nearly $30 after tip, I got a lousy meal and a drink weaker than a guy battleing off the flu.  I think I'll pass next time and go to Red Robin when I want a burger."}
{"text":"We just got drinks here while waiting for our friends. 

Bartender was nice and hospitable. 

They had a Happy Hour special going on where you can get a 20 oz pour for the price of a 16 oz. 

The beer list wasn't mind blowing, I think we settled with  a Fantasy Factory."}
{"text":"My food was cold and tasted terrible. Our waiter actually said he couldn't recommend any of the food on the menu as he felt it was all bad.  If the staff can't recommend one dish on the menu it can't be good. I should've left when he said nothing was good on the menu... Total waste of money."}
{"text":"Came in for the Packer game today and had a great time.  Our first bartender was Mike.  He was quick to greet and serve us.  When he left, Steven took over.  Steven provided us great service, making sure we were taken care of and enjoying our food and drinks at all times.  He also has a stellar sense of humor, which made our time even more enjoyable.  

The food came out quickly and most of what we had was delicious.  My boyfriend and I found the cheese curds to be bland, but our other items were tasty (the shrimp BLT wrap, AA breakfast burger, and nachos.  The tater tots were BOMB.).  The $5 food baskets offered during the game were a great deal and the portions were fantastic for the price.  

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is worth coming for. We had the larger sized beer and paid the 16oz price. But the food is nothing more than average. The monkey fries are terrible. The cheese gets hard before they get to you and since this is a known thing the water gave us nacho cheese.  The burgers are bland and the wings are sub par. They taste like bagged wings from target that have been fried."}
{"text":"$11+ for a grilled chicken taco salad with iceberg, a sprinkle of cheese and 2 pinky finger sized pieces of chicken??  I was going to the original Monk's when that was the 1 and only. While the original location is still pretty awesome, they have never been able to carry it over to the satellites.  Even my son's burger was par and that's their root business.  Too Bright \"cafeteria\", sporty atmosphere and clean. Unfortunately, will ride the name until people are tired of poor quality for the dollar."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Your typical bar/burger joint. Service is what you would expect from these type of joints. Their fried pickles are a must try if you like pickles! Really good and crunchy."}
{"text":"Had buffalo chicken wrap, pureed chicken that dropped out of wrap, bad consistency. Food meh and service okay, better restaurants close by"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick sit-down bite. The menu has a wide variety of American food options (burgers, salads, etc.) with a few small twists. My favorite menu item is the Bucky burger with tater tot side. The portions are pretty generous, and I do enjoy most of the wait staff. There's usually immediate seating -- I've never had to wait before, and the setting never gets too loud."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was average sports bar menu and  not my favorite. It won't be on my list of places to go.... but it was certainly not horrible"}
{"text":"We were going to see a movie at the Marcus Palace Cinema. Monk's Bar and Grill is very close so we decided to try it out. It's large, crowded, there's an extensive menu, lots of rooms, TVs, games, and a large bar. It reminds me of a TGI Fridays.

Our server was friendly and ... busy. She took our order, checked on us, was always courteous but she definitely seemed a little overwhelmed.

The food was fine: chips, wraps, sandwiches, friend cheese. Typical pub fare. A good selection of beers and cocktails. 

This is a good place to drink with friends and a convenient place to have dinner before or after a movie."}
{"text":"First time visiting Monks and we will be happy to visit again. Our server Brittany was great.  Fried pickles were a great appetizer. Our group ordered two burgers ( one very custom) the Cuban sandwich as well as fish tacos. Food was delivered hot and delicious. Both the fries and pub chips were plentiful on the orders. The only suggestion would be to improve on the fish in the fish tacos. A larger piece of fish would have made it a ten. Very nice atmosphere to dine in.  Keep doing what you're doing!!"}
{"text":"I have been to the other Monks locations so I was excited when I heard they were coming Sun Prairie.  I was not disappointed.  We each orded something different and shared. I really liked my chicken sandwich and the fish tacos were great. My husband had a breakfast burger that while not something I would normally order, was pretty good.

There really aren't many places in Sun Prairie to eat besides fast food and I can see Monks being one of our favorites. I took away a star because the dining room is packed with tables,  when full it is a tight squeeze to get around."}
{"text":"We've been to Monks in Sun Prairie several times. Great experiences, especially on the patio. Food is good, burgers are better than average, love the chicken tenders. Happy hour deals are excellent. Great local hang out."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken parmesan. Penne was overcooked to the point of being mushy. Waitress brought a second dish of penne which wasn't any better. Burgers were adequate. Felt it was overpriced for the quality."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. The breakfast burger I ordered medium came out pretty much well done. The burger itself tasted fine, but nothing exciting. The fried egg was over cooked. My wife's burger she ordered medium rare came out medium. Fries were the best part of the meal. The server was good and checked on us frequently. We came here before watching a movie, so we won't be coming back here much."}
{"text":"After eating at a monks before,  I thought the food was good but after this time - i would rate it even higher. 

I've thought of experimenting with their burger choices but made with the black bean burger patty instead [vegetarian] and was not disappointed.  The mushroom swiss was amazing. I also would like to give a nod to the fries which taste top notch."}
{"text":"I recently planned to go to Monks Bar and Grill in Sun Praire, WI. A new Cabelas store opened up today. A couple buddies and myself created a game plan to go to Cabelas and then after words go to Monks for some drinks and food. So I pull in the joining parking lot of the strip mall thats next to Monks and park on the back side between Monks and the strip mall. More towards monks to be honest. I get out of my truck and start walking when a man starts talking  towards me. He told me to move my truck. I replied why? He stated that this is parking only for Monk Bar and Grill. I replied, I see no sign. He point to a kid holding a piece of cardboard thats has written on it in marker that says no parking. I then replied no I will not move my truck. I took one step before I hear the word \"asshole\" come out of the gentlemen mouth. I turned around and asked what did you say. At this time he continued to walk and yelled out in front of all these people and my buddy \"You are an Asshole\". I replied with real nice way to speak to customers. I asked if his manager or owner would aprreciate him talking to customers that way. He relied with \"I am the owner\". I explained at that point that our plan was to go to Cabelas and my buddies and I would go to Monks after words. He said \"why didnt I explain this to him first. He continued to call me an asshole a couple more times as I walked away. One of the guys I was meeting there was walking by and asked me what that was all about. I explained what just occurred. Long story short we went to Cabelas and went some where else for food and drinks. When I returned to my vehicle, I looked around for actual signs stating parking only for Monks bar and grill. Not one to be found. The disrespect and lack of professionalism changed my mind about this being a great place for my friends and family. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"5th time here.  Nachos great! Every time I need more chips to go along with mass amounts of toppings.  Bar area doesn't have a bad seat to watch a game.  Drinks and food are at good reasonable prices.  

Once observed the ice scoop get dropped on the ground and the staff immediately emptied the entire ice bid during a packer game, clean everything and refill it with ice."}
{"text":"been twi ce. Once was a delicious lunch on the patio with a girlfriend. The second was a quick bite at the bar.

Lunch on patio consisted of buffalo chicken wrap. Our server was very nice allowing me to sub the fried chicken for grilled chicken and leave off the cheese. He was also nice to let me sub a side salad (slight upcharge) for chips or fries. We both split the fried green tomato appetizer. They were excellent.

Second time I ordered a margarita and fish tacos. Bartender made my margarita skinny for me which was very nice of him. lime juice, water, 1 drop of simple syrup, and tequila. The fish tacos came out really fast and had nice crispy shredded cabbage on them and plenty of citry sauce. Only slight gripe was that I could have done with less sauce. 

Monks is a nice addition to Sun Prairie"}
{"text":"My wife and I went in this evening for happy hour. We were sat promptly with the option of the bar or dining. Server was friendly, but not very observant. Apparently all happy hour specials are for the bar only. I understand not upgrading someone's beer in hopes of keeping the dining area calm, but the food specials should apply. That was disappointing. More disappointing was the half hearted attempt made by what appeared to be a manager asking how our apps were.

 When I brought up the fact we were displeased with not receiving the discount she simply ignored it.  It seemed as though she could care less how the service/food/experience was, and was simply stopping by the table as an obligation.  Sun Prairie has other venues with similar food and beer, service like this will continue to lose customers to local competition. Meh."}
{"text":"I feel as if giving 3 stars is a bit generous.  We stopped in for lunch today while out running some errands in Sun Prarie.  We hadn't been to a Monk's in a long time.  We were sat promptly, greeted with a smile, which sometimes sounds silly writing it but doesn't always happen.  Told the specials and away it began.  I was waffling between the Mahi Mahi fish taco, shrimp tacos, or a burger.  The waitress recommended the Mahi, saying it is awesome and a popular choice.  Yikes!!!  Some people's taste buds suck in Sun Prarie.  I thought they were a 1 star at best.  Plain Jane. I wasnt expecting Gulf Coast blackened fish tacos but at least some effort would have been nice.  These were horrible.  Flavorless fish, may not have even been hand batterd.  No seasoning at all!  Dry slaw and cabbage placed on top of them with a squirt of a Chipotle aoile sauce.  The only thing that had any flavor was the cilantro they put on top of the taco or the limes they served with them.  Tater tots came out cold.  1 stars at this point only for service and cleanliness of the place.  Cool decorated sports bar theme let me add by the way.  All badgers and local packers memorabilia.
The wife orderd an awesome burger. The Gouda Burger is a must try.  The flavors that the burger had were out of this world.  Sauteed mushrooms stacked on top of it.  Came on a nice brioche bun I believe.  This needed no ketchup or mustard.  I was jealous let me add.  I wish I had orderd that. But again her fries were saturated in grease and cold.  Not good!  But now we know whenever we decide to make it back to Monk's stick to what they do best.  BURGERS.  
3 stars is giving this place a little extra.  Could be alot better with some passion and love from employees.  They need to care about what's coming out of that kitchen at all times because you never know whos receiving that food."}
{"text":"Another greasy sports bar, same food as a Applebees, Chilis, nothing special. Dining room is very cramped definitely not enough room between tables for a high chair. Bathrooms are in the worst location right next to the kitchen and a wait station so u have wait staff coming out with food or gathering at the computer and colliding with or blocking  people trying to get in and out of the bathrooms. Bad design as is the parking lot, way too small. The soft pretzel is a nice appetizer definitely not ur normal pretzel and the service was great."}
{"text":"Ripped on the SP location in past.  Bar service and terrible experience trying to plan a group event there once.  But went there Sat. Night for dinner and was shocked and awed by service levels in the dining area!  Outstanding, accommodating, attentive!  And food came out fast and was rather good.  Next time - lets see if they upgraded bar staff...Bar staff upgraded to excellent!"}
{"text":"Street Tacos were great and service was good.  Had more kids there than expected but I didn't mind as much after a beer."}
{"text":"We have been to this monks several times and find it nice! The food is varied which makes it nice for all of the different tastes out here!
I had chicken tenders and beer battered french fries. All in all, not bad.
 The fries could have been a bit crispier and the chicken just a tad more done. It wasn't  under done. And it was about lunch time and the place was really busy for a thursday. Our waitress, Nichole, was friendly and just the right amount of attentive. Other wait staff was very friendly and the manager, Mark i think, stopped by to see that we were happy. A nice touch.
We usually meet relatives here so will continue to do so in spite of a whole lot of other eating places in the immediate area.
Place was neat and clean, including the rest rooms, although they were out of hand towels and had to use the electric, very noisy, hand dryers.
We will go back!"}
{"text":"There are too many places in the area to settle on such an awful place.  I couldn't see all the taps.  I asked the bartender for a weiss or shandy.  Something summery as it was so hot out.  Her response?  \"I don't drink beer.\"  WHAT?!  I don't care if that is true.  There is a bartender bible where you never utter those words.  

So she went to two other bartenders and they recommended an IPA to me.  Hmm, yeah no.  I was really unimpressed by their knowledge.  There is nothing there that keeps me coming back.  Also your parking lot sucks."}
{"text":"Monk's can be summed up in one word: meh.

The beer cheese dip was more processed than velveeta cheese but without the flavor. It was served with buttered, toasted rye bread, celery, and chips. Celery is a strange choice to serve with a cheese dip, the rye toast was tastier on its own and the chips were so so overly salty they were almost inedible.

Bloody Mary's had a rotten taste and beer chaser was the run of the mill light beer. Not worth the $8. 

Burgers were clearly made from a frozen patty and come one way-well done. Tater tots and fries were also frozen and overly salted. 

Service was prompt but not exactly friendly. She made sure that we had what we needed, nothing more. 

You'd be better off eating at a chain restaurant by the mall. Skip this place."}
{"text":"Overall I'm going to say a 3. 
First. Not sure why they have 3 hostesses. They're just standing around talking.
5 stars for the speed of getting our food. 
4 stars for our waitress. 
3 stats for the taste of our food. It wasn't anything special. 
2 stars for the price. Definitely over priced for what it is. 
Wouldn't ever have to come back here."}
{"text":"Food was good and large portions. I couldn't find a place to park but still got a table relatively quick. I do however agree that the tables are small and tight to the booths. 
Wasn't anything worth bragging about but I would go back again."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp po boy at $12, upgraded my side cheese curds making it a $16 lunch.  Husband gets chicken caesar wrap which he enjoys.  The offered him a dip to go with his chips, he accepted and then we got a $1 up charge on the bill we weren't warned about for what basically consisted of sour cream and French onion soup mix.  I echo what another reviewer said about the booths being real close which would be an uncomfortable experience for a person of size.  TVs played only sports, so if that is your thing, this place is for you.  I will go back, but to get my husband to go with me, he will need to owe me a favor!"}
{"text":"I came here for Lunch after an early movie across the street. The parking lot was pretty full for a restaurant that was semi busy for a packers game. 

Ordered the chicken quesadilla which was great. It came with guac for an extra $0.99. Sour cream and salsa was free. It was extra cheesy.

Then I ordered the Cuban with tots. The tots were delicious but some were over done and they were mostly salty. The Cuban was good, but the saltiness from the tots made me lose my appetite. 

This would be a great place to watch games with a bunch of family and friends. Service was excellent. I was just disappointed by the tots (which are my favorite)."}
{"text":"Due to unforeseen circumstances, my take home
box got ruined in the car, along with my dreams of eating awesome buffalo chip leftovers. 

I scoured the internet menu ahead of time so I was prepared for what awaited me. I went with the buffalo chicken chip appetizer as my meal and the kiddo chose Mac and Cheese (big surprise). We had a big party of 10 so I have no clue what everyone else ordered but everyone was happy. 

They offer vegan/vegetarian burgers as well as turkey burgers. There's something here for everyone. The buffalo chicken chips were super spicy but I am not one who can handle spice easily. However, they were still awesome. Next time is request a side of ranch just to cool down my mouth. 

My kiddo loved her white cheddar Mac and fries. Everyone else cleared the fries she had leftover because they were that awesome. Each kids meal is served on a frisbee that you get to take home. Super cool. 

We ordered a family size cheese curd that was devoured in minutes. Monk's isn't the best cuisine in the universe but it hits the spot with good bar food (burgers, wraps, wings, Mac). The Badgers/Green Bay decor fits properly here! Go Badgers!"}
{"text":"Plenty of TVs in the bar. Ice cold beer, best in area. Ordered the Ruben and it's pure quality. Will return here for sure."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken parmesan,as it was a speciality dish and it was overcooked,mushy and sweet. I have had chicken parmesan before but this was the worst of all.We also ordered fries and they were cold and limp, they were not even fresh.Pathetic food and so overpriced. I am never coming back here."}
{"text":"Overrated, stopped yesterday for a couple appetites and drinks, gin and tonic was all tonic (and I do not like strong drinks).  Appetizer was gross, waitress looked completely bored- it was all fine but I expected at least good."}
{"text":"I love their fish I've had it several times now and it was great not fishy tasting or over cooked. I always order pub chips with it for lunch very good as well. 
I love the outdoor patio with cool fire place. I would recommend giving this gem a try."}
{"text":"Monk's is always a good choice for good Wisconsin food. They have a great selection of pub style food and all of it tastes great. There is a good amount of seating as well as parking.  I did feel like their beer list could be more expansive but I was able to find something that I liked."}
{"text":"First thing, I wouldn't come here to sit down and eat at an actual table as the dining area seems cramped and lacking. Unless you like the whole closeness to strangers thing. Personally, I don't, which is why I chose to sit at the bar.

Which wasn't a bad choice considering the service I've gotten the times I've been there has been great. The bartenders we're attentive. One even talked me into food one time. And while it wasn't the greatest shrimp po boy in existence, it was serviceable as a meal considering I was eating it nowhere near Naw'lins. The cocktails I ordered were pretty good, though, I think like a lot of places, that depends on who's making 'em. 

Overall, I've had a pleasant experience at this place. The food isn't great by any means, the building seems way to small, but the service from the bar staff I received earns them an extra star. And at least one of the bartenders was experienced enough to pick up on my \"I want the bill so I can get the hell out of here\" vibe and promptly served me my tab to close out. I appreciate little things like that."}
{"text":"Loved it.  I ordered the western burger, comes with onion tangles and carnitas on top.  Huge and so delicious! My husband ordered the fish tacos and he loved them as well.  You MUST order their cheese curds as an appetizer.  Probably the best fried cheese curds I have ever had.  

I want to give a shout out for our waitress, Shelly.  She was amazing and one of the best waitresses I've ever had.  Keep up the good work, Monks.  I can't wait to come enjoy happy hour there, the drink list looks amazing! Kudos"}
{"text":"Not bad.  Never my first choice for wings asked for crispy, they were not.  They corrected but they looked at me like I was crazy.  Our server avoided our table until my new order came out.   

She appeared to be new and nervous or both!!   I will chalk this up to just a bad day for all."}
{"text":"Usually not dissatisfied. Always get food relatively quickly, always tastes fine. Great servers.

I downgraded a previous 5-star rating after having a salad, which felt like it came from McDonald's. Or rather, I would rather have had a McDonald's salad. Everything else seems fine though! Classic American food."}
{"text":"Latest review.....

I ordered the California Chicken Sandwich. Half way through It felt slimy. I looked at one end and the chicken was pink and not cooked. They took it away and the manager came and said it was their \" New Chicken\" I didn't buy it. One end completely white and the other slimy and pink. The only pink chicken Ive ever had was smoked. Unsure right now if Ill get sick but will be to the ER immediately if I get sick. Photo being uploaded of their new pink chicken.

The server was great, did an awesome job and we tipped him well.

____________________

Old review......Great Burgers!!!!! I've eaten burgers all over the world and this place would be in the top 1% of burgers. Awesome. I've been here a fee times and I've never had anything bad. The only complaint is that the restaurant wait seems to always be there. Most times I've eaten at the bar and skipped the line."}
{"text":"Not a great choice for lunch today . Giving Monk's 3 stars because restaurant was clean and server did a pretty good job. Food - not so good. Iced tea tasted very watered down. Cubano sandwich was very dry. Southwest chicken sandwich was just okay. Unfortunately the best part of the meal was the fries and onion rings. Probably will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is just above average in terms of food, location and service. However, what really puts them above and beyond is their selection!! Vegetarians need to stop here. They aren't serving up just any old bar food. They have everything from ramen to burgers to veggie burgers!

Our servers have always been wonderful the several times we've been there. They seem very open about any mistakes or anything. 

The locations cleanliness seems to be a hit or a minor miss depending on how busy they are. I think this is pretty common in most sports bars. If it's been busy, expect it to be slightly messy.

The food has always been fantastic for us as well. I get the BEYOND BURGER which is a vegan (meat free) patty. You can have the burger with vegan or vegetarian options. But my husband has tried several different items from here, and he always loves it."}
{"text":"We had Sam as our server. We enjoyed our food but the server was way too pushy, constantly checking on us....overkill. There was a group of (4) of us trying to enjoy the food, the ambience, conversation and the NFL draft before going to see a movie at the new theater. I work in food service in management and I can tell she was trying to get us out of her section so she can leave. Maybe she should've transferred her table to another server that isn't so inpatient. We would've tipped Sam MUCH better if she wasn't so pushy."}
{"text":"Monk's is a pretty standard Wisconsin bar and grill. There's Packers paraphernalia everywhere and it's generally busy.

Usually, any of the chains in the state tend to be...mmm, just fine. The food will be generally unremarkable, but edible. Not so at Monk's. I had what may be one of the best Reubens I've ever had. The balance of sauerkraut, meat, and dressing was perfect. The bread wasn't super-crispy so it didn't cut my mouth while I bite into it, and the flavors were all exactly what they should be for a Reuben. The tots were well-seasoned and almost didn't need any ketchup, but c'mon...ketchup is delicious, so they got ketchup.

My compatriots at the table all enjoyed their food, including the toddler dipping mandarin oranges into melted cheese (a true Wisconsinite, amirite?). It's very kid-friendly and there were plenty of kiddos in the restaurant enjoying their crayons and dropping stuff on the floor. (Kids, eh?)

Service was good and the food came fast! We were in and out within an hour, which is impressive. Plenty of parking at the time I was there (lunch on a Sunday), though I could see the lot getting a little crowded in the evenings.

I can see myself stopping here the next time I need to go through Sun Prairie."}
{"text":"Tried the Ruben for the first time.  Not too bad...I am partial to my own homemade Rubens but Monks at least uses real corned beef, not the thin slices lunch meat style that I have run across.  I would of liked a little more sauce on my sandwich and will probably ask for a small cup on the side if I ever order it again.  I'm getting close to going back to a plant based diet so my next review may be on their vegetarian/vegan foods.  I ordered the pup chips which came with a side of dipping sauce.  Being the adventurous type I chose the pickle and pimento.  Something different and tasty but the pickle and pimento must have been liquified into the mayo because I didn't physically see them in the sauce.  My granddaughter had the children's tacos which came home with us because she said they were too spicy.  My daughter had the Asian or Oriental chicken salad and enjoyed it.  Service was great."}
{"text":"Monk's overall is your run-of-the-mill bar/restaurant.  Their cocktail menu looks to be their focus, having many specialty drinks listed.  I had a Bloody Mary that, even with my pickiness for them, was pretty good.

The menu is very diverse, but shows nothing unique.  We had a burger, a chicken burrito, and a loaded fry appetizer.  All of it was average.  Nothing stood out in any of it, except that the meat could use more seasoning.  My fiance nailed the food perfectly when she said that it \"wasn't offensive.\"  The food elicited no emotion at all, even after a long day.  It stands to reason that they are trying to do too many things to do any of it well.

If I rated this solely on food, it would be a three. However, the server was very poor.  She was not attentive. Barely halfway through the meal, she gave us the bill without even asking if we wanted anything else. I ended up not being able to get a second drink with my meal.  We also skipped dessert and went somewhere else.  It wasn't even busy being 4pm and barely half-full.

I guess if your goal is a couple of decent cocktails, then Monk's may not be bad. For anything other than that look elsewhere. You're bound to do to something better."}
{"text":"I have given This place four try's, why can't they get it right, the service is good, but the food is H terrible! You would think that they could get a burger rightbut no! The only reason that I come here is that it's close to home. We need more restaurants in this side of SP."}
{"text":"Our experience at Monk's was pretty much what I expected after reading the Yelp! reviews: decent, not amazing, food + decent, not amazing, service.

My husband and I both ordered burgers and tots and I got a dipping sauce (extra $, which doesn't bother me, but I know not everyone feels ok about these charges). The burgers were both cooked well and had flavorful toppings. I thought the tots were good (crispy on the outside & hot inside) and the dipping sauce (spicy ranch?) was key.

Overall, the experience was satisfactory, but nothing blew our minds."}
{"text":"We met some friends for dinner there a few weeks ago and were underwhelmed. Basically it is just like the Monk's in the Dells.  We had to wait a bit for a table, so we sat in the bar area- it was crowded, but we were able to find a couple of seats at the bar plus some room for the rest of our party to stand.  Beer selection was pretty basic, but they did have New Glarus and New Belgium beers on tap.  We were then seated at a booth in the main dining room.  The booth was oddly small (we felt like we were smashed unnaturally close to the table, which made eating awkward) and the lighting in that room was overly bright and harsh, so I felt like I was eating in a fast food restaurant vs a sit-down place.  

The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't awesome, either.  The fried pickles were decent, but they are spears as opposed to chips, so they get soggy quickly. Salads and burgers were decent, but pretty much just generic bar/chain restaurant kind of food (reminiscent of Applebee's or Chiii's). So if you're looking for basic bar food, Monk's is fine, it just wouldn't be my first choice for places to eat in the area."}
{"text":"Monks can be really crowded some times but the staff stays on top of getting people in.  There was a 15 to 20 minute wait for the dining room and the host asked if we would mind sitting in the bar.  We were fine with that.  We were put in this room off the bar so it was actually better than being in the bar, it was just we were sitting at a high top versus a table.

The food is pretty consistently good.  It's not fancy and I don't think it's farm to table, but it's in a good area for a dinner before or after shopping at Costco or a movie at Marcus Palace Cinema."}
{"text":"Last Saturday was my second time to this Monk's location. I've been to the Wilderness and downtown Dells locations many other times.

The first time to the Sun Prairie location was average. It was the new place in town so everyone was trying it, and the wait was always ridiculous. It's died down a little since then, but it really depends on when you go. We were looking for an early dinner before the Badger game on this second visit, so really had no troubles getting seating.

Our service was much improved on this visit. Our waitress was great, very attentive and checked in with us often.  Food also came out quickly. We both ordered burgers with fries on the side. I had the \"It's All Gouda Burger.\" My burger was good, and I ate about half of it before having to box it for the road. We also both ordered sides of ranch for the fries. FYI they do charge for these!

All and all I would say this spot is improving. They did build it on the small side, and I'm hearing that there are already plans to build on to make it larger. I think that should have been an obvious issue when building, considering the location and that there's not much else around there for restaurants."}
{"text":"Solid burgers for normal prices. Cheese curds were adequate but nothing special. I'd recommend the basic cheese burger as its a classic that's well done. Nothing"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, bar tender and servers were nice and a nice crowd of people. I had a burger and fries that was very tasty. Good selection of cold beer and other adult beverages. I will return!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. Terrible service, charged us extra for ordering bbq sauce and  also charged us extra substitute mashed potatoes for french fries and never told us that there was going to be an extra charge. We were sitting in the booth and the tables are so close to each other people kept walking by our booth and bumping into our table."}
{"text":"Monk's is nice, but a little pricey. I love the look of their bar and their outdoor patio area. The service has always been great when I'm there and they have a pretty good selection of beer. There are TVs everywhere and has been a good place to watch a game. The only downside is that their menu is kind of pricey with very few things under $10. I really like their buffalo wings, but an order is $10. Curds are also good. If you like your beer in a cold frosty mug, this is a good place for you."}
{"text":"Monk's has been reviewed to death, so I'm not going to add anything of worth.  They're a little pricey for my simple tastes, but they don't skimp on the servings.  One sandwich is two meals.   The service was good.  The new building in Sun Prairie is deceptively large.  They know what they're doing.  I'd go back anytime."}
{"text":"Monks is awesome! I have loved all the food that I've tried from them but their chicken tenders, honey mustard and tater tots always hits the spot for me. I recommend not coming on game days if you want to try to avoid a wait or eat at a less busy time. They are good for bigger groups and we've always had excellent service. They recently did an expansion and their outdoor seating is now much bigger. I always recommend this place to others and it's a great option to have dinner at before catching a movie at the theater down the road!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Nice size. Quick service at table in busy bar area. Also quick serving of suggested BBQ chicken mac n cheese. Good comfort food as advertised; not outstanding. Wish they had more exotic taps. Lots of TV to catch golf, baseball and college sports."}
{"text":"Came here before our movie for a couple burgers and drinks. The food and service was simply perfect. I have nothing to criticize about monk's. Had an awesome experience."}
{"text":"You know you're in Wisconsin when... Your \"burrito\" is actually a cold chicken breast wrap... With tater tots as a side.

2 star ingredients; good thing we have fresh picked strawberries waiting for us at grandma's house. Way to redeem yourself, WI!

5 star service from Halie. She helped us stay strong in our dairy free endeavors."}
{"text":"There are things about this Monk's that I really like, and then there some things that could use improvement. 

The food, for me, has been consistently prepared well, flavorful, and to my liking. They have a nice menu selection that just about anyone should be able to find something to eat on, even vegetarian options. The Chili Cauliflower Bites, The Big 10 burger, and the Carnivore Tots are my favorites. 

Last time I was in, I was there with 4 other ladies and myself. What bothered me was our server. Monk's has a huge list of fun and fruity drinks which we all ordered from - except one of us. She specifically asked the server what he would recommend that was going to be sweet but not as high in sugar and calories as some of the more decadent drinks. 

His words, \"I don't know, I'm terrible at my job, hahah.\" 

I think it was a supposed to be a joke, but he really should have offered to talk to the bartender to see what could be made for someone who is requesting a lower cal option. He did follow up with, \"Vodka soda, that has zero calories!\" Which - is incorrect, and also not sweet. 

I get it if a server doesn't know all the options available from the bar, but it was his job to go speak to the bartender and come up with an option."}
{"text":"It was opening on a Saturday, so the restaurant was pretty quiet.  We were seated immediately and our server was there to get drinks right away too.  Somehow we only got one out of two children's menus, but it wasn't an issue because only one of my kids colors on them.  

Prices are reasonable in the $10 range and they have good choices of burgers, sandwiches, salads and wraps.  The kids menu is typical chicken nuggets/cheeseburger/mac and cheese but there are a few good options for sides.  Fries or oranges/salad and I forgot what else.  The meals come on a frisbee you get to take home, but I believe I forgot them because it's hard to remember to bring home your plate even with a menu reminder!  

I do wish there were more gluten-free options, but it is a sports bar.  Their gator tots are fantastically crunchy, so if you like tots I definitely recommend those.  Decor is all sports and monkey memorabilia.  It is Monks!  And there are TVs everywhere with sports on."}
{"text":"I didn't think the food was something special, but it tasted good and if someone wanted to go there for a meal I would gladly come back. The service was very good, and extremely friendly and responsive even on what seemed to be a pretty busy night. The atmosphere is what I would expect in a sports bar, but also was well suited for families and groups."}
