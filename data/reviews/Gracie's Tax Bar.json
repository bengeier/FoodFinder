{"text":"Hard to find with no sign on building except for an old tenants name.   Drinks aren't that cheap and it was noisy and had no table service.   Definitely a place for a young crowd  that only wants a choice of four snacks to eat."}
{"text":"Awesome new bar downtown! Just what the area needed, an awesome neighborhood spot with cheap drinks and great bar food."}
{"text":"I yelped \"dive\" bars on yelp. Gracie's came up. Soooo happy I stopped by here to do some business on my phone. This is definitely a classy, cute dive bar - with great customer service & good music. They even offer a few sandwiches, including vegetarian options. Great find, & good beer options. Nice, clean, & spacious. I live in Tempe, but I will return to this spot! I wish there were places like this in Tempe! My photos don't do this place justice."}
{"text":"It's 9:30 pm on a Friday night in 1974. The local DMV waiting lobby has closed for the weekend but a bearded posse of bartenders and their entourage have broken down the back door and set up shop as if they've owned the place since Nixon was elected. That's Gracie's. The red neon glow, government issue high top tables, 12x12 linoleum tile, and enameled cinder block walls give this bar an authentic ambiance most \"hipster\" dives artificially strive for. You won't regret stopping in."}
{"text":"Was excited to check out something new and hoping Gracie's lived up to the hype. Super inexperienced lady bartender last night couldn't make a drink (dirty vodka, come on). The bar-back was on his 2nd shift ever and was the most helpful guy in the joint. No reason to go back, sadly."}
{"text":"Cool little place for an ice cold beer after work. In a very up and coming neighborhood. I drop by from time to time to catch up with friends. Great beer selection."}
{"text":"Average bar, good service. Fun juke box. Don't forget your skinny jeans and cigarettes"}
{"text":"Nice to have a new dive bar in the neighborhood. It reminds me of Casey Moore's in atmosphere but the setting is different. A good mix of interesting people. My friend and I spent $35ish for 4 well drinks and a beer, not bad. They also have a patio which seems cool and I'll definitely check it out once it's not 100Â° at night."}
{"text":"Love this bar! If you have a chance order the fried pickle spears! Never left here unhappy. It's like stepping back in time with their vintage interior and the back patio is a nice place to have a conversation with a date or friends!"}
{"text":"Always good service but also what really makes this establishment 5 stars is the subtle It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia quote on the bottom of their receipts"}
{"text":"When you enter Gracie's, you almost expect Sam Malone and Woody to be tending bar. The wood-paneling and long, high-top bar makes everything feel right with the world. We needed (and still need, unfortunately) a great neighborhood watering hole Downtown. 

Last night I visited Gracie's around 8:30pm. I sat down at the bar and was greeted pretty quickly. No problems. I ask for my standard of Buffalo Trace on the rocks. The bartender grabs the bottle, pulls out a jigger, and begins to pour. 

I have to say, I hate when bars measure shots. I totally understand that Gracie's isn't running a charity, but it just hurts the entire experience when things feel so formulaic. When the human element is taken away from the drink pour, I become immediately aware that I'm not at a place where \"everybody knows my name.\" I'm at a place that just wants my money. Of course I already know this, but a good bar makes you forget that. I mean, can't you just train your people how to pour a proper shot? I expect this from an Applebee's or any other chain bar but not from a place like Gracie's that's obviously going for a certain vibe. Nothing up to this point was too egregious, though. Annoying? Yes. Unforgivable? No.

Things just went downhill from there. I'm not normally someone who watches the bartender pour my drink, but I just happened to notice that he didn't even fill the alcohol to the line. For goodness sakes, if you are going to measure the liquor, at least give me a full shot. I gave him the benefit of the doubt, though. Mistakes happen. I drank it quickly - both because there was so little of it and because it tasted extra delicious for some reason. I immediately decided I needed a second round, so I waited and waited and waited. The workers (they surely aren't bartenders) just goofed around with each other while I sat there thinking about my next taste of the Buffalo. I thought about just leaving, and I should have in hindsight, but I finally just asked for the refill after 10 minutes.

This time around I made sure to pay attention to see if I was getting what I paid for. Nope! I was noticeably shorted again. At this point it was obvious that they didn't care that I was there. They were just waiting to finish their shifts, but they could have at least had the courtesy to give me a proper pour. 

I was pretty annoyed and asked for my check, so I could leave and cut my losses. $22 for two \"shots\" of BT. What?!?! $9 per \"shot\" and $1 for ice. I've never heard of a bar charging $1 for ice. Maybe that's what hip bars are doing these days, but it's one of the dumbest things I've ever heard of. Unbelievable. I will not be back - not that they care."}
{"text":"Cool new spot. Drinks were affordable, service was great, and the bar was busy but had plenty of seating. Large patio which is a must and outside windows to order drinks. I would definitely recommend stopping in, this is a cool new spot for any occasion."}
{"text":"Were it not for a kind gesture from the bartender (more on that in a minute), Gracie's wouldn't likely get an endorsement from me.  That's not to say there's nothing endearing about Gracie's, as there is plenty about this place that Downtown residents and barflies will love.  A friend of mine raves about this place, which is what brought me in on a Sunday evening for a gander.

You'll find Gracie's in an old brick building on the east side of 7th Avenue just south of McKinley Street.  The building once housed an old tax service company that has long since gone defunct.  That was until Grace Perry (former lead singer of a local band and an alum of local restaurant company Upward Projects) took over the bones of this building and made it a bar (with a back patio for good measure).  

As of the day I visited, the place is seven months old and has already gained a steady following.  I arrived shortly after opening and the main bar inside was already near full.  If you're coming during the daytime, allow your eyes a few minutes to adjust to this dimly lit quasi divvy lounge.  Supposedly this place is packed after 9pm nightly so bear that in mind too.  Tons of board games don a bookshelf next to a single arcade game on one side of the room while an old school jukebox adorns the other side.  The interior seats probably 40, but with plenty of room for standing patrons to double that.  No room for standing patrons outside, but plenty of seating for a couple dozen.  The furniture, such as it is, looks like something you'd find at yard sales and recycled bar supply outlets.  

Both the drink and food menus here are, well, simple.  In fact they don't even bother giving you a menu.  No fancy mixed drinks, no fancy bar food, no bullshit basically.  I told the bartender it was my first time in and asked him if there was any drink he'd recommend.  They have about a half dozen beers on tap as well as canned items and a pretty full assortment of hard liquors.  But despite all those options, the bartender recommended their Miller High Life on tap.  I laughed and basically said sure what the hell.  Surprisingly he said it was on the house since I was a first timer.  Sweet!  I mean sure High Life isn't pricey, but thanks man.  As for the food, you have to look behind the counter to find the cardboard menu and it ain't lengthy.  I counted three bar snack items to choose from and just one main entree.  So I got their one entree called a Chopped Cheese (basically a cross between a Philly cheesesteak and a burger) and an order of their tater tots.

The Chopped Cheese includes beef, peppers, onions, lettuce, spicy mayo, and cheese sauce on a hoagie roll.  They cook it right behind the bar and pile the toppings high to where you'll likely need to dig in with a fork (which they do provide).  Eating this while stone cold sober, it was just okay.  Though this would be pretty ideal if I were drunk or hung over.  The tater tots were, well, tater tots.  A decent bar snack anytime though again probably geared more towards the heavy drinking and late night crowds.

Total cost for the food, tax, and tip came to $13.  So let's just put the food aspect aside for a moment as its pretty irrelevant to Gracie's business model anyway.  As a neighborhood watering hole, Gracie's is a comfortable, no frills, judgment free zone.  If you want cheap beer or a couple shots of your favorite liquor, you're in luck.  And if you're looking for a cozy late night bar hangout spot with your friends near the Roosevelt District, Gracie's fits the billing.  You want a good drink variety, a formal menu or unique food & libations?  Forget about it.  I could see artists, barflies, and local Downtown college students falling hard for Gracie's.  For everyone else, your results will vary."}
{"text":"Came here with the intention of having a great time tonight with my girls and got turned down! I mean I was only trying to flirt with the man at the doorway, I wasn't even trying to be rude. Played a small joke on him and he got so offended he denied me and my girls to come in. My bike crew comes here all the time! We love this place. Just wasn't expecting that kind of courtesy. Not after how much I've raved about this place. I'm a sad panda. That's all for now."}
{"text":"Exactly the place Phoenix needed! A friendly vibe, great staff and straightforward menu. Did I mention the best fried pickles I have ever had? Most definitely a spot you could come with friends, coworkers, or celebratory drinks anytime of the day! A must stop spot."}
{"text":"I've only been once but love the vibe so far. I have heard from my comrades that on weekends, this place is \"so hip it hurts\" but going in at 5pm on a weekday, it's just a dimly lit, uncrowded dive bar with $5 drafts and cheap wells. They had 2 good IPAs on draft and Dales pale ale as well. They also have a limited fried food snack bites you can get, which they make right behind the bar. Fried pickles, onion rings, tater tots/ that sorta bar grub (for under $5) ...  I like this place, and what I like even more- it's a walking distance from my house  the juke box blasts out good jams and They have a smoking-friendly section out back. Worth checking out. I'm glad there is another bar I can hop to before/after going to the Vig!"}
{"text":"Fun place, packed on First Friday. It's a fairly simple setup- main building with a long bar, patio out back, bathrooms off the patio. The main bar feeds the patio via an opening. This is an austere kind of place the serves up good booze (not sure of the prices, I wasn't paying) in nice clean non pretentious atmosphere. I like it! Nice addition to our neighborhood"}
{"text":"Probably the best place I've been in a while.  What You see Is what you get drinks are amazing and the food???? Chopped Cheese, tater tots and onion rings!  GTFOH!  I love this place."}
{"text":"Such a great new addition to the downtown Phoenix neighborhood!  We stopped in on a hot Saturday afternoon and it was the perfect escape from the heat - dark, cool and pouring a tasty $5 cider...and did I mention a jukebox packed with diverse and amazing music?!?  Love the unpretentious atmosphere...we'll definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere of the bar and the patio and staff are super nice. 

The tater tots are superb. The clientele tends to smoke and wear Cabbage Patch Kids/man bun hairdos a lot but other than that I like it. Just try to ignore the hip couple making out in the corner behind you. And don't order the chopped cheese, it's just not what you think. 

Tl;dr: we would definitely come back. With friends. (We took turns editing this yelp review, we had so much fun, a testament to the fact that this place is dope :) - highly recommend)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's super hip without trying to be. They have good, cheap drinks. Wine comes out of a box. Cocktails are inexpensive and hand crafted. NO frills at all. The food menu is very limited but tots and fried pickles are both quite good. I LOVE that it doesn't even look like a bar from the outside. The patio is cute as well. The people who work there are friendly and make you just want to hang out and play a board game or two."}
{"text":"Local spot that's hidden!! You probably drive right by it if you didn't see the people walking in and out!!  Great STAFF!! Great atmosphere!! Super cool place with zero drama!   FRIED PICKLES!! Tater tots!! And the chopped cheese are all great choices!! Kitchen stays open until close so always a chance to snack on bar food!! Don't tell too many people so we can keep it as cool and low key as it is!!"}
{"text":"Cheap alcohol, great laid-back atmosphere. What more do you want? The back patio is also a great place to relax when weather permits."}
{"text":"Fun, new place. Simple food menu. Cheap drinks. I dig it. Arcade games, jukebox. Super friendly staff. And there's a patio- next time I'll bring the pup."}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly, drinks always seem to taste better here, and I usually run into a friend or two. I recommend the tots or fried pickles if you need a snack to share with a friend."}
{"text":"Gracie's is not a bar that's about the spectacle of going out. If you want live music or a dance floor, there are better options incredibly close. This may be a harsh way to start off, but I really do like this place. It has a specific purpose in my downtown Phoenix bar rotation. It's just the best way to start this out.

Now, what exactly is Gracie's? It's a smaller bar located in an old tax building, hence the name Tax Bar. The inside has this really nice neon red lighting, and the usual assortment of tables and bar games that would expect to find at a place like this. One highlight in my mind is the playlists they usually have going. I dig the heavy rotation of classic alt songs, and it really sets the mood. Drink prices are reasonable, and they have a limited food menu. Great if you like fried things as bar food.

My biggest issue with this place is the patio. There really isn't enough seating on busy nights. One thought I have is that the tables they have in the middle are too big for the space, since they all kind of bleed into each other in the center of the patio. I like the standing area with places to put your drinks on the periphery. Maybe if they swapped out some of the larger tables for picnic benches it would be more manageable. Otherwise, the outdoor bar window is a convenient way to get drinks when you need them. I'll also note that they seem to have only once bathroom each for women and men. So you may be waiting a while if you break the seal.

If you want a place with cool atmosphere to hang out with maybe 1-2 other people, I recommend this place. If you're rolling any larger than that, you may have a difficult time."}
{"text":"This place verry good. Has very good bar, extreme good drink. Total good bartender , all of them .patio total thumb up. Not know how not total 5 star, because I feel total 5 star about Gracie tax !!!!!!1 every juke song good!!! Every person very good! Only thing all not good 5 star is chair, some chair butt gets stuck in, but funny! Bathroom graffiti really good - listen to Alanis Morissette !!!!! Ever heard your favorite Growler song in juke cube?? Ever seen beautiful candle on every table and skeleton man who is regular???? I have at Gracie tax!!! Look never further"}
{"text":"Such a great neighborhood bar. I love coming here for a beer, even if it's so solo. I always find someone friendly to talk to, and they're always showing some random movie from the 80s, which I love. The place nails the Dive Bar aesthetic without trying too hard, if that makes any sense. Having lived in the Midwest for a decade, Gracie's feels very much at home. This is one of my new go-to places to bring out-of-towners or people who aren't familiar with the downtown area."}
{"text":"This is kind of a modern version of an old dive bar.  I like the ambiance with low ceilings over the bar and dim lighting.  The servers were very nice.  They had a small TV on my side of the bar and it was great to be able to watch the Dbacks game without disturbing the other patrons or turning the place into a sports bar.  I had an Oak Creek IPA which was just OK.  I get that they are trying to be local with their beer but how about considering a higher-rated Wren House, Pueblo Vida or Mother Road IPA as a possible selection?"}
{"text":"Met an out-of-town friend here last night for drinks. I ordered a Kentucky Mule and we had some tater tots-both were delicious. It was a great atmosphere inside and out. We moved to the patio when a table cleared, and enjoyed sitting, eating, talking, and warming up by their space heaters. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The drinks are good and cheap, the decor is cool and relaxed, and the vibe is super comfortable. Gracie's is a totally worthy spot to add to any downtown bar crawl!"}
{"text":"This is the spot. If you want a chill vibe go when the sun is still up cuz as soon as it sets the bustle starts. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Servers were attentive, drinks spot on, and the atmosphere very inviting and friendly. The two items we ordered, fried pickles and tots, were perfect bar food and were delicious. A definite must before any concert at Van Buren or anytime you want some bomb fried pickles!"}
{"text":"Great vibe, Scottsdale prices. The wood paneling made me feel at home, the drink prices made me not want to come back. $7 for a Smirnoff and soda. $14 for a double. And they are measured pours. For something in the ghetto (Avenues), they are full of themselves."}
{"text":"A good bar needs very little description. Good drinks! Good prices! Attracts a fun crowd! Nice outside patio!  All in all, a very good bar!"}
{"text":"Super cute!!!! It has an old school diner feel to it with a bar atmosphere. The patio is a bit on the cozy side, therefore you will get some second smoke! Hipster feel to it, would go again and would recommend to a friend!"}
{"text":"Cheap greasy food, great location, plenty of parking, super friendly staff and owner - this place is a hit already. Oh did I mention they had the excellent film \"Blank Check\" on the TV!? Their jukebox is great, they've got board games and the owner, Grace, says she wants to encourage D&D playing there. This place is rad and a welcome addition to downtown."}
{"text":"Came here after checking out a few bars in DTPHX. I enjoyed my VodkaTonic with extra lemon while playing some cool games they had on shelf. Time flew right by! Good vibes, good drinks and fun games! Def a spot to hangout with friends."}
{"text":"Fun little dive bar with friendly service and a great vibe.  They did a great job of making it a dive bar. Thought it was original decor"}
{"text":"Cool new bar. This would be my go-to spot if it were closer to 5th Street.

Hipster friendly.

Cool AF patio (not dog friendly *total bummer*)."}
{"text":"Fun, busy place. Cheap drinks, nice atmosphere, attentive bartenders. Didn't try the food but definitely will next time. Great to know there's a fun, chill place near downtown PHX."}
{"text":"We went on the Sunday, only two days after they'd opened their doors. The bar was packed at 8pm, with only one table available, which we promptly snagged. 

The decor (like the wood-paneled walls) makes you feel like you're in a dive bar, but at second glance, you can tell they put plenty of thought and effort into that comfortable ambiance. The dark red lighting is deep and cozy, and the music plays loudly from beautiful, classic stereos that remind me of the wood covered ones that my dad used to blare The Who from. On one wall were a pile of board games. On another stood a jukebox that, on a less busy night, I'd love to spend some time flipping through. Meanwhile, behind the bar, Young Frankenstein was playing. Hell. Yes. 

Drinks weren't badly priced at all for a downtown Phoenix bar. I would probably recommend sticking to simple mixed drinks, beer, or wine. 

Chill vibes, rad people, and good drinks. You down? I know I am."}
{"text":"Came to do some work during a really chill hour it was myself and two other people in the bar/patio. Friendly staff :) Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Pros: Cool building, nice patio. 

Cons: same albums play in the juke every single time, without exception. ( Curtis mayfield, hall and Oates, Black Sabbath, ramones and fleet wood mac.)

If you pay with cash you will get shortchanged every time.

PBR 5$+tax. Pay with card $5.43. Pay with cash they ask $5.50. You can reason that it's  only 7cents. Yes. But it's 7 cents in every cash paying customer every time. It is theft. And it's 7 cents on a beer that's already marked up pretty steeply.

I'd like to like this place more ?.

Would like to see them stop shortchanging customers."}
{"text":"Definitely a bar bar but with great people great prices doesn't need a happy hour. Limited good but available fried pickles onion rings"}
{"text":"Love the bar and the people one of the most unassuming and welcoming spots to grab a drink downtown"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a neighborhood bar with a relaxed vibe and cheap drinks Gracie's is the spot. Popped over for happy hour on Friday and was pleased to hear there were no happy hour specials, but the $3.75 wells make you happy all the time. The lighting is dark and the bartenders are awesome. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fun little bar! Decor = minimal, drinks = good, price = good, food = some, jukebox = great, energy and ambiance = awesome!"}
{"text":"Gracie's got da gudz. Flame-swoll is probably the most taxonomically correct way to categorize Gracie's awesomeness. 

im a sucker for red ligthing so i already loved this place right when i walked in. then the jukebox played a mix of wu-tang and late 70s-early 80s rock. got me swirling in a lagoon of vibes. vibes vibes vibes. and then just as i was shoulders-deep in that lagoon, they hit me with God Only Knows by the Beach boys. like did i even stand a chance? no, no i didnt. gracie had me right where she wanted me.

rapid-fire: the outside area is equally vibe-tastic. great prices. board games so you aren't bored lames. friendly bartenders. short menu with the essentials: fried pickles, o-ringz, something else, and taters tots. trill tots at da chill spot make ya feel hot like an eel's watts

i love you gracie. see you soon"}
{"text":"One of the most intriguing new watering holes in Central Phoenix, Gracie's is a diner and bar serving an up-and-coming clientele from Grand Avenue. It feels like a dive, but is still much too new and shiny to have that seedy, dangerous feel I know and love. 

I love the atmosphere here, with soft red lights on the inside, and a decently-sized patio on the outside. I love the drink prices, with inexpensive wells and domestic beer. I like how much effort they're putting into having something interesting going on every week, like local bands or luau themes. I even like the limited menu, which I have not yet tried but am totally down to. 

Just be warned that when Gracie's is crowded, it's a bit painful. Good luck ever sitting down inside on the weekends. As for the patio, there might be too many seats and tables. When it's full, you can't stand anywhere without feeling like you're hovering directly over someone's seat. If they want everyone sitting down, they need to watch the capacity. Otherwise standing is fine. Also, the single-occupancy restrooms can be a nightmare when it's 1am and everyone has to go. 

That won't stop me from kicking it outside and ordering from the sliding window they've got, so long as the bartenders remember it actually exists. 

I know, I know, I'm being critical, but I really do like this place. I mean, I don't like it as much as Bikini or Lost Leaf or Thirdspace, but I'm glad to have something else in the nightlife rotation to freshen stuff up."}
{"text":"Cool place.
Nice atmosphere.
Friendly people.
Cool owner.
Board games for the customers.
Trick boho vibe to the back patio.
The fried pickles are da bomb.
The Doors on the Juke, can't beat it.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"24 oz PBR's and a jukebox? Count me in. Great vibes here on a Saturday night. I liked the outdoor patio. Also some great bathroom stall poetry."}
{"text":"Love love love it. Cool dank and original. Like taking a page out of Mel's diner and throwing in some dim mood lighting and a rocking jukebox. I felt like I was somewhere in the middle of Midwest nowhere Ville.  Or in a Quentin Tarantino film.  Also the short / petite bartender was super friendly. And on a day when it was 106 degrees,  the plentiful misters and fans on the outdoor patio made it actually bearable. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"In an unassuming building with a simple neon \"Gracie's\" sign on the front of it, when you step inside you're transported to a no-b.s.-cheap drinks-luminiscently-lit dive bar.  The drinks hit the spot, especially on a weekday. There's a jukebox with rad tunes on it and shelves of games you can't help but grab. We ourselves, ended up playing old school Battleship and having a good time sinking each others' ships. The patio reminds me of sitting in someone's backyard and just kicking it. I'm genuinely surprised hipsters have not taken over this tiny, super low key bar, but maybe it was timing, I hope they won't anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ok guys..... I don't totally get it. This is essentially a dive bar that is 'cool' because it was intentionally divey? Or something? I came in with a friend on a Friday night and the place was super busy. We were able to snag a couple seats at the bar. We were informed they do not have a cocktail menu.... they're not 'that kind of bar.' So you have to order a classic drink of sorts and hope the price is reasonable. Their prices were fairly reasonable.....the drink I got (an old fashioned) was strooooooong and cost around 9$. Probably more than I would expect at your average dive bar, but less than at a fancy cocktail bar (also far less tasty though....I'm talking straight up booze in a glass). My friend got a couple of drinks and got lucky only paying around 5$ each....good deal. Unfortunately, none of the drinks were better than what you could just make at home. The patio area is nice, but so crowded you couldn't hang out out there the night we went. The food looks interesting. Though I wouldn't be opposed to coming back if someone else wanted to go, this wouldn't be a place I would suggest, but that's mostly due to the kind of drinks I personally like. If you just want a place to drink super strong drinks that has a hipster atmosphere, this may be the place for you."}
{"text":"Amazing! This place is so cool. It is all red inside and you feel like you're in a whole new place. The food is great as well! The veggie chopped cheese (veggie beef Philly cheese steak) is absolutely amazing!!! Totally loved this place!"}
{"text":"Cool new spot in Phoenix. Dim red lighting sets the mood for a hip, somewhat divey bar. Decent beer selection, incl Dale's Pale Ale, Papago Orange Blossom, and Great Divide Colette. Higher end spirits than one might expect. Heads up: don't come if you're super hungry. While the food is tasty, there are only four or five menu items, incl the \"Chopped Cheese\" (their take on a Philly cheesesteak), onion rings, tater tots, and fried pickles. Timely service, jukebox, board games, great dog- friendly patio."}
{"text":"Very cool new spot downtown. It's a little different than all the other millennial-filled establishments. Cheap well drinks, a handful of craft beers, and a menu of 4 or 5 items. We tried the Chopped Cheese and the fried pickles, both of which were great. I would describe the Chopped Cheese as a Philly cheesesteak with the sliced steak strips replaced with ground beef. The menu fits the atmosphere perfectly.
The patio also has plenty of seats and will be a great place to have some beers when the weather is cooler. They also have board games you can play while sitting at a table.
If Gracie is taking suggestions, I'd like to see the fried pickles go from pickle spears to pickle chips. But I'll probably order them again either way. Great new bar!"}
