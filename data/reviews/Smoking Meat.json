{"text":"You have to stop here: hands down, the best beef sandwich I've ever had; and I've had a lot of beef sandwiches. The beef is the softest and tastiest beef I've ever tasted; you don't even need teeth to eat the meat - it's that soft - the taste is incredible, and the after taste is just as amazing. It will leave a lasting impression on your soul; I'm not kidding. Here's why it's like nothing you've ever had: they smoke the local, organic beef, then cook it for 72 hours, using a space-age technique that will blow your mind. Buy a smoked beef sandwich from Smoking Meat, and you will never forget it."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to try Montreal smoked meat near the convention center and decided to pick up some sandwiches here for lunch. The place was empty and I see a counter with what looks to be individual packets of meat. I think surely this place isn't just selling prepackaged meat and claiming that it's any good. Sure enough when I ordered my sandwiches I see the guy behind the counter rip open one of these packets for each and put it on some bread with mustard.

...and it's incredibly delicious. I've had plenty of corned beef style sandwiches before and this was something unique. The meat is incredibly smoky and spiced really well. But the most important thing is how tender it is. The beef just absolutely melts in your mouth in a way New York pastrami doesn't. It was wonderful.

I can't comment on the service or anything else on the menu but these sandwiches were great and highly recommended."}
{"text":"With all my visits to Montreal and what people have been raving about it as the top 3 to get in mtl (poutine, maple syrup, and smoked meat) so I defiantly had to see what the hype was all about. I came here and ordered a smoked meat sandwich and a beer and ahh man let me tell you, coming from NYC with our roost beef and ruebens, this by far was awesome. The meat was tender and soft as if they cared and loved for it before shipping it to the store. Honestly, when looking at it, it looks like a regular sandwich but that 1st bite full of flavor makes you want to buy another one before even finishing the entire sandwich. *fyi I had smoked meat poutine at another place the following night and the meat did not compare with the sandwich"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great place! All 3 meat options are amazing, the beef is my favorite though, pork would be second then the turkey. Friendly staff and nice patio seating with a view of the water (kind of). I'll be back for sure... if you're looking for a good smoked meat sandwich in old town, this is the place!"}
{"text":"During my trip to Montreal, we ate at 3 smoked meat restaurants. Smoking Meat was the best tasting sandwich by far. Great atmosphere, great staff, delicious smoked meat. Can't ask for more!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite meal in Montreal
Moist juicy pork stuffed between two thin slices of bread.  It doesn't come with any dressing but I asked for some mustard and it went perfectly with the sandwich
Included for around $13 you get a bottle of water and a side of cole slaw
It doesn't look like a lot of food but they include a lot of meat so it's very filling
A few spots to sit outside and you can sit inside as well
Highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here because it was pouring rain out and didn't have tons of options. We wanted poutine and they offer it with smoked meat on top. Their poutine isn't made with fries, rather, full potatoes. Not a poutine expert, but I didn't love it. Flavor was missing something and there was too much gravy. 

They do have a great Kobe beef selection."}
{"text":"Julian, one of the owners, was so sweet and knowledgable. He made the best sangria that ive ever had.
My husband and I shared a pork plate and it was the juiciest and most flavorful meat ever. The seasoning is unusual and it left me wanting more. We travel alot and since hubby is paleo, we're always eating smoked meats but this was the bomb!!
Please go and support this young business!!"}
{"text":"This place was great.  We were in town from Toronto for the weekend and one of my friends insisted that we stop by here on our way back home.  It was about noon on a Sunday and I was surprised that the place was empty. I would have thought a place like that would be packed in that part of town on a weekend. Between my group of friends, I think we tried it all: beef, pork and turkey, and they were all delicious.  I tried the turkey after eating half my own pork sandwich so the taste was a lot more subtle and I felt like I could only taste the mustard but my friend that only had the turkey loved it. The sandwiches are authentic, just comes on rye with the meat and mustard and it's served with a bottle of water and coleslaw. Comes to $16. And if you really love it, You can even take some meat home with you!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised I'm the first person to review this place.  Located just off the main entrance to the  Old Port of Montreal, it's easy to miss this establishment.  I've heard that smoked meat is a Montreal specialty and this place gave me my first taste.  Not disappointed.

The menu gives you 3 choices of smoked meat (beef, pork and kobe beef).  Each sandwich comes with cole slaw (made here with mustard as a base, not mayo) and is carved to order.  There is also poutine and artisanal soda if you're interested.  

The smoked beef was excellent and tastes a lot like pastrami for those looking for a comparison.  The best bite though was the smoked pork which was akin to having a mildly sweet honey ham but without all the salt.  Each bite was great.  The poutine was also slightly different here as they used whole roasted new potatoes instead of fries.  As can be expected in a tourist area, the prices are probably higher than if you had something similar in other parts of Montreal ($14 bucks Canadian per sandwich) but its reasonable for the area and honestly tasted better than anything I've eaten in the general vicinity.  Thumbs up."}
{"text":"We stopped in to have sandwiches and a couple beers in Old Montr√©al. We tried the beef and pork; they were both excellent. We also ordered the potato wedges - these were mediocre. A couple of bottles of water were included at no cost. 

Overall it seemed a bit overpriced, but as tourists in Montreal it was worth the experience for a convenient and tasty lunch."}
{"text":"If your looking for a good meal keep walking. This is not smoked meat that Montreal is known for.  Yelp fail on this."}
