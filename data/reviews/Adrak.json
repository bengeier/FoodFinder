{"text":"Nice and modern fine Indian cuisine. The service is slow...it took them 45 mins to bring out our appetizers and another 30 mins for our entr√©e. But once the food was out omg it was legit Indian food. Biryani was mind blowing. Many staff but slow service. It has open side of kitchen where one chef is making naan and cook kabobs"}
{"text":"This restaurant is in an odd location, as it's in the storefront of an office building, but it's right off HWY 7 so it's visible from the busy road.  Upon entering, it's a contemporary decor. The best part that was you can see the kitchen from wherever you sit. It made everything seem extremely authentic.

The food, was definitely a 5 out of 5. The prices were reasonable, only a few more dollars than other locations in the GTA. But the quantity and quality were much better, so the price was definitely worth it in my opinion. I ordered the chicken tikka masala, garlic naan and shared some basmati rice with my friends. My chicken was $15, and came with at least 10 1\" cubed chunks of chicken. It also came with lots of onion and bell peppers. The naan was exquisite. It was fluffy, slightly chewy like it should be and melt in your mouth! And I suggest sharing the rice! One order was plenty for 4 people.

Now the service is where this restaurant lots points. The server made a big deal about us not having a reservation on a Thursday night, even though half the restaurant was unoccupied. He also made comments that came off as a joke, but were also unnecessary and seemed like complaints at times. For example, we asked at the beginning for this to be separate, in which case he made us order all together in a certain way. When we asked for separate bills at the end, he made it sound like a huge ordeal, when we witnessed splitting the cheque only took 2 mins max. Just things where he tried to joke but it seemed he complained about everything we asked for.  He was however attentive and we didn't have to track him down."}
{"text":"THE best Indian food I've tasted in GTA. Unique dishes from around India, served beautifully and infused with scrumptious flavours."}
{"text":"The food has a good balance of indian spices .. not overly indian and not too white washed.

Good portion for the price."}
{"text":"For an Indian restaurant trying to be upscale is always a challenge.  The taste has to be a little more fusion and mainstream to appeal to non- Indians.

That said these guys don't do a bad job.

Kashmiri lamb chops were great.  Curry dishes are not traditional flavored but overall nice.  The portion sizes are good.  Veggie dishes not bad.  

Skip the chicken pakoras .. average breading.

Service was great.  Food served promptly.

A little over priced but will go again."}
{"text":"This place just opened a few months ago. I was very impressed with the food, service and decor. We will definitely be coming back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"We went here for a lunch for the first time. The restaurant is clean a beautifully renovated. My group got almost everyone the daily chicken prefix menu. The service was really really slow! Be prepared for that. i can understand that it might be cultural thing but the table next to us came later and ate first... It was a regular week day - maybe it's not the best to let working people wait for an hour for their food.
On the plus side this was the best naan I have ever had :-) The food was overall good. Nice experience, but in the end when the bill came I thought it was overpriced...
I would only come for a second time only for the naan which I don't think will happen..."}
{"text":"Nice interior design but a bit cheapo material and finish.service is good but lack of food Explanation. The food are maybe too Indian authentic,so chicken comes over cook and too much seasoning which I don't like them,soup also taste funny."}
{"text":"Give yourself a treat and eat here!
My husband and I went with two other couples and were treated to an amazing and unexpected evening. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, staff was extremely friendly and attentive to our every need. I highly recommend you take the mixologist up on some of his creative drinks. If not just for the delicious drinks but for the show alone.
The open glass kitchen also provides some entertainment watching the breads and meats being prepared.
Not being overly familiar with Indian Cuisine the menu was easy to navigate with plenty of options to try both new and traditional items. We of course over ordered...or so we thought.....but soon realized there was hardly anything left at the end of our feast! It was that good! I would like to recommend a certain dish but out of the twelve we ordered ....appetizer and main..... I couldn't pick which was better. So all I can recommend is give your palate a treat and try it all! 
We are already planning our next visit."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Adrak a few times with my family who frequent this spot a lot. In all honesty I have loved the food, but in the past the service wasn't what I would expect it to be for a fine dining Indian restaurant. That all changed tonight. Terry, the general manager, along with our waiter made not only my experience unforgettable, but exceeded all expectations I would expect from a restaurant. As soon as we walked in, I briefly mentioned I had a flight to catch and it was important that our dining experience not exceed 1.5 hours. Not only did they deliver all of our dishes piping hot,but they timed out appetizers so we did not receive everything all at once. The GM also made a great wine selection based on his knowledge of wines, not only price point.  I am stuffed to the brim right now, but looking forward to the next time we come to Adrak. Loved their aloo papri chaat, their new dal (absolutely the best!) and their madras murgh. All the dishes were so tasty, served with jeera rice and garlic naan. Highly recommend all of these dishes. But beware, they are spicy, but extremely delicious. Terry and staff thanks again for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance, delicious food and everyone who works there is so friendly and personable! We really enjoyed our Saturday night dinner.
Great place to take your kids! We love the open kitchen concept, where you can see the chefs making the most delicious \"naans, roomali rotis\" and other kinds of breads.
Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a classy Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Was here last week! Very disappointed! Food was not good, service was terrible. Only thing edible might be their naan, and butter chicken. I do not recommend coming here. Apparently they changed their entire staff, food once taste good I heard. If u wanna risk it, go try it:/"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing ambiance, amazing service, amazing layout and decor. One of the finest Indian cuisines with first-class quality in food and appearance. We ordered the Bharwan Aloo Potohari as an appetizer which was absolutely delicious. Definitely recommended for anyone. For the main course we ordered the Shahi Kadhi Paneer and Malai Kofta with Tandoori and Roomali Roti. The curries were finger-licking worthy and you could taste the freshness in the ingredients. Nothing like the generic Punjabi food in other restaurants. The Roomali Roti was very soft but too buttery for my taste and I could do without it next time. The serving sizes were moderate, good enough for my family of three. There were 4 Rotis / basket. Price was slightly expensive however you don't feel the guilt once you taste the food. Overall, an amazing place with a very classy feel and outstanding food. Nice to see such original Indian food here."}
{"text":"Ambiance is very nice. Service is a little slow. We ordered missi roti which was very dry. The food is not very hot, all of our dishes were warm to cold. The stuffed onions (pic attached) The naan sizes are very cute, you get two per order but enough to be filling. I don't think it's value for money at all."}
{"text":"Loved this place.
Food was amazing and service was great as well (served by David). I've been to a lot of Indian restaurants in Toronto and this is definitely my new favourite.  It is on the higher price range but you are most certainly paying for quality.  
Definitely try the biryani and the kebabs!
Will be going back for my birthday in a few short weeks!"}
{"text":"We came here in great expectations from friends but maybe it's because we arrived at 8pm, we felt we were being rushed to finish. The entrees plates were brought out admist us eating appetizers which was quite rude and the naan breads were half baked and kulchas over burnt . Although the staff had the chef pack some extra bread for leftovers it really did spoil the potential for this to have been a great family dinner experience. Also despite being a choice it would be nice to have papardums given complimentary like most high scale restaurants, which was not the case here. I hope the manager regards this feedback highly as we did not receive an apology from anyone but our waiter the day this occurred. Likely won't come back until the manager acknowledges this review and strives to correct these events from happening to other guests as well. Till then, not recommending to family and friends."}
{"text":"Came here to eat from visiting from Los Angeles
Great dishes 
Tried curry butter chicken and samosas 
Nice place , looks fancy and well kept and clean 
Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"As soon as we went in, the decor is great, the place and the color tones are very soothing yet vibrant. The service was great/speedy, and the server was ready to take your order as soon as you settled. Everything from the water serving jug to disposable expanding towels to clean hands at the end, everything was there to look aesthetically pleasing.

The drinks made by the bartender were also really well mixed, and were impressive for an Indian restaurant. We were really pleased with the place til the food came out.

The appetizers were good tasting, had a good mix of spice in it, however, the mushrooms seemed not well 'grilled' and were a bit blend. The curries were also very mediocre, and weren't worth the overpriced hype of the place.

If you are looking for a good experience, a well made cocktail, but are okay with average tasting food, this will hit the spot."}
{"text":"If I hadn't known the location, I would've guessed that Adrak was somewhere in the heart of downtown Toronto.  The dim lighting, the extensive wine lists, the glass-enclosed front kitchen, and the dark furniture and accents would be perfect for the suits-and-blazers crowd.  Surprisingly,  it's actually spot on Highway 7 just past Leslie.  

I recommend that you check out Google Maps before trying to get here though: while you can physically see the restaurant right on Highway 7, you can't actually reach the place without turning into a side street. 

Now, the important stuff: the food.  So good.  One of the standouts for me was the lamb biryani (dum-biryani).  A clay bowl contains bites of lamb mixed in rice with chopped mint, covered with a sheet of dough on top, then baked in an oven.  Yogurt (raita) is served on the side as an accompaniment to the lamb.  It's not overly \"lamby\" or gamey, and even my mom (who hates lamb) found it edible. 

Vegetables in the paneer and the okra with onions were fresh.  Beyond the plain naan, there are also options of naan layered (kulchas) with fillings (like cheese or onions) or folded (pranthas) in between (like meats). 

Super friendly service, very comfortable and ample seating (ask for the enclave or separated booth/room for a bit of extra privacy and quieter chats).  The prices are a bit higher than most Indian food restaurants by roughly $3 per dish, but I think it's worth the extra dollars for the quality and care put into the food and the surroundings. 

I look forward to coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"OK,  this place is a bit pricey. But I did get a good order in. I'm guessing the review rating at 3 maybe a bit low. I had the paneer Tikka Masala and the lamb Naan.  The curry was very flavourful, rich for sure, but that's how it's supposed to be. The Naan especially was good, the filling was a well cooked and delicate meat. UnLike many other places fail to have the right proportion on the meat to dough ratio, the chef got it bang on! Even the edges had the stuffing and that was great to note. 

The paneer was soft, veggies crunchy and a great roasted taste of the tandoor. Would definitely consider coming here again. But the decor is nothing Indian,  the glass kitchen is great but still not focal to the decor for the tables closer to the bar area. Overall, I'd day the food wins it for me"}
{"text":"Great place added for Indian cuisine. Food is very good and ambience too.
Reason for 3 stars is that the staff was very slow. We ordered appetizer - Sheek kabab and we waited for approx. 30 mins. Food came after 45 min. My friend ordered rumali roti and it came after 40 min. Are you guys serious? 
40 min for roti!!
Also closing time was 11.00 pm. One staff member came at 9.50 and asked for last order saying the cooks wants to leave so can you give the last order.
How can we know what we want to eat after 30 min.
Food - 5 stars
Time waiting - 0 stars"}
{"text":"Food is very tasty but is a great option for Indian food if you are in the area. The servers are very friendly and helpful. 

We ordered the Tandoori Whole Fish - Sea Bream, it was $22 but so tasty. The meat was so moist and absolutely delicious and flavourful. 

Definitely would come again. For the fish, the rest of the fare I find is pretty standard or slightly above standard."}
{"text":"Mr. H and I were here our anniversary with a few friends and will not be back.

The service was not good, we sat down and were immediately asked what we wanted to drink. We told him that while our friends were here sooner, we just got there and would like to look at the menu. He went away and came back again in 5 mins, it was pretty obvious that were were all catching up and would take longer than that, we told him we would call him when we were ready (there was only one other table occupied at that time). He came too often or he didn't come at all. We didn't have a major problem with him not showing up if he at least was around for us to call him and all other waiters kept avoiding eye contact. Another thing that bothered me was that, I always ask waiters to recommend a dish and when I asked our waiter what would he recommend amongst the 'Paneer' dishes, he was clueless.

The food was very average, the butter chicken was too sweet and the paneer tikka masala was ok. None of it made me want to come back, at the end of the meal Mr. H and I asked for Masala Chai which took forever to come and when it did, it was cold (they clearly forgot). The tea too was average.

Overall, not worth the money. There are better places, that cost lesser too."}
{"text":"We took our dad here for his birthday dinner and the entire family absolutely loved it.  There's more than just curry and Briyani at adrak....we ordered tandoori chicken, butter chicken and whole roasted fish.  They were all amazing.  The butter chicken must've been amongst the best I've ever had (being Indian hakka I've had my fair share of Indian food).  My mother loved the tandoori chicken as it was flavourful and juicy.  The naan was cripsy and fluffy.  Service was excellent and the place just exceeded our expectations all around."}
{"text":"Excellent food but seriously understaffed on a busy Saturday evening.  This place is
very popular for good reason.. the food is fantastic. With more staff and therefore, better service, the evening would have been so much better."}
{"text":"Dissappointed with their food today.
Lunch time visit for us and three of our friends ( who are from Miss and Bram) and finally made their cross city trip after our insistence.
The lunch items we ordered were vegetarian ( we are vegetarian) and also since the resto prides on its extensive vegetarian fare. Items were not the quality touch which we expected of this place on our earlier evening visits. Perhaps their evening chef was off duty.not impressed. The resto wasnt opened in time because apparantly the chef crew was having a late night the day earlier and we were turned back by their manager ( who did apologize profusely though) anyways ,after waiting an hour outside at a nearby timmy's , we went back in.i just hope they carry their quality across otherwise, this place may dissappear like countless others..and that  will be sad cause ,they do have something good going ."}
{"text":"came here for a Sunday brunch; and we had a group of 15 people more or less.

the service was good, and the food was delicious. 

we ordered many plates to share and they were quick and fast to accommodate our needs. sorry for the lack of pictures; there was too much going on to take shots! 

my only concern with this place was the BO from the serves - it took away from my experience when the servers would reach over me and fill glasses or pass plates."}
{"text":"We ordered 4 dishes. Lamb biryani was tasty, good flavor but small portion for $16. Daal has little taste and less salt. Chicken tikka was very average. Baingan bharta was over spiced. The naans were good. 

Service was not as expected. The person who seated us hustled us to our table in a rushed manner. The whole restaurant was empty when we arrived but he seemed stressed. I would not come here again because of food taste and service. Also its quite expensive for what u get.

I came here as there were good reviews but my experience was something else."}
{"text":"Solid 5 stars -- exceeded expectations in terms of service, ambience, food quality.

Upon walking into the restaurant, staff are exceptionally welcoming and offer to take our jackets. We were then escorted to our reserved seats, and less than 30 seconds after our waiter came and introduced the context of their restaurant and dishes. Adrak is a family run Indian restaurant, and every dish, sauces, bread-- everything-- is made from scratch upon ordering to ensure top quality and freshness (they asked for our patience as the kitchen is slower because of this). Luckily, we had an earlier reservation, so waiting wasn't too big of a problem.

The  waiter detailed the origins and tastes of recommended dishes for newcomers, and was very pleasant. We ordered the Chicken Malai Tikka tandoori, and the Gosht Rogan Josh curry (lamb) with garlic naan and roomali roti. The chefs offered mini potato bites and crispy naan on the house while we waited for our food. It was also spectacular because the chefs making naan and roti were separated by a glass window, so we watched them throw the dough around and spin it.

The food did not fail to impress. The chicken tandoori was very moist and juicy on the insides, with the mint sauce and herbs just hit the spot entirely for me. Garlic naan was also very good. I'm not sure which dish was better. But the goat curry was so delicious too...it's like they experimented and made every possible texture and taste at its best. Everything was perfect.

Overall, this newly opened restaurant lived up to the hype, BOTH of a high-end restaurant and also in terms of the quality of Indian food. Beat Bindia by 10 miles, literally.

They even \"grow\" their wetnaps for you at the end--the entire dining experience was magical. You'll know what I mean when you go.

Try it out!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to Adrak, the first time being in August. Our server informed us that they changed the menu, and he seemed to know it very well. Overall he was very polite, I wish I had gotten his name to recommend here. I was a bit nervous after reading other reviews. My friend was so surprised when our server offered to pour his beer for him. Perhaps they've read the reviews and realized that quality service counts!

The food was amazing! The prices may seem a bit high, but the portions are huge! One of the BEST butter chickens in the city. They don't skimp on the chicken either. Don't be fooled by the appearance of lobster and prawns plate, there are indeed many BIG shrimp hidden in there. :)

Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Came here on a double date. I had the butter chicken with saffron rice and it was okay. It was good but wasn't bad. Nothing special. 
My boyfriend had goat and garlic naan. Can't go wrong with garlic naan. 
Anyway for four people. I paid $100. No alcohol. Just a mango juice for one guy at the table. 
It's a little more expensive but I thought it was okay since the restaurant was clean and quiet. 

My server wasn't Indian. Is that weird or is it just me??"}
{"text":"So I am indeed a fan of Adrak but be warned at the outset that this review is served with a large helping of bitter herbs. 

Adrak (the word for ginger in a number of Indian languages) gets it very very right, when it gets it right. 

Velvety Kham Khatai galouti kebabs slow dance with your tongue. An okra appetizer, dusted with masala for bite, is a delicious tango; a tart vinaigrette cutting across the crunch of its deep-fried provenance. The aloo tikki trio is really the humble potato in a menage a quatre, spicing up its mundane existence, by getting into the same plate with spinach, lentils and paneer. It's good clean fun. 

The prawn dum biryani is a perfectly arranged marriage between long-grained basmati and seafood. They were made for each other everyone will say wisely. It arrives, as all good marriages do, in a balloon of heat and appetite. Prawn and rice have been cavorting wantonly in each other's liquids behind the purdah of the naan that seals the dish in which they are cooked. The waiter cuts this open at the table. Fragrant steam rises into your face shamelessly when the veil is lifted. It is quite the sexpot of a dish. The lamb version of the same dish didn't please me in quite the same way - I found the lamb a touch too dense, the cubes too large - I prefer my lamb to melt upon sight of me. On my to-review list: the lamb shank biryani. 

Speaking of lamb, I must dwell for a moment on the Chaamp Taajdaar - frenched, fenugreeked (See that? That's multiculti wordplay friends) lamb chops that keep every promise the menu made about them. 

So why the caveat at the outset? Why three stars? Let's say I was hit hard by a low-flying duck. Admittedly duck is tricky. But the tandoori marinated duck breast sounded delicious. So I ordered it. A big mistake. The waiter came back around 10 minutes later to say it would take 15 minutes longer than everyone else's order. We had time. Which eventually, after a fair bit of waiting, ran out. The duck arrived. It was not a perfect, succulent, springy duck breast but a small drumstick, a large wing, and the breast. It was short on salt. It was charred more than tandoori should be. And boy, it was tough. Tough like a weightlifting 70 year old lady in a leopard-skin body suit. I took a bite of the drumstick, and stopped. Good Indian boy that I am, I wasn't going to waste any food. I had them pack it up. 

I took it home and pressure cooked (yes! pressure cooked!) that bird into submission. I will add some mayo to it and create my own curried duck salad. It's a shame, but the only thing that stopped Adrak from getting a whole-hearted four stars from me was that bit of fowl play. Now you know."}
{"text":"We were in the area on a Saturday evening and thought we would check it out.  The ambience was perfect as it brings a Toronto vibe to the suburbs.  After being seated we noticed the drink menu detailed a wide variety of Indian based options.  We ordered a few of these drinks and were surprised by how well the flavors were emphasized.  The food menu was just as spectacular with items having the right amount of spice we requested.  The host and staff were more than attentive and accurate with our orders.  The rumali roti chef prepares his signature dish through a glass window that can be viewed and enjoyed by customers with authenticity that can only be found at Adrak.  
I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to Adrak for my dad's birthday dinner on a Tuesday night around 8pm. The restaurant was empty except for one other group so there was no wait to get a table. We started off with apps: Aloo Papri Chaat, Potato Tikki Trio and Masala Fries. They weren't amazing. The tikki trio was supposed to be three different preparations/flavours of aloo tikki but tbh they all tasted the same. The masala fries were good for a crowd but it was just normal french fries dusted with parmesan cheese and served with mango chutney to dip. Nothing special and either of those are definitely not worth $9. The chaat was good tho, with pomogranete seeds and thin strips of beets on top to garnish.

For mains we ordered: Shahi Kadhai Paneer, Cabbage Manchurian, Kashmiri Aloo and Malai Kofta.  My favourite was the manchurian, hands down. It was seasoned really well with a sweet spicy sauce and all the pieces were nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Paired with garlic naan, it was amazing. The kashmiri aloo also had an amazing cream sauce that had the right balance of sweet and spicy. Portions are decent for the mains but naans are priced individually which is odd. We ordered 6 naans for 6 people.

We got masala chai to end the meal and it wasn't very good. Pretty watery and not something I'm used to when drinking indian tea. 

Overall, the ambiance and food was great but in my opinion, skip apps and go straight for the mains."}
{"text":"Would I come back? Yes.

LOCATION
------------------------
Food was delicious and the space is really classy. Warning that it is a little hard to find because it looks like an office building and by the time you see the restaurant's sign, you've already gone too far; you'll have to take a few right turns to get there.

FOOD
------------------------
By far, the best dish we ordered was the paneer makhanwala (cubes of homemade cheese simmered in a creamy sweet + spicy Tomato sauce - $17). It's vegetarian, but was the favourite at our table among meat eaters too. 

We also ordered the non-veg platter and meat & seafood sampler platters. At $45 each, they were a good way to try multiple things on the same dish, but for the taste, portion size, and overall enjoyment, I would choose individual dishes like the paneer makhanwala next time. 

We paired our orders with multiple types of rice and naan; you really can't go wrong choosing any of them. 

SERVICE
------------------------
All the staff were very friendly and eager to serve. This isn't the servers' fault, but the restaurant was less than 10% full and we waited maybe half an hour for our food. If the restaurant was full, I'm not sure how they could possibly keep up with orders.

RESERVATIONS
------------------------
They have OpenTable, but I don't know if they restrict it intentionally because there were no reservations available when I tried, but I called and they were wide open. When we arrived, it was 90% empty, so I'm not sure how their online reservation system works.

OVERALL
------------------------
The restaurant downtown pricey, but the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent portions
We had the butter chicken, chicken tikka marsala, and chicken tikka cooked with bell peppers and tomatoes.  Sides of Garlic Naan were fresh, made on site.  Rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  One Rice serving could probably be enough for two people. Best butter chicken we've had.

Great friendly service.  High priced but meets the high quality.  Portion sizes were more than adequate.  Had leftovers to take home.

Would definitely come again!"}

Service: 5/5
Food: 5/5 
Atmosphere: 5/5
Speed of order : 5/5

Overall it is a great decor and wonderful place for a fine Indian food experience.  
Our server is very attentive and able to offer what they can do to satisfy our taste.  The glass see through kitchen catches my eyes on how they barbeque our fish ( we order the whole fish bbq) and it is quite an enjoyment for customers like us who love to see the process of cooking.

It is a gem in Richmond Hill and plenty of parking it offers around the building where the restaurant located at the bottom of the commercial building.  Quite a great dining experience.  Thankful to Yelpers reviews and allowed us to select this Indian cuisine and turned out a good dining experience for us

We ordered a lentil soup, great flavour with spice. The spice didn't cover up the lentils at all.  The soup tasting offered to us ~ a shot of cream of tomatoes, great food business technique.  

We also ordered one curry tikka masala, taste right with flavorful spices.  We like naan esp their mixed veggie naan, great taste. Just we find it a little bit oily.  Overall tastes are flavorful just right.  Grilled fish is ok. It was a little bit under cooked but the server and chef offered to cook the new whole fish for us . However we didn't wanna waste food so we just wanted them to cook well the fish.  It was pleasantly well handled and fixed by the chef . 

We also had masala tea. Good they didn't add sugars. Some places does add sugars so its not good you cannot control what you like.

I would return and hope you will try it out."}
{"text":"Love the food and amazing service but the food is way too expensive in my opinion ! I would go there on special occasions."}
{"text":"Great place to sit and enjoy a decent meal. Complimentary cheese balls were very good. Although, the food is over-priced. The patiala fish, doesn't go well with the creamy gravy, oI just wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  Onion kulcha's were not a 100% authentic but tasted good. Best past were the saffron rice, they used a lot of genuine saffron with lots of flavour. The food was not extraordinary, thats why its over-priced."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I have been to an Indian restaurant. This one is on the upscale side. Everything from cutleries to furniture to service is fancy. Family friendly. Food is a bit pricey for the portions.

I asked the waiter what is vegan friendly and he listed few options. Not bad but I was expecting more vegan friendly dishes from an Indian restaurant. I ordered Gobi aloo (picture below) and it was a OK.

Overall it was a nice dining experience. If you are a fan of Indian food then I suggest that you check it out."}
{"text":"I had first visited Adrak, a fusion of Sub-Continental Spice and Mughal treatment of meat dishes..was very impressed by both quality and presentation of the food.. Loved the JHEEnGaa aka shrimp Masala, the famous DUM biryani, the NonVeg Thali, and many more dishes. However, recently, went out for dinner at the same place, and ordered the King of all Entr√©es.. A full Roast Leg of Lamb, famously known as RAAN-E-Sakander ( means Leg of Alexander the great).. It is a special order as it takes hours to prepare  ( marinate the leg of lamb with herbs and spices ). , then slow roasted for hours, and the result was mouth watering meat coming off the bone, served with premium Basmati rice infused with Saffron, Naans, side dish of Daal Makhani ( buttered Lentil). This was followed by great Pistachio Kulfi ( ice cream dessert)..

Must have dish... Though the price tag on Raane-Sikandar is a hefty $70 but it is worth spending.. Good enough for 2-3 people.

Cheers"}

Will definitely be back ... wow"}
{"text":"Just updating my review since my last time at Adrak. Came here with my boyfriend for dinner on a friday evening, and as soon as we entered we were asked if we have reservations, which they are very particular about. The restaurant was almost empty besides 4 tables being full, but they still shunned us and were a little weird about us not having reservation. We were seated and the service was okay, however they have changed their dishes since my last visit. The chicken pakoora, and paneer pakora were great. However, their chicken tikka has changed and become very dry, and has way too much flavour going on, whereas before it had great flavours and came on a little grill. Also, the server was pretty judgy about the fact that I got the chicken pakora as my main, since I wasn't too hungry. 
Overall I think this establishment thinks really highly of themselves which in reality I don't think they should so."}
{"text":"Adrak is a newcomer on the GTA Indian food scene; in two visits here this place shows promise but requires a little polish to reach glorious heights. I've tried the lunch thali and several dishes in a group setting for dinner. Off the bat I would definitely recommend dinner as I found lunch to be a bit overpriced and nowhere near as flavourful as the dinner dishes. 

Our large group arrived for dinner on a Saturday night and the place seemed to have a decent buzz. There is no doubt that the d√©cor here is chic, upscale, and modern; perfectly straddling the line between East and West. Our group of 6 decided to order one dish each so we could taste a few things. My favourite dishes were the Malai Kofta and the Baingan Bharta. The Malai Kofta was perfectly creamy, with a rich sauce and great nutty flavours from the dumplings. The baingan was out of this world good, great smokiness from the eggplant with a nice kick from the spices. Chicken tikka masala and lamb vindaloo where good but not great, the lamb while quite spicy was a bit greasy. The Punjabi daal makhni (spiced lentil dish) was not good, pretty bland and definitely my least favourite dish on the night. It is important to note that each dish is available in 4 spice levels so one can adjust to their tolerance. The price was slightly higher than what I'm used to at similar establishments but the larger portions and astounding ambiance justify this. 

The service was, in a word, clumsy. What our server lacked in finesse he certainly made up for in persistence, constantly asking if we wanted alcohol and being seemingly disappointed that the answer was a unanimous \"no.\" However he soon moved from alcohol to dessert only to be dismayed that we were simply here for dinner. Although I appreciate that he has to try and push alcohol and dessert as that's where the real profit margin is, some training about how to do this properly needs to be implemented. Despite the few bumps along the way (and the proclamation that our waiter hates eggplant, after we ordered an eggplant dish) the service was efficient and attentive. They also have an extensive cocktail menu and in house \"mixologist\" which is a nice touch. 

Overall will I be back, probably in the distant future but this place certainly has promise as long as they can iron out the kinks.

{"text":"Came here for lunch with some co-workers. Good food, service, atmosphere/decor but on the pricey side. Definitely give it a try but I wouldn't say it's an everyday lunch spot. Come here if you want to treat yourself to nice Indian food and good service. I wish they had some lunch specials like most Indian places. I will not hesitate to come back. Tip: if coming on a weekend for dinner make sure you make reservations well in advance."}
{"text":"I must say, the etiquette of the food is on point. It's not common to find food with such fines in a place like Richmond Hill. I was quite satisfied with the portions and knew very well that I was paying for upscale dining (so I anticipated smaller portions), but this was great. The restaurant itself, had a nice ambience; however, I would have appreciated some candles and lower lighting. The washrooms were gross, they definitely need to upgrade that. Finally, the services was rather mediocre. I wasn't impressed by my waiters and the service was slow. All-in-all, great food, great portions, great ambience; nice waiters and very friendly, they just need to be a  little on their A-game."}
{"text":"Warning this is going to be a long post...

Maybe they dont get much non Indian customers here?
My skeptical side is saying their intentions  were to try to upsell and rack up the bill as much as possible. :S 

We made reservations for dinner and when we got here we didn't make any request or indicatation that we wanted help with ordering. Throughout dinner the manager and wait staff kept making other suggestions to what we originally wanted. So for that I found the dining experience over all was rather uncomfortable and not that relaxing. 

I'll begin with the starter. We try to order the appetizer meat platter to share but the waiter immediately says no you guys will like the seafood /meat platter more. Okay, how would he know? It's on the menu in clear English next to what we ordered but anyways we give his suggestion a try and order the seafood meat platter instead. 

Minutes later the manager comes by to tell us how he has something special for us to go on the platter. Some kind of special large prawns (does a very wide hand gesture) on a skewer instead of just the regular shrimp side that normally came with the platter. We ask him is this part of the platter or extra? He gives a very ambigious no-mix-yes head shake gesture without telling us the exact cost. Half of our table thought he said no the other half thought he said yes then no?? So, they weren't upfront about the price difference here at all. Well fine, I thought surely if it's extra it can't be outrageous. We find out at the end that the skewer with 5 shrimps 4 of which made it on the table was $25.00 AND they really weren't that good, shrimp meat actually tasted very harsh metallic flavor. He dropped one on the floor as he was serving it and walked away without saying a word. Fine, I didn't miss it but he didn't adjust the price or acknowledge it in anyway. 

Next, we try to place the entree order. He seemed rather reluctant and disapproving with most of our choices and made some initial effort to make suggestions for some special items not on the menu that the kitchen could make especially for us. My friend had to interrupt and say, \"I really think we are really ready to order right now\". Does he think we came here to NOT eat things from their menu? The tone just seemed rather presumptuous. 
 
We try to order regular naan but again the manager recommends a Afghan style naan to go with everything. Saying it will be amazing which again the price was not disclosed. It was $8 each btw we find out at the end. And it was the exact SAME size as regular naan but flattened and pulled out to one side. So at that time another waiter swipes in with perfect timing and says oh, that doesn't look like enough you'll need more right? Yes, it's quite obvious isn't it?

There was one winning dish though which we had to adamently push for to be ordered. Vegetarian paneer kofta with cashew sauce. If I ever do get over this experience I would come back for this dish alone.

The manager comes back to check on us mid dinner and this time grinning ear to ear. \"Oh you like crab too right? We made zero indication that we liked crab to him. He goes on \"next time you come back I will help make you a very good Crab curry.\" this is also not on the menu. This crab pitch is repeated to us again as we finish paying and get up to leave. The hustle is real here.

Only come if you are ready to fend off upselling or be ready to splurge. Dinner came to $190 tip not included for 4 people with 3 non alcoholic beverages."}
{"text":"Why haven't I reviewed this wonderful restaurant yet! Excellent food and great ambience. They have big clear glass window to some sections of their kitchen which gives an amazing view of the chef making fresh Indian breads and tandoor. Very neat, cozy lights and candles with instrumental music. Fancy eh..What more can one ask for here? 

Adrak is One out of very few Indian restaurants in GTA which gives you a feeling of a high end professional restaurant experience. The food taste very delicious and service was high standards. We were feeling very generous to tip them however they accepted tips ONLY in cash even if you paid through your Card. They totally deserved to be tipped. Sadly we didn't carry cash with us. But I would definitely make it up to them next time I go in.

Yes it's pricey but the quality and quantity is upto the mark. So I don't mind paying little extra price than the other restaurants. I save it for a special day and would not make it a regular place. Trust me, Being a vegetarian and an Indian this is one of very few places in GTA with such good food quality. It does tastes like made by a professional chef than some unskilled labour working part-time to pay off his tuition. Yeah I know! That sucks. 

They gave complimentary tomato basil soup in shot glasses. It was yummy. Not too tangy nor sweet, Just right! The dishes we ordered were appetizer- Soya Malai Chaap (all I can say about this dish is MUST TRY) Main course- Paneer Makhanwala (rich, creamy, hint of extra spiciness we asked for) Panchratna Dal (Mmuuuaahh) and for drinks- Virgin Mojito with Garlic Naan n vegetables Stuffed Kulcha Bill was around $85 (Excluding TIP) We definitely had left overs enough for next day's lunch.

Can't wait to go back there!! I hope next time we have same or even better experience. My last visit has given me high hopes towards you Adrak..!!"}
{"text":"Walked in and greeted nicely and seated fairly quickly. Got a little sampler soup which was nice.  The dinner was off to good start.  

Our okra salad was nice.  We ordered the veg tandoori platter, a curry and roti.

The curry wasn't bad and the roti was fresh.  So far so good.  Then we started to dig into the platter.  Halfway through we noticed the stuffed potato had an off smell and taste to it.  We brought it up the waiter took rest of platter away and then the ordeal began.

The waiter told the manager we didn't like it and finished the whole platter.  Both were not true.  He decided not to clarify the story with the manager.  So when the bill came nothing was taken off.  He said he would remove the item when we brought up again. After bringing it up with waiter manager came over and one didn't believe us that the food had gone bad and gave the impression we were trying to squeeze a free dish.  Eventually the bill came back with a % off.  Not equivalent to the dish we ordered.  So we demanded we get the rest of the platter back since he was being an ass and making a big deal not to just comp their screw up.  

I tried to clarify what happened but he didn't want to hear it and kept on interrupting me.  Eventually he comp'd the dish which he should've done in the first place.  We ate half the dish and could have got sick. Even after all that no one apologized for any of the mess up.

Other small things like asking for tamarind and not getting plus waiter pouring water into my plate without apologizing or offering to get me a new plate.  

Halfway thru I was ready to recommend this place but bad service plus spoiled food left a bad taste. Surprising this is how issues are resolved.  Not a repeat customer here.  And will not recommend to others.  

Go to another Indian restaurant and save a few bucks while you're at it.

**next day update: one of us has mild food poisoning from the spoiled item we ate."}
{"text":"My coworker and I decided last minute, that we wanted some Indian food so we came across this restaurant that was just  a few minutes away! We were immediately greeted as we walked in and was asked if we had reservations (they might only do reservations on busy nights). A few minutes after ordering the waiter came out and gave us a complimentary Risotto Paneer Rice Ball ( at least that's what I think he said... he had me at Paneer). Anyways, we then got our mains which was fantastic! I ordered the Paneer Makhan Waalan with Butter Naan, very fresh! My coworker ordered her usual Butter Chicken with plain rice, which she also found very good! 

I don't't usually comment on the decor, but we had a very good first impression, because of how fancy it was. We felt like we were on a date. hehe I recommend this place if you're looking for a nice restaurant to out someone special.
 
Last but not least, I noticed a man by the entrance thanking all the customers for dining with them. He made sure, everyone walking out had a good time! (you don't't see that very often anymore)

All in all, the restaurant really impressed me and I would certainly go back!!"}
{"text":"A good Italian restaurant becomes a good Indian restaurant.  Adrak is an upscale Indian restaurant in the base of a multi storey building right on Highway 7--but entered from the back side on Werthiem Court, so it is not as well known as it could be.

A late lunch brought me in when the place was nearly empty.  It retained its classy look from years ago, with a kitchen behind glass, and a tidy little bar off the building lobby.

Looking at the one other table that had ordered food, I liked what I saw and was forced to choose between a Thali and a platter about 2 square feet in area.  The platter won.

I ordered the Shrimp Curry, medium heat.  The platter had a bowl of curry and shrimp, accompanied by a small salad, Basmati rice, and Naan bread (choice of plain or garlic).  The curry contained 3 of the largest shrimp I have ever seen outside of the seafood counter at St Lawrence Market.  Even though the shrimp (prawns?) were very large, they were cooked well.  They were definitely not tender, but that is common with really big shrimp, not the fault of the kitchen.

Overall, the platter and an iced tea came out to $18.  I can't decide if it is better than Bombay Bhel, but it is slightly more expensive.  I would reserve Adrak for business guests if I wanted the upscale environment for entertainment."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars

Came here with a group for dinner.  We did the sensible thing and ordered a bunch of different dishes so we could share.

- Chicken biryani
- Lamb Biryani 
- butter chicken
- chicken tikka masala
- salmon tikka 
- non vegetarian mixed platter (various apps)
- garlic naan 
- eggplant curry

Overall everything was pretty tasty - the tikka masala I think was probably the best dish.  The biryanis were also pretty good and the eggplant curry had a delicious spicy kick to it!  The biryanis came in pots with a naan like bread covering the tops.  I've never seen it presented that way so it was interesting. 

The service was a bit slow, but we were a larger group.  Also the kitchen is see through so we could tell our naans were being made fresh.  

At the end we ordered masala chai ($4).  I'm sorry but I'm not sure on what planet this is masala chai.  The fragrances of cardamom, cinnamon, cloves etc, just weren't there.  Save your $4!  We didn't even finish the tea."}
{"text":"Maybe I have been spoiled in the past or maybe my expectations were just too high but I really don't see why this place exists; it serves no purpose. Having spent 3 years of my life in Mississauga and blessed to have some of the best Indian eats in and around the area I can confidently say this place was a waste of my time.
Ridiculous prices, painfully slow service and food that is mediocre at best. My butter chicken and naan was around $20 when it's all said and done. While the sauce was alright the chicken tasted like it came out of the dryer. The other curry chicken dishes were similar as well. The lamb was not worthy to be mentioned. The naan was probably the best part of the meal and it tasted okay.
Why is this place still in existence? And why is there a grand opening sign almost 2 years now after my first visit?? - I am perplexed!"}
{"text":"We just dined at Adrak for the first time tonight.  Friends took us there and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience, but with one exception.  

The atmosphere was that of a downtown restaurant and not a typical Indian restaurant. Our waiter was a really nice guy who gave us personal service and was attentive.  The food was very good and portions were generous; so much that it was worth the few extra dollars compared to other Indian restaurants we frequent.  We ordered the food with medium spice and it was perfect, not too much and not too little; The right amount of heat.  

We also had lychee mojitos that had a lot of ice, were very tasty but not very strong.

The exception to our delightful evening came when a staff member approached our table and asked us to vacate the table because another party were waiting for it.  Never had this ever happened to any of us.  We were shocked and were basically escorted out with a smile.  Of course we were invited to sit at the bar and order drinks (on our own dime,) but we couldn't linger at our table.  I'm actually still in shock over our unceremonious boot out the door.

If I owned a restaurant, I would not want that to be my clientele's last memory of my place of business.  Some re-thinking needs to happen at Adrak."}
{"text":"This is fairly a new restaurant. My and my friend family decided to go. It was a great indian cousin experience with delicious food. We have ordered appetizers, main course and desert. I highly recommend their chicken pakora and chaat papri. I have not eaten this clean and nice flavored chaat before. I am bit disappointed with serving size but overall taste was excellent. In main course dum biryani and sekh lamb kebab were amazing. Also, gajjar hawala and rad milai, I would give 10/10. Over all customer service was excellent and will go back again. It's bit pricey but quality of food and service you get it won't hurt. Thanks"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Poor management. They messed up two entrees, yet no apology or rectifying the mistake. They refused to change our tables even after a request. The table we were on was too big for our group, and the restaurant was empty. They refused to serve naans, rice or dessert because they were closing kitchen in 15 minutes. This is AFTER our curries were served. They tried to rush us from the moment we got to the restaurant because they were closing in an hour - including the manager who came to twice to tell us that they were closing so we should order! Really? This is terrible. Our bill was $180 but and was so not worth it! Horrible customer service! Bad management. 

The training that the staff has received by the management for the restaurant of this class is inadequate to live up to the standards. We traveled one hour to go for dinner.

Great food but lousy client service."}
{"text":"I came to this place as a suggestion from a friend he told me it is one of the best Indian food in the area. The place has been ranked as the top food in Richmond hill for the past two years. The place is over hipped and it did not match my expectation that does not make it bad it is just I expected it special and really good food. I ordered the butter chicken and it was ok too much species which made me feel weird for sometime after. The place is really nice and well organized. The owner is sooo friendly and welcoming which was nice. The service is nice but I did not feel much traditional other than the food the design seem high class restaurant the price was high the butter chicken was 15 buck with no rice or break which is extra 3 dollars for one piece. Which I think is over priced. Overall the place was ok maybe I will try different order and see how it goes."}
{"text":"We had dinner here a week ago and it looks like I forgot to post the review. Here it is: 
The food is OK - I've had better Indian cuisine at many other places. The butter chicken is nothing special and the lamb roga josh did not have much flavour at all which was surprising for me because I like it at other places, but I won't be having it here again. 
The prices are fairly high for what it is. 
The decor is pretty modern and nice inside. 
We received very good service, however we were one of two tables that were there so they did not have any other tables to tend to. Overall, I think the food is good, not great, and the service was pretty good, so I would consider coming here if someone else wanted to, but otherwise I would much rather eat at the competitors across the street."}
{"text":"Went to Adrak tonight to celebrate my mother's birthday. The restaurant is modern with lovely decor and atmosphere. The food was delicious, not overly spiced but very flavourful. We ordered the tandoori platter which had an assortment of meats including lamb, chicken and shrimp grilled to perfection in their tandoor oven. We were seated right in front of the kitchen and watching the chef cook was such a highlight. He took such care in preparing the food, naans were made fresh to order and all meats were cooked in the tandoor. Lee also ordered chicken tikka and a vegetable curry. All delicious. The biriyani was also plated beautiful in a black pot that looked small but there was plenty.  The service made the dining experience over the top. Our waiter was informative and attentive. They also do this great magic trick at the end of the meal to provide you with a wet wipe that appears and grows as water is added. It was a nice finishing touch. Overall, it was a great dining experience, yes, it is more than your average Indian restaurant but the service is what made a difference for me. If you are looking for Indian fine dining, this place is a great choice!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with some clients and colleagues last night, excellent service and food was fantastic Adrak has great Ambiance and very good staff who paid a lot of attention to us 

Try the Fish Vindaloo, lamb and Kababs for sure"}
{"text":"So on a Friday night my husband decided to surprise me and took me to this gem straight from his office. He heard great reviews from his colleagues and I must say they were all right! We started with karari bhindi (crispy fried baby okra with onions green peppers and chaat masala) as a starter. It was soooo tasty and crispy. The best starter I hv ever had in any Indian restaurant in Toronto. The size of each fried okra was less thn 3cm which I never found in any grocery shops here. Thn our main course was typical paneer tikka sabji with garlic naan. The quantity was enough to feed 2 ppl easily. It was creamy,flavourful and so fresh. Both items from the menu were awesome. Thn we thought of trying a Parda Biryani. it was not as good as the two previous dishes but not bad at all... It had all flavours of an ideal veg biryanis but I found it little bit less salty... It was more on a sweeter side I would say... I would definitely travel every week from Brampton to Richmond just for their karari bhindi..Must try if u love nice authentic Indian food..."}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary.  We have been here many times before and were surprised to find that the lamb biriyani (which we have all the time), was now full of veggies (red and yellow peppers as well as big chunks of onion).  We were not impressed.  This is just a way to serve less meat and more vegetables.  We were disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a lovely early Sunday dinner this past weekend. Everything was beyond amazing, exceeding all of our expectations by far. The restaurant is now in our list of top five within the GTA. We will be returning many times in the future.

We ordered: Murgh Makhni, Saag Paneer, Lamb Roghan Josh, Basmati Rice, Garlic Naan, and drinks. Three people dining for $90 with lots of leftovers after very full bellies."}
{"text":"Came here last night with my boyfriend. We were both very excited to try a new Indian restaurant, and so decided to come here because of the good reviews. 
We ordered the samosas, chicken korma, and chicken vindaloo with rice, roti, and garlic naan. In all honesty, the samosas were extremely thick and oily, and were too 'fancy' for my liking. We both couldn't finish the samosas as they were upsetting our tummies. The curries were good but nothing unforgettable, I have had similar quality curries for much less of the price. As well, all the naan, roti, and rice come at an additional price which I was surprised about. Again, nothing too special about these items either, I actually found the roti very dry and bland. 
In terms of service, we felt very rushed the entire time we were here. The card machine does not accept tips, so you have to pay tips using cash. I found this to be quite inconvenient, especially if you do not have cash on hand. 
Overall, this place was a disappointment. You are essentially paying for the nice decor, but I would much rather prefer good food at reasonable prices and friendly service. This place is definitely NOT worth the price, as a dinner for two came up to $100 with no alcohol. This would have been understandable had the food been quality and the service friendlier."}
{"text":"Very delicious. They accommodated our party of 8, including 1 infant, even though we didn't have a reservation (btw - highly recommend you make a reservation as this place books up). We had the appetizer mixed platter, which included deep fried mixed veggies, and really yummy mint and tamarind dip. For dinner, I had chicken tikka masala (the BEST I've ever had) and my family had chicken parda biryani, veggie parda biryani, butter chicken, and chicken paroda (spelling?), along with several different naan variations. My favorite was the garlic naan. Everyone was raving about their meals. It was truly excellent! Service was respectful and prompt. The restaurant is very modern, contemporary and clean. I highly recommend Adrak if you're looking for high quality Indian food!!  Will definitely come back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today with a group of coworkers. They didn't have the lunch specials shown on their website anymore so we had to take a few extra mins to decide what to eat. I got the non vegetarian thali which included tandoori chicken tikka, lamb curry, salad, daal (lentil stuff), raita (yummy yogurt sauce), naan and rice for $14. Couldn't finish it but I tried. The chicken tikka was prob the best part. It was green instead of the usual red but it was freshly made right in front of us. Flavour was awesome and the meat was tender. I could've ate a whole plate of just that. Lamb curry was also good but I would've liked a bit of spice since everything was mild. Everything else was pretty standard to a thali dish and there was also a gulab jamun as the dessert sweet. This is basically like a denser timbit soaked in syrup but in a good way. The service was good but the food took about 20 mins to come out which normally would be fine but we only had an hour lunch so be prepared for that. I will def be coming back for the tandoori!"}
{"text":"Beyond amazing foods. My gosh the food was so good and ricj. Malai kufta was super good. The desert beyond yummmmm
Will be back"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday when they first opened and I could see some improvement needed in terms of the staffs experience. We were the only table there during the weekday night. 

I ordered the butter chicken and had add garlic Naan as the main does not come with anything.. I found this place to be quite pricey a butter chicken and Naan meal easily comes up to over $20.. Very expensive for Indian food.. But it was indeed quite delicious. The portion of the butter chicken  is quite large.. Enough for me to take some home and have with rice the next day. 

This restaurant situated on Highway 7 but it can be hard to get in as you have to get in from the back of the commercial building"}
{"text":"Ordered lamb seekh kebab and madras murgh.

The seekh kebab was just ok. The madras murgh was flavourful.

Great service...our waiter for really good.

Reason for taking off stars is because of the price. We also had 1 naan and rice and our bill was 45 bucks! Way too much for two people for an appetizer and main."}
{"text":"Oh goodness gracious, I can't say enough about this restaurant. 

I ordered the saag paneer (what else is new) with rice and a kingfisher beer. It was delish. If you don't ask about the done-ness, they will cook your curry to a medium flavour. It was perfect for me. Just enough heat to make things exciting. 

The price was definitely fair for the portion size. There was enough rice to share among a small village between my sis and I. She devoured the garlic naan. It smelled too good. There were plenty of paneer chunks too; many large cuts.

In short form, I'll go back!"}
{"text":"This place recently opened and it looks like they're still tinkering with a few details, but overall it's a great experience. The d√©cor and space here are elegant and simple - an ideal setting for a small group. The chef personally visited our table to advise on gluten free dishes and he clearly knew what he was talking about. We ordered several items for sharing and they were all great, but my favourites were the Baingan Bharta and Paneer Makhan Waala...simply amazing! 

On an amusing note, a self-described \"greatest mixologist in the GTA\" arrived at our table and didn't hold back on sharing his extensive qualifications. I'm not sure he's the best fit for this business but I can't blame them for trying. Our extremely attentive server earnestly recommended the most expensive dish in every category and urged us to order \"alcohol\" a few times. With a little practice he'll likely find a lighter touch wins more hearts and minds. He was embarrassed to learn that the Baingan Bharta was a hit around the table after specifically recommending that we not order it. They forgot to bring out one of our naan bread orders but quickly did so once we told them.

I would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Food was pricey but delicious. Presentation and atmosphere is classy. A great spot to try out indian food.
Been there 4 times and the servers were always very welcoming and nice each time. They always had the patience to explain each dish to me (im not indiam). Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Upscale Indian Food Restaurant. From the moment we arrived, staff were very nice. Great service. Our waiter helped us with our food selection. There was so much to choose from on the menu. The kitchen was glass encased so you could watch the chefs prepare the food. The presentation of each dish was as appetizing as the food itself. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Might be a bit tricky to find if you listen to Siri et al. because it will bring you to the back of the office building it is located and where there is nothing but a small sign to guide your way.  

I was there on a Wednesday night where it was moderately busy but not crazy so the service was good and I didn't feel rushed. 

We had a combination of tandoori (which you can see prepared in the open kitchen) and curries.  

Good

The matter panner and Punjabi Dal Makhni were excellent. The first was very traditional and the latter was laced with butter.....mmmmm...butter.

The Bhatti Da Murgh (chicken legs) were probably the best of the tandoori and the salmon tikka deserves honorable mention as did the Smokey Baingan Bharta.

Not as good

The Adraki Mushroom Tikka Masala was disjointed (I like a uniform curry) and the lamb was (keeping in mind I'm not a lamb fan) ok and overpriced. 

In the end, it's a decent choice for Indian food just off the 407, especially if you are having a business meeting and are leery of some of the hole in the wall places in the area. It is clean, has an open kitchen (you can watch the tandoori grill and the bread fry) and a unique cocktail menu."}
{"text":"I took friends who came from out of town on a Wednesday and the place didn't have half of the items on the menu. Gobi manchurian - were told that's a saturday special. Aloo Tikki Trio - that's a weekend special. Chicken Tikki - that's a weekend special. Bread basket - we don't have it. They are never consistent with the Lime Sodas - sometimes very sour and spicy, other times extremely watered down. Tandoori chicken had the perfect texture but not so flavorful like how you get in New Delhi. Quite disappointed although this was my 10th visit. It's progressively gotten worse."}
{"text":"I came here for an early dinner with my wife today.  It was my first time and her 3rd.  

My wife is a vegan that is allergic to dairy,  so it can be challenging at times to find a place she will enjoy. 

The food was amazing.  We had the tandoori mushrooms, sagh with potatoes,  garlic naan and biriyani rice.  I highly recommend the Tandoori mushrooms!

Highlights:
- food tasted great and was not greasy at all
- being a new restaurant everything is brand new and very clean.  Extremely hygienic!
- The service was the best part.  Our waitor \"Ali\" was extremely friendly and even remembered my wife from her first visit.  She's pregnant, and he even remembered the gender of the child from their previous conversation weeks prior along with the fact that she had specific food restrictions.  

I have to admit I was a bit hesitant at first based on some other reviews I read about price and them constantly trying to get you to buy alcohol and pricier dishes.  This was not the case at all.  I even asked the waiter what he recommended and he was very honest.

My one negative was the pricing was a bit high and the portion sizes were quite small, but I guess someone has to pay for the nice decor :)

Overall, a pleasant experience and good food - but Bombay Bhel down the street still remains as my favourite spot in the area for Indian food!

***** Update as of July 1, 2015 *****

I came here with our family for a late Sunday lunch.  From our previous visits to now, the quality has deteriorated quite a bit.  The decor is still stunning,  but the food quality is not what it was a couple months ago.  The food was extremely salty, bland and I felt extremely bloated afterwards.   While the prices are still quite high.  

I think going forward I'll be sticking with my original favourite int he area - Bombay Bhel down the street."}
{"text":"After personal recommendations from friends and some reviews online, we tried Adrak this weekend. We happened to be there on one of the busiest nights and coupled with being new to business, there were obvious delays but nothing to turn us off.

Location: GPS directions took us to the back of an office building and we had to phone to find the way to the store front. They perhaps need brighter signage at the postal address entrance.

Ambience: Contemporary modern style of restaurant. Minimal decor. Elegant, inviting, classy which is welcome change from typical Indian restaurants (where you see elephants and other stereotypical indian symbols)

Service: Now, this is where they have  some work to do. For a restaurant of this style and image, servers need to be bit more trained and polished. They all appeared to be rushed, hurried with little attention to needs of the customer. Our drinks order took longer than reasonable. Servers didn't quite know the menu to help with suggestions. Bartender was kind to explain the mocktails but not accommodating to some requests.

Food Presentation: A+. Cutlery, plates, accessories were great quality. Plating was superb and so was the overall experience of looking at the food as it arrives at the table.

Food: All items we tried tasted very good. It's on par with the best Indian restaurants in the city. Bharwan Aloo Potohari, Veg. Galouti Kabab, Paneer Tikka from Tandoor were great choices. Rumali Roti, Garlic Naan, Mirch Parantha as breads complimented our main curries perfectly. Special mention for Malai Kofta, taste reminded me of back home. Dum Biryani is a must try. Note that the spice level is calibrated for western customers. So if you like spicy like Indian-spicy, ask for it. 

Value for money: Fair. Prices are at par with some of the fine dining Indian restaurants. Portions are slightly smaller but not too bad.

All in all, a very welcome new addition to fine dining Indian restaurants. Definitely worth repeating and worth recommending. With time, I am sure the kinks will be worked out and service will improve."}
{"text":"Great food ... I've eaten here for lunch a few times and really like the food.  It's served piping hot and is freshly prepared.  The veggie and chicken dishes we've had were delciious.  This is the best byrianni I've had in a restaurant.  Good naan.  The service is good also.  Cost is reasonable for quality of the food."}
{"text":"I am on a quest. 
A quest for the best butter chicken in all the land. 
Okay, in Toronto/GTA. 
I think I've found it here. The waiter said he was pleased with my choice and guaranteed it will be the best bc I've ever had. Why? \"We grow our own tomatoes for the recipe. Most restaurants used canned tomatoes. We don't.\"
Good God Almighty was he ever right. The chicken (although a little lacking in the quantity) was savoury and delicious. The sauce ...creamy, fulfilling. It's butter chicken crack. I asked for another order of garlic naan just to finish the sauce. 
Tip: one order of rice is enough for three people. And it comes in a sweet jar with a spoon for self serving. 
I forgot the name of what my friend ordered. I was too obsessed with my bc and piping hot garlic naan. I was in a blind food rage, greedily tearing at melt-in-your-mouth naan and gobbling up the perfectly delectable creamy sauce. 
The ambiance is very nice. Went for lunch with a friend on a Monday afternoon. We had the place to ourselves. 
You won't regret going if you're looking for an upscale Indian restaurant in Markham. Go. Do it!"}
{"text":"Every year, I have the...let's just say \"honor\" of visiting Richmond Hill for a conference, and every year I have a brief opportunity to sample its local restaurants.  After a depressing encounter with a local sushi restaurant earlier in the evening, and despite nearing my digestive limit, I insisted on finding something better.  That would be Adrak, and yes, it was better, and not marginally, but better like Mad Max: Fury Road being better than Transformers 4, like Texas barbecue being better than a rotten skunk found in the septic tank of a slaughterhouse.  Hungry?

 A year ago, I had just missed their grand opening.  Hell, I thought it was closed now, as one door was locked.  Inside I found posh fine Indian dining, a rarity I admit.  Although one could accuse Adrak's d√©cor as being inconsistent, I found it refreshing, not settling on the stalwarts of draping one's entire establishment in shades of brown.  Hints of grey and white can be found, an intelligent arrangement of tables, and an exposed kitchen.  

 About that, a large chunk of the kitchen was enclosed in glass, leading me to believe it was either a chef aquarium or a gigantic sneeze-guard.  In truth it was neither, more of a way to see the wonders of Indian cuisine without the misfortune of melting one's face off.  There were two tandoori ovens on display at the front, firing at over 600 degrees.  The naan was made right in front you, by far one of the coolest ideas I've seen in Indian restaurants...or maybe even restaurants in their entirety.  Posh bistros often have open kitchens to showcase cleanliness the proficiency of the kitchen staff.  However, with such a concept also creates a lot of noise pollution.  Adrak's solution is inspired and worthy of reproduction.  The menu was shockingly though pleasantly conservative, with barely half the options of normal Indian restaurants.  This was because of an approach more suited for made-to-order cuisine rather than the refrigerated variety, like those so often seen with buffets.  The prices were reasonable as well, perhaps almost too reasonable.  

 Having eaten not three hours prior, I was looking for something undersized and cheap, and those concepts are usually associated.  I expected most big dishes to orbit around $20, so I settled on ordering something circa $16.  I figured it was a solid play, focusing on a first page entry.  You can probably see where this is going...

 What I ended up getting was a dum- biryani, and for those unaware of what an authentic dum-buryani is, it's a rice dish prepared in iron pot about the size of...ohh...Thunderdome.  In it they pack rice, meat, and spices and then cook the entirety apparently on the surface of the sun.  The moisture is kept sealed not by an iron or ceramic lid but by naan dough that completely seals what's inside.  I've seen this practice done, but only on TV with Gordon Ramsay where they enclosed a goat...like a whole goat.  I've seen other places offer biryani, and they've all astounding, but never have I seen one presented traditionally in this manner.  And it was incredible, seriously fantastic...once I let it set for fifteen minutes to cool.  It put all other biryanis I've had to shame, even the ones I truly enjoyed.  It created an echelon I never knew existed.  Once experiencing paradise and then finding something better, what do you call it?     

 I downed it all with a tall glass of red, a recommended Yellow Tale shiraz out of Australia, a good pairing and one I'll be acquiring upon my return.  Despite only making it through half the dish and boxing the rest, I still made a point to order dessert.  Gulab Jamun over ice cream, a great dish if the confection hadn't entered the atmosphere thirty seconds prior.  It must be a thing with Adrak that they serve everything at the temperature of which gold particles fuse at the Large Hadron Collider.  Suffice to say the ice cream didn't remain intact very long.  Finally, to conclude the experience, I was served a small cup with what looked like a shriveled marshmallow.  I was about to assume it was some pallet cleaner until the server poured hot water over the cup and the towel expanded like one of those crappy dinosaurs that took a day to expand to the size of a mushroom.  That just raised Adrak outside of this reality.  From service, to d√©cor, to the meals served, Adrak is nothing short of perfection.  What a shame it resides across the country.  
 Three days later, as I sat under my hotel sign at 10 pm watching traffic, I devoured the remains of my microwaved leftovers, still a great mean in itself.

{"text":"I love this place. Authentic Indian cuisine nice environment. Great service and reasonably priced. 
The lunch menu is just as good as the dinner menu. 
You can watch the chefs working in the kitchen cooking which is always a bonus. 
I would happily recommend this place to anyone. 
Happy eating :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant in the GTA. Great ambiance, great food, great service.

The restaurant interior is stylishly decorated: nice furniture, fancy tableware, mood lighting, etc. There's a glass wall separating the dining tables from the kitchen, and it was cool being able to watch the chefs cook. The servers were very friendly and prompt, and they gave us good recommendations for food.

We ended up ordering the Aloo Tikki Trio (very good), the Tandoori Chicken (good), the Lamb Rogan Josh (excellent), and the Fish Vindaloo (good but quite spicy). As a side, we got garlic naan (tasty), and as a desert we got the Beetroot Halwa (unique - good, but I'd prefer something different next time). We split all of that amongst just the two of us and left very stuffed. You probably could get by with one less appetizer and/or no dessert and still have more than enough food.

Overall we had a fun time and would definitely come back. Give Adrak a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"All the hype. Does it live up to it?

So I pestered my friends to drive all the way to Markham to try the swanky new Indian joint. We arrived at 6.30pm on seemingly busy Sunday evening. Interiors are done in a trendy fashion so enjoy them, you're gonna pay for it.

Now, now. Its not bad by any standards. So hold on to your horses. The best part about Adrak is their cocktail menu. I love having perfect cocktails with Indian food because its a rare thing to happen to you.

Kaala Khatta is the first cocktail on the list and its absolutely fantastic. The squeaky tangy flavor of Indian Tamarind is dominant and it flourishes in your mouth long after you've taken a sip. 

Starters: Next best part. 

The Galouti Kebabs which I had been dying for were made to perfection. Soft, moist grounded meat which melts before you even try to chew on it. The Tandoori Platter is pretty standard but again, perfect! Last but not the least, Shrimps! Man O Man, what a relish. Have you tried Jumbo shrimps which were crisp and soft at the same time? Now I have.

So, why did I start this review with a sad face?

Main course! Although nothing wrong with it but it did not appeal to my Indian palates. Plenty of colors but it was as if they were afraid I'd sue if the main course happen to carry a punch.

Punjabi Daal Makhani and Chicken Lababdaar both were quite mild in flavor. Malai Kofta could have done without generous turmeric. 

Maybe it was my bad luck given that day they were out of Lamb, Goat and most of the desserts on the menu. I'm pretty sure about it because when I ordered another Pista Kulfi, they said I had the last one in stock already!

I might be back when someone wishes to throw me a treat. Or if wife drags me back for cocktails and appetizers!

P.S: Exceptional service. So please tip generously. The staff deserves it!

Update: June 25, 2015

Maybe its my bad luck that my second attempt to like Adrak failed miserably.
Came over with extended family to celebrate a birthday and ended up with drinks brought an hour after ordering.

Just 2 guys owning the floor. Apparently, entire staff was busy catering! 

Galouti kebabs amazing as always. They have changed names on the menu. Kala Khatta changed to Tamarind Cocktail. Plain n simple. Wife was disappointed a bit since it was served without spices and rose petals like the last time around.

Still, both the guys on the floor were trying their best. Maybe third time's a charm."}
{"text":"Never expected good indian food/restaurant in Richmond hill. Varun (manager) suggested some good dishes which our dinner amazing . We tried soya chaap which was soft and melting. Last time I had chaap was when I visited Chandigarh and never expected to eat here. Mirch baigan masala as main course was excellent. As I am not an eggplant fan but we took a risk to order this vegetable as was highly suggestedYes by Varun. Slow charcoal cooked eggplant tastes amazing and goes well with spicy gravy. Last but not the least Aam panna drink was excellent and loved every sip of it."}
{"text":"What an excellent restaurant!  The food is spectacular.  Their dishes are vibrant and very exciting.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is warm and cozy and the servers are wonderful***make sure you bring cash for their tips

Outstanding.  Can't say enough of nice things.  This restaurant is definitely worth a detour!"}
{"text":"We were craving Indian and chose this bc of yelp's pictures and reviews. This was a clean posh looking place, modern. The dishes on Yelp were not on the menu!!! Well a few were but some were not. We tried their signature RAAN 48 hr roast and it was just ok. We ordered their non vegetarian sampler platter but it looked nothing like the picture on Yelp and all the meat was DRY! So skip that dish for $28 it was a pathetic sampler. Butter chicken and chicken tikka masala were good thank goodness! Their breads were also good but on the pricey side. Okra salad could be skipped, all fried and salty with no fresh components. Fries for $9! Just a cup of fries with spices on it. That's all we ordered and bill was $200. Would I try this place again? Maybe one day but not soon. I like how we can see their cooks make the fresh Thin breads."}
{"text":"there is a reason why I love the adrak indian restaurant & bar the food is to die for.
my self and two of my friends was having dinner at adrak's and I have to say the food was
great and the price was right when you are in Richmond hill Ontario stop by the adrak indian restaurant you wont be sorry."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here for my birthday! 
I heard from a friend it was an amazing romantic classy restaurant so without hesitation we reserved a table of even checking the reviews!
Our server never came to check on the food.
I wanted to make a complaint because the food was so bland and had no flavour but he never stuck around long enough to listen.
He was a nervous wreck!
Our appetizer was too salty and the food had no flavour! 
For being in an Indian restaurant you would think there would be spices but there was nothing ..it looked nice and tasted and when you went to eat it .. disappointment ..
Very upset .. especially because we came for my birthday and it was suppose to be a special evening .. and it was not at all.
The owner was running around doing nothing.
The ambiance is nice but like we didn't pay for ambiance .."}
{"text":"Tried for first time ,very impressed on all accounts from decor to service to food selection and food taste . All dishes tasted authentic and flavourful ."}
{"text":"Good food, lots to choose from their dinner menu, great location, timely and courteous service. I went there with 3 of my friends and 3 of us tried biryani, the other tried vegetarian tandoori. The food portion seems to be relatively smaller compare to their price."}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to try this place during lunch time, we ordered the thailis and lamb curry... we like the presentation, the portion is good and the food is good, not sure if i am the expert on Indian cursine but I like it. The service is excellent, and we will come back again..."}
{"text":"I have been to quite a few Indian restaurants and this one by far beats the competition's quality, service and value.  Its menu is big enough to keep bringing you back,  interior decor is great and posh enough for a date or business meeting. They make their own naans and everything is just suoer tasty... John was our server and hes great! Only weird thing is $5 cranberry juice but otherwise everything is priced well. Try it though for sure.. Lamb biryani is great!!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant near North York. The curries and naan are delicious. They are a bit slow in their service but then who cares if the food is good. Goat meat curries are the best. Little pricey but good enough to satisfy our cravings."}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful dinner here.  First of all
the restaurant is absolutely beautiful and classy. Service was impeccable. We enjoyed the tandoori whole sea bream, eggplant in a wonderful curry, rice and naan. If you expect typical Indian fare offered at many places you will be disappointed.  They take everything up several notches with many unique offerings.  Everything was delicious.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It is a very chic resturant with good authetic indian food. They have a good customer service and if you aren't familiar with indian food like me, they will help you to find a food you like. I had sag gust with ruty which was very good. Make sure to ask for non spicy food, if you can't eat spicy food, my friend didn't ask and his food was a little too spicy."}
{"text":"I believe this place opened up recently, it was also an Indian restaurant before. The place is not very noticeable even when you drive by on Hwy 7. The parking entrance is actually behind Hwy 7, it is quite hard to notice it.

The ambience of the place is quite nice, it is very bright inside, plus the decor is very modern with a glass surrounded kitchen. The place was very quiet on the Monday. The decor and ambience makes the place \"bright romantic,\" maybe it's a personal thing, romantic doesn't mean low lighting.  It is also suitable for larger groups, they have circle tables and would be great for group event. 

The wine list has some common selections, most of them you can find at the lcbo; it is like a everyday wine list. However, the price of the wines are quite steep; i know restaurants make their money mostly from the drink. For example, a bottle of a German Riesling, Relax, usually costs $15 at LCBO, and they charged 60, a little steep? 

I have to say the food was quite nice. We ordered the tandoori lamb chops, and a curry dish. The lamb chops was packed with flavours, and moist. The lamb chops were fully cooked, I am not sure how Indian usually eat their lamb. I was actually  wondering if the waiter forgot to ask about the meat temperature when we order. The chicken curry dish was nice, especially the curry itself, the chicken was a little dry. Overall, the curry was great with naan bread. 

The service was generally good, however the waiter didn't give us a clear explanation of the dessert selection, as the dessert menu was not clear about each item."}
