{"text":"I got a pepperoni and hot pepper pizza tonight which is so delicious I'm still in shock. The owner of this establishment, John, is such a genuine, kind, community-minded guy, you feel great supporting him. He is truly salt of the earth. He comes from a family who has long been in the local restaurant business; his parents once owned the Shiloh Inn on Mt. Washington. I believe it is more casual now, but at the time it was an elegant, old school affair, in the best sense of the words. That's not why you should frequent BFG, though. The food is delicious and so affordable! My understanding is that the baklava at BFG is homemade by John's Greek mother, which is truly a gift. Name another pizza joint where you can get a dessert made with such tradition and TLC. Not only is the food great, but the prices are so low, I can only assume they're designed to support a high-volume business. So, please, help them to sell out every night! This neighborhood spot deserves all of your love. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great local pizza place! We decided to try something new and weren't disappointed. We ordered a Gyro Specialty pizza and a Steak Ranch pizza. Both were delicious and the Gyro had huge chunks of delicious meat on them. The price point is very reasonable. We also learned that two large pizzas for two people may be a bit too much and will last a while..."}
{"text":"What a great surprise to discover on Penn Avenue!  The pizza is easily as good a Mineo's or Aiello's, if not better -- the ambiance and seating is definitely better than those places. Everyone is so friendly and accommodating and all the food is absolutely delicious (and beyond affordable). I now stop by at least once for lunch and a couple nights on the way home for dinner. Pizza, gyros (best in the city), and dogs (amazing). The cheesecake is very fresh, homemade and fantastic, if you manage to get a slice, as they do sell out of it quickly on most days."}
{"text":"Amazing! Gyros are enormous. Loaded with me and fresh veggies. Yummmm!!!! And it only cost 5 bucks. This is definitely the best gyro in town."}
{"text":"Highly recommended!!! Gyros are unbelievable and for the price you can't beat it. Definitely will be back frequently. The owner is the man, go check him out"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place doesn't get more business. The prices are dirt cheap and the quality of the food is very good. The classic gyro is highly recommended. The flavors were bright and vibrant and the serving size was ample. I'm certain that BFG will become a favorite as more people find it. It's not a place for a romantic dinner, by any stretch of the imagination, but it makes a fantastic lunch. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This is an East End secret. Great pizza, perhaps the best gyro in the Burgh, and John the owner is awesome. A good man, he lives right in Garfield and is an old school neighborhood cat. We get our food here regularly, and you just can't beat the price and quality. I mean, 2 pizzas and 4.5 toppings for $20? And great service? GO HERE."}
{"text":"New in town.  Saw this place on Google Maps...  now, when I see 'BFG', I instantly think of Doom II (which has absolutely nothing to do with this place, but it caught my eye).  When I saw that they had gyros, I had to check it out.  I ordered a cheeseburger and a classic gyro*.  Both were good, and the gyro had a generous amount of meat compared to other places I've tried in the are so far.  In short:  good food, great prices.  The man who served me, who may have been the owner (I was too hungry to be chatty), seemed a very pleasant individual.  Seating was ample, atmosphere was comfortable, and they offered me water, which I did want but forgot to ask for.  No complaints.  I highly recommend eating here.  I will be back to try the pizza, and of course have more gyros.  *Note - a cheeseburger AND a gyro would probably be too much food for most people at a single sitting.  The portions are not small, I just have the capacity to eat a lot."}
{"text":"My first time here and I was extremely happy with the decision. It was a little gem I didn't know existed. Ordered a gyro and had a slice of plain pizza. The gyro was absolutely delicious. The service was phenomenal too. The prices we perfect; about $5 for gyro and $6 for 12\" pizza.  Oh and the jazz music in the background was just the icing on the cake. They'll be getting my business a lot more now."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of about twenty people for lunch on a weekend. There kitchen is in the back, and you can see everything they're doing, which is pretty cool. The area by the door is more for carry out; there's a couple tables. Inside, though, there's a lot more seating. The restaurant area is roomy and, although it's not fancy, it's homey. The owner and employees also really contribute to this feel. I got the impression that the owner knew everyone who walked in, and customers made it a point to say goodbye to everyone working there on their way out. There was also a mix-up in our group about when we would eat, but the owner was extremely patient and accommodating.  We only ordered pizza, so I can't speak for the Greek items on the menu that they're named for (Big Fat Greek). I did hear they have good gyros, though, and their prices seem pretty low for everything.  I watched them roll out preportioned bags of pizza dough and add sauce, cheese, and toppings. The pizza was served hot and delicious. Their pizza sauce has no sweet taste like others I've tried in the area. The pizza overall was good, but not particularly spectacular. I did really enjoy the crust, though--it was crispy on the outside (including the part under the sauce and cheese, which is often soggy) and soft (almost too soft and doughy) inside.  Although this place is a little out of my way, if I'm ever in the area, I'll definitely try other items from their menu."}
{"text":"BFG is kind of on an unassuming corner on Penn Ave in Garfield.  Food was great and the staff was really friendly.  I had the most delicious Greek salad I've found in Pittsburgh for the right price.  Everything was fresh unlike some experiences with other Greek diner places around Pittsburgh. Also the interior is really cool and cavernous.  \"}
{"text":"This place is great and the owner is so nice. I have ate at this place so many times so I felt I should finally write a review. I have had most things on the menu with my favorite being the Grilled Chicken Salad. The homemade Italian dressing is amazing. I have not had anything bad. Definitely recommend checking this place out. Plus the prices are very nice."}
{"text":"I love love love the salads from here! They have a wide range of food to order from: hoagies, gyros, salads, pizza, fries & more(they also have a vegan menu)!!! Very nice & welcoming staff!"}
{"text":"The gyro is absolutely amazing! However, the burgers are just plain awful. If you stick ti gyros at this place you will be good"}
{"text":"Great place. Average food but you can't beat the price, variety, people, or atmosphere. I live less than a block away and it's definitely a staple of the neighborhood. You get more than you pay for and I think this adds value to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Amazing food, huge dining area. Had the classic gyro and a side of falafel that was very good. If you still have the room get a slice of cheesecake.  Your stomach and taste buds will thank you for it."}
{"text":"Very reasonable prices on good food. Portions are very nice size so when ordering a large be prepared for leftovers. $1 slices of pizza are delicious and you will not have nicer service anywhere. I can't wait to try some of the new menu sandwiches!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a grilled chicken Greek salad to go.  The salad had a sh$t ton of melted cheese and fries on top.  So gross!  This is not a Greek salad.  I also asked for a side of Greek dressing or vinaigrette.  Got home to find out ranch was on the side.  I also ordered an order of hummus and pita bread the hummus looked hard and gritty.  I won't be back.  Not good!  Didn't even try the hummus it looked that unappetizing.  Straight to the trash w that hummus."}
{"text":"BFG is a great addition to the growing set of local businesses on Penn Ave between Garfield and Bloomfield.   It has tasty comfort food (pizza, hot dogs, gyros, subs, etc.) at rock bottom prices. A gyro with everything on it is $4.50. The meat, veggies, and bread were all very fresh. Pizza's run as low as $5 for a whole pie. Hot dogs are $2. The owner is friendly, and the restaurant itself is simple and clean. I wouldn't come here for a romantic dinner, but it is great for take out or a causal meal."}
{"text":"\"Falafel\" was mushy gelatinous mess.  Could not have been fried.  Consistency seemed more like it was microwaved.  Immediately discarded and ordered from Pasha.  Sad."}
{"text":"Finally, a place that accepts card payments! This place is great. I got a chicken gyro and it was delicious and reasonably priced! They have some really good burgers as well. The ingredients are fresh. This is one place I will be returning in the future."}
{"text":"A group of 10 of us were attending a training near here and checked it out for lunch. Wow! We were all impressed at the price, size and quality of the food, it was amazing! Not to mention the owner and staff were very friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The place is really spacious and the folks are really nice.  Pizza is decent but it's not Mineo's"}
{"text":"The food is all homemade and very affordable. Better hurry up and eat  here before he realizes how good the food is and raises his prices!"}
{"text":"Very expensive for the minuscule portion sizes. Dirty and unpleasant interior. My food was served in varying temperatures - one dish super hot and the other room temperature. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious stuffed grape leaves and really friendly service! The falafel sandwich was so big and stuffed with fresh chopped veggies. Sauces and hummus were tasty as well. Nice Rolling Stones painting :) A great deal, total for a lunch for two at under $15.00!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend. Not fancy, but genuine and affordable. Food was on point. We had gyros and fries. Our family (wife, myself, and 2 kids) ate for less than $15. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Advice for the owner: You need to change the look of the exterior of the building so that people actually know that a) you are a place of business that serves food, and b) you're open.  The confusing look of the building that I just mentioned is the reason it took me months of living near BFG to actually go in. It was the other positive reviews on Yelp that made me take the plunge. I am now officially a BFG junkie. Best Gyro's in Pittsburgh (sorry mike and tony's, but I'm over it), and the prices are obscenely low. Also, the employees and the owner are wonderfully nice. Give BFG a try, you'll be hooked"}
{"text":"Since I've been here several more times and tried several more items since my original review, I feel that an update is called for.  I may have been a bit too harsh in my original review, so I'll try to be more balanced and articulate this time.  There are several things that I like about BFG.  I like that it's an unpretentious community eatery that serves the neighborhood in which it's located, a fact that's reflected in the type of food that they serve, the price point, and the employees (yeah, that's right, I refuse to use the term \"help\") that they hire.  This contrasts with some other eateries along Penn Ave. in the vicinity, which draw a more yuppie East End crowd.  (Disclaimer: I'm an East End yuppie!)  BFG's commitment to the community is even reflected in the wall art, which is from local artists, as I mentioned before.  The owner and staff are very friendly, and are gracious hosts to a group that I attend that meets here on Mon. evenings.  On the other hand, I find the food to be rather hit-or-miss.  Some of it, such as the grape leaves and pita with tzatziki, the fries, and the baklava, is pretty decent.  Other items, such as the pizza (which I find too greasy for my liking) and the chicken gyro I mentioned in my previous review, leave room for improvement.  Given the price point, though, I can't complain too much, and since I return regularly, I'll figure out what I enjoy and will stick to ordering that.  As a side note, BFG was broken into the weekend before last, and is still struggling to deal with the repercussions of the break in (when I visited last night, the glass on the front door was still broken).  If you're in the neighborhood, consider stopping by to show some support!  3.5 stars for providing good hospitality and A-OK food on a consistent basis."}
{"text":"It's taken me a year to find out that the BFG cafe wasn't named after a weapon in Doom, and that it therefore wasn't some sort of internet cafe as I had expected. No, in fact, BFG cafe stands for Big Fat Greek cafe, presumably because if you eat here regularly you will be big and fat, and the fact that they serve gyros. Additionally, BFG stands for Bloomfield-Friendship-Garfield, the three nearest neighborhoods to the cafe(Well actually East Liberty is probably closer than Bloomfield but nobody wants to eat at the Enormous Large Fat Greek cafe, it's simply too verbose).  Walking in to the cafe is a big open kitchen, well over half the room, a few vending machines for drinks, and a seating area to the side. Seating is actually plentiful here as it appears the cafe is two spaces combined. The food here is my favorite kind: cheap. The most expensive item on their menu is a large speciality pizza for $13. 9\" hoagies and gyro sandwiches are $5 and under, fries are about a buck, and \"pittsburgh-style\" salads and 12\" pizzas are about $5-7. Simply put, they're hard prices to beat: a spinach-feta pizza and a gyro(big enough that I didn't even make it to the pizza) cost me $11 after tax.   The gyro was excellent, and though not enough to usurp my stomach's other Big Fat Greek champion(My Big Fat Greek Gyro), the price and convenience of this place easily makes up for it.  The pizza had a very thin crust and had a nice seasoning to it. Toppings weren't skimped on, but I had a little trouble finding the feta on the slice I did attempt. They also threw tomatoes on it for free, because the guy on the phone thinks they're a nice touch, and, I did too.  Shockingly, BFG didn't replace Salt as my favorite restaurant in this stretch of Penn ave, but for cheap sandwich while I'm working from home or for a pizza dinner when I don't feel like cooking, this is a great place to have in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Solid pizza and pretty inexpensive at that.  I order the spinach and feta with tomatoes on top when the mood strikes me.  Put on a movie and I'm all set for a night in. Yeah, I'm putting my phone on silent.  Smaller menu selection but I usually only order a few things anyway.  Oh, get their moussaka.  You can thank me later."}
{"text":"I was told to try this by many people, and finally did! I did not regret it. We ordered the chicken salad, and the steak gyro. The food was amazing, the portions were huge, and the price was extremely reasonable. We ordered ahead over the phone, and the time they estimated was almost exactly how long it took for it to be ready. The service was great, and the staff was friendly.   We only ordered out, but there was a dine in area as well. There Greek menu included many great options, and they had limited dessert options as well! We also ordered the chocolate cheesecake, which was delicious as well.   The locality of the restaurant also made me love it. The design was simple, and they had many posters of local events posted on the windows! I will be back in the near future to try more of their food!"}
{"text":"The owner is the nicest human alive and prices are so affordable. Delicious falafel and generous vegetarian options. Doesn't look super approachable from the outside, but you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered the Vegetarian mousaka & hummus and pita to go. Decent price, busy place! Mousaka was kind of mushy.. not sure if that's how it's supposed to be. Hummus and pita had no taste, kind of disappointing. Willing to stop back for a salad or gyro, which look appetizing from the pics from other yelpers."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure that my order was forgotten somehow because it took longer than everyone else's, but other than that it was a good experience. I got a gyro and cheese fries which were delicious! I got a small fry which really wasn't small. The meal was quite filling. I do wish there was a/c because it was a really muggy day. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The people are so nice here! I was craving a gyro and it was pretty delicious and a great price. Will come here more often for lunch. I hear the pizza is really good too. May need to try that soon...Glad Garfield has a place like this!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest, a lot of people haven't gone here. But they seriously should. The prices are great, but the food is better than its low price suggests.   Great vegetarian options and great pizza, and the service is fast and surprisingly attentive for how big a place it is.   Make this place a stop you go for lunch or dinner, order more than you can finish and be happy that it didn't break the bank. An easy 5 stars."}
{"text":"super inexpensive & fast service! Great place for lunch! I normally always get the grilled chicken salad with their homemade Italian! Delicious!"}
{"text":"While my daughter was in Children's Home, the nurses recommended coming across the street to try the food at Big Fat Greek (BFG) Café. The environment is very pleasant and welcoming, you can see them at work cooking behind the counters, and the owner, John, is actually from Greece and he's really very nice! Their gyros are the best I've ever had in my life, they're stuffed so full that they're huge, I can't believe that they're only $5! The homemade tzatziki is definitely out of this world! The prices there are very affordable, and the food is absolutely phenomenal! Was so excited to bring my fiancé here for my second visit and found out that he loved it a lot too! My fiancé and I will definitely be coming here again! :)"}
{"text":"BFG cafe is one of my favorite lunch spots in the city.  The gyros are some of the best I've had in the city, and I love their hamburgers.  Prices are great, and the staff is excellent.  John, the owner, is a great guy and has really gone out of his way to make the restaurant a staple of the community and accessible and affordable to everyone.  There's no AC, so it can get a little hot in the summer.  But the food is can't miss, and it's one of the remaining hole in the wall gems in the city."}
{"text":"Excellent food I don't know how it can be this cheap and be this good but it is.  I was looking for something inexpensive to eat lunch during the week and boy did I luck out!  They're hoagies are excellent their gyros are real and amazing!! And the pizza is fantastic"}
{"text":"Oh this is the best gyros I've had since that place in Chicago. Portion, price everything just amazing."}
{"text":"While waiting for the monthly Garfield 'art' walk to commence, we were walking around the general area, and saw the handful of up-priced bistroids near the Pittsburgh Glass Center, and decided to keep walking. We then came across the hipster painted facade of BFG Cafe, and jokingly thought 'Hmmmm...what does BFG stand for? Big F***ing Glutton'? That could be cool. So we crossed the street to check out the menu posted on the window, and discovered it was kind of a general pizza and burger joint, but with a Greek edge. Since we weren't looking to mortgage anything for a meal, we decided to give BFG a try.   We walked into what kind of looked like a giant sectional unfinished space, and approached the man with the Prince Valiant haircut at the counter to place our orders. One gyro, one burger with a side of hummous and pita, and one vegetarian combo, not to be confused with the vegetarian platter. Mine was the vegetarian, even though I'm not a vegetarian by any stretch of the imagination. The combo was felafel, grape leaves, hummous and tsaziki (cucumber salad) and pita. It had been eons since I'd had felafel, and really had a taste for it.  After the order was placed, the owner, Prince Valiant, whose name was really John, said we could sit anywhere inside, and he'd bring our food to us. It wouldn't be hard to find us, since we were the only people there.  The space was three large rooms, and John was still in the process of 'decorating' the space, with art from local artists adorning the walls.  The beverages were sold from a machine in the main entrance room, Coke products, yay.  After we'd been seated, John came in and asked me if I'd wanted the 'combo' or the 'platter', and I said 'combo' and he told me he'd been confused, and had to adjust my credit card since he'd charged me for the platter. He was incredibly nice and came back with the receipt of the difference credited to my card. Then he told me that due to a large catering order earlier in the day, he was out of the felafel, since they needed a day in advance to prepare it, making everything from scratch by hand. He offered some moussaka, which I've never been fond of, and was happy to replace the felafel with gyro meat. Since I'd not gotten a soda from the vending machine, he also brought a pitcher of water to the table.  The food came, and I do have to say...inexpensive, accommodating, and YUM. You could tell that, except for the pita, everything was made from scratch, full of flavor, good portions and quite satisfying. The grape leaves were very tasty, warm, with the right hint of dill, the hummous had a roasted pepper flavor, the tsaziki was creamy, cool and fresh, and the gyro meat was good quality meat. I've had gyro meat that was quite simply lamb spam on a pole, greasy and over-processed, and I've had gyro meat that was juicy and flavorful and 'meaty'. This was the good version.  John was quite enjoyably chatty and friendly, helpful and hospitable, with lots of info about his experiences in the restaurant and bar biz, his family's restaurant history in da burgh, the neighborhood and its ups and downs, and the art he had hanging in the space. By the end of our experience, John seemed more like a friend and a community man than just a business owner.   And he also shared, as another reviewer has already pointed out, the meaning of 'BFG', which has a duality, 'Big Fat Greek' and 'Bloomfield-Friendship-Garfield'.   Well, as a guy sold on the quality of his food, I can still stand by my original joke comment of 'Big F***ing Glutton'. The atmosphere may not be fit for a 'foodie', but the FOOD is definitely fit for someone who likes to eat. And the prices are really incredibly affordable. And quite frankly, he's just a great guy business owner who deserves support for creating something pleasant and NOT the least bit pretentious in a neighborhood with the drooling wolves of development dripping venom down the necks of anyone without the budget to join in their exclusive club.  Kudos my friend!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. My parents and I dropped in, got a few gyros and fries. The food is quite inexpensive but good quality. The falafel was tasty and cooked nicely. Fries were almost too big of a portion.  The inside is pretty nice, and kind of reminds me of some unassuming Mexican restaurants down in Austin - warm colors, bright artwork, stucco-feeling. Unfortunately, it was like 90 degrees and the place surprisingly doesn't have air conditioning, so we took our food to go. I'd like to come back on a cooler day to actually dine in sometime!  I'm surprised how early they close at night - it may be unlikely that I'm ever able to get dinner here. It'd be nice to have an alternative to Spak for when they are so busy they aren't even picking up their phones."}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate here last spring and it was really good. My daughter had a pizza and she was a real fan. I had the gyro and while not the best I ever had, was very good. Fries were hot and crispy. Baklava good and fresh. Decent prices too."}
{"text":"My partner and I love BFG and go there all the time. Their food is all homemade, and it tastes that way. They recently added a buffalo chicken sandwich to their menu, which is delicious, and Greek favorites like their vegetarian Moussaka are legit. Our favorite of their pizzas is the plain cheese. It's simple, straightforward, and very tasty. The owner also does a lot of community outreach, so you can feel warm and fuzzy about supporting a great local business."}
{"text":"The gyro is my go to. It's the best I've had in Pittsburgh so far. The dolmas are ok. Pita is good. Salad is regular pizza shop iceburg. Baclava is great! The buffalo chicken pizza is my favorite Always kind, quick service and great prices!"}
{"text":"Great food,  great price,  very friendly and accomidating staff.  We had some special requests due to my son's health problem and they made his food exactly as we asked and were very willing to help."}
{"text":"Just got done with my experimental hybrid of BFG's eggplant parmesan hoagie and original gyro, which became a gyro with fried eggplant and sauteed spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, and onions...with a cucumber dressing. Whew! It was pretty hefty, and although I thought the price would have stayed at $4.50 (the price of either the gyro or the eggplant parm hoagie), it ended up being $5.50, which I guess is fair, because I am a pain in the woo. Plus, a vendor had recently dropped off some experimental chocolate baklava (what a day!), of which I got to try a piece. So, that gyro: hefty, yes - delicious, yes - signs of frying life (oil!) all over my hands and napkins, yes - memorable, sure, I dunno. What most stuck out to me was the service, really - everyone there, including the owner, is thoughtful, sweet, and down-to-earth. Definitely a good place to grab lunch!"}
