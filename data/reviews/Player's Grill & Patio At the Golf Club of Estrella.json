{"text":"After coming to this place over and over again we have realized that we come for the food not for the service.   The service is normally slow and not very attentive,  and more often than not there is a problem with the food.  However, they do fix the problem without a smile on their face and no apology.  Why do we continue going?  It is very close to our home and we accept the place for what it is. When they do do it right it is very good."}
{"text":"The food here is great and so is the outside atmosphere the staff is always friendly one of the nicest places to have a relaxing dinner they also have a appetizer nachos the best ever"}
{"text":"Amazing experience, beautiful patio, great service. The food is to die for, atmosphere is amazing especially at sunset. Try the key lime pie. One of my best restaurant experiences ever. Decent price too."}
{"text":"Brad the manager is always very accommodating even when we do not have dinner reservations and we are very hungry after 18 holes of golf  the staff, especially Heather is extremely pleasant - each time we visit we fell like we are part of a Estrella golf family. Thank You: Matt and Jo"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! The food was absolutely incredible. Brad took great care of customers and Danielle was outstanding!!! What a great night! Thanks so much! Definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed dinner here on a warm Friday evening. The sunset was beautiful and the misters made it bearable.  The Hubby had one of the nights specials, catfish. He loved it. I ordered the beef medallions and I honestly will not order anything different  in the future. It was very tender and flavorful, better than any steak house on this side of the valley. The gratin potatoes were perfection and the vegetable medley seasoned and cooked nicely.  I absolutely recommend this dining establishment with out pause. Go, call for a reservation right now."}
{"text":"This was my favorite place to eat because of the amazing ambience outside under the trees. Good food. Decent service. The decision to cut down all the palo verde trees and replace them with tall umbrellas destroyed it for me."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place to go for happy hour during the week. Indoor and outdoor dining. The house made chips are awesome as well as the brisket tacos and chicken strips. They usually have one special for dinner during the week, but more formal dining options on the weekend. The beer selection is horrible.   Over the past couple months it has really changed, service has taken a dive and when you go in there and are waiting for a table they intentionally avoid eye contact because they are busy. They genuinely are busy, but without an actual hostess and additional seating, it just is no longer worth the time and effort for how they treat the customer.   They also allow people to smoke on the patio area, just outside the doors. There is a no smoking sign stating the law right on the door itself.   Great food, crummy beer selection and horrible service."}
{"text":"Overall I am a fan of this place although there are some definite pros as well as cons.  I'll start with the cons.  The breakfast is lousy.  My father in law ordered a Texas Cinnamon bun and it is literally the type that you get from a vending machine package.  I had a breakfast sandwich and that was nothing to write home about either.  However, they do offer an excellent happy hour.  When the weather is cooler, be sure to sit outdoors and enjoy the beauty of the surrounding golf course.  The food they serve at happy hour as well as the lunch menu is good.  My husband recommends the BLTA with avocado.  I had a Tuna scooper salad and that was good as well.  Dinner is only offered on weekends and the menu is small, however it is very good. I recommend the ahi tuna."}
{"text":"Morning! My name is Julie and I'm a server at the Players Grill at Estrella Mountain golf course and I'm writing in response to a very nice review from Lauren here on yelp! Thank you so much for your kind words but most important it's so wonderful to know that you and your family have found a great place to be comfortable and enjoy a wonderful dining experience!I thoroughly enjoy waiting on you and your family when every you stop in... it brightens my day! I'm so glad the Players Grill is able to do the same for you! I look forward to seeing you soon...in the meantime enjoy this beautiful Arizona fall! Maybe a trip during happy hour so you could really enjoy it out on our deck hint hint thanks again Julie"}
{"text":"Great place for some drinks and food. The Chef Chris is incredible. Whether you are there for a full meal or not, I think you will not be disappointed.   Be prepared to sit out doors as the seating area inside is limited."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch, sit outside and enjoy the view even if you're not golfing. The staff is extremely nice and accommodating. The food is extremely good, our favorite is the BLTA Bacon Lettuce Tomato Avocado."}
{"text":"Gorgeous views, excellent food (especially the chicken nachos and beef dishes), poor service.....A recent happy hour excursion found the patio very crowded. No big deal, we would get a drink and relax on the benches outside the pro shop. First drink was not made with requested alcohol so it was grudgingly remade. Then the other drink was made with well gin, menu stated it was $3. When I was charged $6.50 for it, I questioned the charge and my change was slammed down on the counter with a retort that this was my change. I was embarrassed for the server and the customers who witnessed this treatment. I realize the club has become popular but perhaps they need to add more staff so the employees are not so frustrated that they treat customers so shoddy?!! Not sure we can recommend this place since this was the 2nd time in a week we had poor service. Hoping for change, as we love the food and views. Young girls seating people are sweet, wait staff just needs help!!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband LOVE this place. We are residents in Estrella and have lived here for about 2 years now and never came here until just recently. I wish I would've found this place sooner. We love to come here for any meal! Breakfast, lunch, and dinner is awesome! Not only is the food on point, but ambiance outside on the patio is so nice, and the people who work here are phenomenal. Julie is our absolute favorite. From the first day we came she was so kind and welcoming and personable. She already knew our names by the second time we came in. We absolutely love it here and we love being able to take our family as well sometimes. We are definitely going to be regulars for life"}
{"text":"I love the location I have eaten there several times but it has become increasingly frustrating to make a reservation as they fill up quickly. A reservation is a must. Then they are only open for dinner on Friday and Saturday.  For lunch it is nothing special at all just an average hamburger etc."}
{"text":"Played the course and stopped in for lunch, and I was pleasantly surprised. The food was better than I had expected, service was too. Prices were average for a golf course caf√©. Nice outdoor seating area too with great views. The chicken nachos I will order again. Check them out if you're up the hill, or take a drive for dinner and you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Wish the restaurant was like Verrado because we certainly live in a beautiful setting to do the same exact thing. Floor to ceiling windows overlooking the golf course, HUGE dining area with bar and array of different kinds of food to choose from. Everything else is perfect for the exception of the interior eating~ the patio is nice too but they really skimped on the restaurant itself. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Our first time here. Two of us went in for an early dinner because we were starving. We didn't have to wait for a table but it was weird walking in without a hostess to greet you. We just stood there until a waitress told us to seat ourselves. It was happy hour so the menu was limited but we were told we could also order sandwiches, burgers and brats from the kitchen in addition to the happy hour menu. We stuck with the menu and ordered calamari, wings, and bruschetta. Our sodas took awhile to be ordered but refills took the usual amount of time. They came in foam containers like you get at fast food restaurants which I thought was odd but whatever.  The food was good. It was apparent that everything was freshly cooked and prepared.  Even for happy hour I thought the prices were a bit too much, especially the bruschetta. There were two pieces, enough for two servings but you still felt a bit wanting at the end. The wings were boneless and were actually more like pretty small thighs. They were good but we only got four.  Then came the best thing ever: their chocolate cake. It's the 3rd best chocolate cake I've ever had. We could tell it was made in house and by someone who knew what they were about. It was chocolately but not overly sweet; the cake was moist but held together very well. The frosting was perfectly thick and perfectly sweet. With two small dollops of whip cream it was a perfect shared dessert. It's actually a good size so I wouldn't recommend eating it all yourself! Mm, scrumptious. I told the waitress that we liked the food but we'll be back for the cake. If we hadn't tried the cake then I would have given this place an average 3 stars.   Service wise, everyone was friendly but busy. The patio was very nice and of course you have interesting views. I think in the summer it might not be tolerable but we'll see. I think some of the tables were the white plastic kind you can rent out from caterers and that looked a little tacky to me. The other half of the tables were the metal and iron kind with cushions.   There was a family with a child there but I don't know if they have a children's menu."}
{"text":"Great patio with gorgeous sunsets. This Chef always creates great dinners. We've never enjoyed anything less than mouth watering. Good staff lead by a Manager who gets it. And they now offer a happy hour Sun-Thurs 4-7pm."}
{"text":"We love this grill for a lunch of a chicken wrap. Also had a fun luncheon Birthday party on the patio overlooking the course. My family was a part of this course and grill up to 15 years ago and we really like the staff!"}
{"text":"Live up the road at CantaMia, go to the club periodically for lunch and an occasional dinner. Brad and crew make you feel welcome and you realize this is a special place. Menus are limited but quality is good either lunch or weekend dinner.  In the warm season, the patio is the place to be otherwise inside is small but comfortable. Nothing pretentious or fancy, just very good ambience, food and service. Ted S"}
{"text":"It's nice that Estrella Mountain Ranch actually has a place where it's residents can eat out without having to drive 30 minutes or so. The view, mountains and the beautiful bright green golf course make for a pleasant setting.   The wings we ordered were average, and there were only two choices of flavor. They were supposedly a happy hour item, though it hardly felt that way. The service wasn't noticeably great, but the one server there did seem to be very busy, so it really was a non-issue.   I contacted the management in regards to setting up safe and sober rides home for their patrons, since they do serve alcohol, and taxis are nonexistent in EMR, and it would seem they're blowing me off about it, so that doesn't really sit well.   I'm willing to give it another go though, maybe on a night wherein it's advertised that they have a renowned chef focus on a specific dish for it's customers. More to come..."}
{"text":"Closing at 4 on Superbowl Sunday, With Golfers Still on course....No signage on glass doors w hours for \"restaurant\" or Golf shop!   Needs Total re-do and new management to bring in Customers!  3 mo from my home, but I'd rather drive to Verrado....stupid    5 stars!!?? Absolutely not!  Those ppl must know the management or something.  We've been at least 7 times in last 3 yrs.....never over 3 stars"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised and now eat there regularly. Good breakfast and lunch.  Very good happy hour with good drinks and appetizers. During the week they only offer an extended Happy Hour till 7:00 that is above average bar food but on Friday & Saturday the chef has an excellent menu. Kitchen is very small so it's a limited menu but excellent preparation. The seasoning and sauces are terrific and creative. Open to the public but Friday is crowded with local residents. Saturday is generally quieter.  Prepare to eat out on the expansive patio with views, fire pits and heaters for cooler weather and misters for summer. Indoor dining is only a few tables, more of a coffee shop.  Portions are adequate but the smaller sizes have commensurately lower prices. From NYC to Scottsdale to LA this competes. Only drawback is the wine selection...limited and pedantic. Otherwise it would be a 5 on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! This place is legit...especially on a Friday or Saturday night. Whoever is the chef, he could compete against Bobby Flay! We took friends visiting from southern California and they were equally impressed. The wife thought her beef tenderloin was the best she had every eaten. My husbands salmon was cooked perfectly, and the Chicken Scallopine was outstanding.  Service was fantastic, prices are a bit high, but worth every dime spent. Fresh crisp mixed salad, warm pita and hummus appetizer, evening specials, good wine selection. We ate inside because of the heat, but we return and eat on the beautiful patio soon. I would highly recommend this place for the quality of food and service. My new favorite \"Date Night\" restaurant!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here for lunch and Friday night dinners, and it was great!  Went there for breakfast this morning and while the choices were limited, it was just ok.   I had the breakfast burrito....large and good, but I don't see myself going back for breakfast!  Lunch and dinner... Yes,  I'll be back!  That's the reason for the 4 stars!"}
{"text":"I cannot begin to explain what a wonderful experience my family and I have each time we go to the Player's Grill in Estrella. The staff is so warm and welcoming. The patio seating and view is incredible. Friday and Saturday nights they serve full entree dinner. The roasted salmon, stuffed pork, and basically everything else is absolutely outstanding! Undoubtedly the best eats in Estrella."}
{"text":"It's everything you would want. Great service, cold beer and chips and salsa to die for. OMG!!! They are so good."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place because we need it here!  But the outside tables don't get washed down and they are sticky and attract flies; the inside accommodations are soo small, the bags of chips are stale and outdated...please be a great provider of food services for Estrella! Please expand your dining."}
{"text":"Wow. That is the easiest way to sum up the Players Grill and Patio.   I went here based off of a friends' recommendation, and I'm so glad I did! The food, service, and location were all amazing.   The restaurant is part of the Golf Club of Estrella, overlooking the beautiful, green golf course, and the mountains on all sides. Their patio is perfect for watching the sunset! We came on a Saturday afternoon for happy hour (3-5pm) and then dinner. They've got a nice selection of drinks, including a full bar, and the patio is just so lovely for happy hour!  For dinner, we ordered the beef medallions (amazing), the salmon (also amazing), and the double bacon cheeseburger (you guessed it - amazing). Of course, with this much good looking food around, there was a fair bit of sharing and sampling happening. I ordered the beef medallions, which come with a side of vegetables and scalloped potatoes, served in a Cabernet sauce. So good! The sauce goes so well with all elements of the meal.  The salmon was cooked to perfection, and the pico de galo on top was a great touch!  And lastly, the burger. I know it may seem like an easy dish to make, but a truly delicious burger is no small feat. The French fries were perfect (my favorite - beer battered) and the burger was hot, juicy, and tender. So good!  The staff was super friendly and attentive. They offer a nice variety of food and drinks, and in such a beautiful, intimate location! I highly recommend! Great for any crowd - friends, families, or dates."}
