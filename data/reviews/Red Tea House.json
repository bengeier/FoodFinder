{"text":"Best egg rolls in the burg by far. I would definitely go back. This will be my go to for take home."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi in the south hills. Shrimp tempura roll. Yummy.  Tried the volcano roll as well outstanding."}
{"text":"I've finally found duck I like!!  The Peking duck at Red Tea House is excellent.  Not at all greasy. Very well done.  Their maki rolls are wonderful, the Philadelphia roll, and the shrimp tempura roll being my favorites.  I go to this restaurant every couple months and it has become one of the go to meet up places for friends.  The service is always great, and the I have never had a bad meal.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great food; I usually order the chicken lomain or garlic chicken(with no canned vegetables). Great food, friendly owners and staff. Prompt delivery. Their chicken velvet corn soup and scallion pancakes are delicious as well."}
{"text":"The Red Tea house is a phenomenal establishment! Every Friday after school, about 15 of my friends go there to savor the warm nature of this Chinese restaurant.  The food is obviously delicious, especially the egg rolls, steamed and fried rice, wonton soup, sweet and sour chicken, and General Tso's chicken.  The manager, Chen, always welcomes us in open arms; I truly feel at home there with the family environment that the staff provides.  Check it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and their wonton soup is to die for. Wish they offered crab Rangoon though. Highly recommended to try this place at least once."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends after a lovely Sunday afternoon of giving my credit cards a work out at the mall. I was teased by fresh hot tea and some lovely steamed dumplings as starters. We ordered the shredded beef, onion chicken and black pepper chicken. We also got a plate of the Hawaiian fried rice. Chinese food can often be greasy but these dishes took some serious liberties with oil. Flavor of everything was minimal and the sticky rice was dry. The black pepper chicken would rank as the best of the worst.  I can honestly sum up my experience there in one word - bland. I am not sure if this is typical fare or if it was an off day. It was dissatisfying and quite disappointing."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service.  You can even \"BYOB\" if you wish."}
{"text":"Best chinese food my fiance and I have ever eaten. Egg rolls were crispy and delicious, and the general tso's makes other asian restaurants pale in comparison. Each piece was real white meat chicken with some flavorful coating (unlike other places where there is a tiny amount of meat and it's dark meat). The fried rice was very fresh and flavorful as well. Although the outside looks a little sketchy, it's very nice inside, and the prices match that of any other place. I think our general tso's plates (which contained so much food it was like two meals in one) were about $7-8. Also, the sushi was phenomenal (they also draw little designs on the plate if you're into that lol). We made this our \"go-to\" place after one visit."}
{"text":"Ordered amazing chicken had to see if it was amazing and it was truly.  Also had pork with Portobello mushroom,very good.  The best shrimp roll alive."}
{"text":"This place was excellent with the sushi. Try the pink lady, it is a very great variety with a great buttery taste. This is another level a sushi. Also if you like a very quiet place to talk or to just be by yourself, this is perfect. The workers there a nice is well."}
{"text":"They had some good sushi. ordered the following and they tasted goos....Rainbow roll, spicy tuna roll and red dragon roll. Their egg roll is really good as well. The chinese dishes - orange chicken, portabella mushroom with garlic sauce and veg fried rice was yummy!"}
{"text":"Okay first of all this used to be szechwan (spelling?) house and looked something akin to old country buffet on the inside. The renovations are awesome and the restaurant is now quaint and up to date. However, the seating is cramped and the atmosphere is now awkward because you can pick lice out of the child's hair at the  neighboring table.   My wonton soup was bland, my egg roll was made of old shrimp and dad's raw meat, and my sushi was mealy and room-temperature. I didn't even use the full value of my groupon and I honestly don't care. I will never make it a point to visit red tea house again."}
{"text":"Not very good at all.  Staff was courteous at first, but waitress got frustrated when my Japanese wife could not understand her accent.  I ordered orange chicken, and it was abysmal.  The batter was not cooked the whole way, making it gummy and starchy.  The sauce tasted only of soy sauce!  There were charred peppers and orange rind in the sauce, which lent not flavor at all.  No ginger, no garlic, nothing.  My wife ordered cashew chicken, which also was very bland.  We will not go back here."}
{"text":"Yuuuge (huge) portions! Great nice service and clean. Food ok but if not terribly picky it's a good deal."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Everything I've ordered is great and they are so friendly. Chinese is delish and sushi is amazing!!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, they do American Chinese food well, wish it weren't so greasy though! The service is nice, no one rushes you, and the restaurant itself is a nice space but the food is just okay."}
{"text":"Even though I live in columbus, I like to return to my hometown, Pittsburgh.  I subscribe to groupon offers and saw this particular restaurant offered crispy fried beef which up to now I have only been able to get at City Lights in Washington DC.  So it was an easy decision to get the groupon.  We had a fabulous meal here.  The crispy fried beef was better than what I have in DC.  Hubby ordered the special General Tso's that had chicken and shrimp.  Lots of food, tasty accompanied by some kind of chips and hot tea.  The service was attentive, perhaps overly so, but then again our waiter clearly wanted to please.  We often go to San Francisco for our chinese so I am comparing it with some top rated places.  I loved this place and can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I ordered the hk style curry chicken and was very disappointed. It was very bland and the chicken was not fresh. Had a odd taste to it that was not very appetizing. Portions were decent and price was very cheap. You get what you pay for I guess. I've lived in the area for a decade and only tried it recently. What a disappointment. How did they stay open for so long??"}
{"text":"I am a fan of this restaurant and visit it pretty often when we are rehearsing at OLOV up the hill.  The sushi is great and the portions are huge!  I usually order ginger chicken and broccoli - it's not on the menu but they are always happy to make it for me.  The service is amazing and fast!  I wish I could get take out from this restaurant but, alas, I live too far away.  I highly recommend Red Tea House."}
{"text":"Food is always good and the owners are friendly!  This is usually our go to spot when we are in the mood for Chinese."}
{"text":"I don't really like this place especially not when you compare it to other HK style cafes. Why? Because I usually order the egg sandwich and other places usually make their eggs scrambled, super fluffy with soft bread/toast and butter. This place... once they made my sandwich with probably half an egg - it barely filled the bread and it was pan fried ie. pour the egg on the pan and flip it once it starts browning. The second time I ordered it, it was a fried egg. It was the saddest soggy egg sandwich of life. Make up your mind on how you want your egg sandwich.  My mom comes here a lot and gets the pork vermicelli with preserved vegetables (I think) and she really likes it hence I endure their shitty egg sandwich for my mother's enjoyment."}
{"text":"The food is always consistent and very good. The only thing that is a down fall is they don't deliver until 5. But other than that food is great and staff is always pleasant."}
{"text":"This restaurant is typically good, but tonight they were fantastic, and super fast. My order arrived in about 35 min after ordering ! I ordered an avocado salad, salt and pepper chicken wings, wonton soup and green curry with shrimp. EVERYTHING was delicious, perfectly cooked and arrived piping hot. So hot we had to let things cool off a little before eating. Please note, it is 10 degrees outside tonight. Can't go wrong with this Resturant!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for - nothing fancy - inexpensive and tasty! English is not the most useful language at the Tea House but the staff are helpful and the take-out menus have English subtitles. :)"}
{"text":"Went here for sushi.. due to the holiday (Columbus day) they were out of a number of the fish pieces i really wanted...  but what they did have i liked which was tuna and white tuna ... the owner/manager was very nice and apologetic about not having some of the fish"}
{"text":"This is one of those place where the food was ok and the service was ok and I really have no complaint - but it is simply not memorable.  I had steamed dumplings and spicy chicken with vegetables.  It all came at the same time, which I do not like so the pacing of my meal was off.  That is important to me.  Lot of choices when I stay up here so I wont come back."}
{"text":"The Red Tea House beats the Sesame Inn hands down- it's the best Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The restaurant is located in a minimall at the end of Greentree Road.  The decor is outdated, but don't let these two things hold you back from visiting.  Upon entry we were greeted kindly at each visit.  The menu is expansive yet reasonably priced.  Shortly after we were seated, we got a hot pot of black tea and fried wonton strips for dipping in a sweet or spicy mustard sauce.  The tea was great, but at some visits it's a little stronger than others.  Because the portions are so large, we have taken to getting a sushi appetizer (always fresh and never fishy) and splitting a meal.  Although cliche, the General Tso's is always meaty, crispy and has the perfect amount of spice.  I have also had seafood, orange and seasame chicken and was never disappointed.  We were never charged a split plate charge.  Usually the bill only comes out to $25 for two people and we left stuffed.  Service is not super fast, so I wouldn't recommend going if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"I asked the people who worked next to this Chinese restaurant about the food. I was told that the restaurant was closed by the health department. I would not eat here since this business is operated by the same people who operated the business that was closed by the health department."}
{"text":"So my first review of this place a few weeks ago was not good . We wanted to try again just to make sure we still felt the same.   We did order different items on the menu but over all, we had a better experience. We ordered the general tso chicken and hunan crispy chicken. The food was well packed and hot this time. We also got hot and sour soup which was very good. The chicken was moist and decently flavorful. The portion was enough that I had enough for lunch the next day but my bf ate it all in one sitting. We got 1 big container of rice which i didn't like but we like each other enough to share. It wasn't the best we have had but it was pretty good. The favor of the Tso was not as sweet as like it l. I added some hot sauce to get to get it a lil more flavor.   I think this time was way better than the fist time. They even delivered to us as well. It took about an hour to get everything so we will prob pick it all up next time to save time.   Overall, I think we would come back to try other items because we thought we we ordered was pretty decent."}
{"text":"If you know typical Hong Kong style cafes, you'll know what to expect from Red Tea House. A bit of a hole-in-the-wall feel, super local, fast service, good food quantity, and cheapo prices. What they do well, they do really well. The item that I get, and crave, is their pork chop noodle breakfast special that comes with a drink. I usually get the HK-style milk tea. The hubs usually  gets his satay beef noodle soup and a second order of fried noodles.   They serve a plethora of other typical Hong Kong breakfast foods like pineapple buns with butter, combos that are variations of eggs, luncheon meat, ham, breakfast macaroni in soup, etc. They also serve a lot of Cantonese rice, noodle and entree dishes, which I've found to be OK.   I stick to what I love about this place and have pretty much always come out happy.  It's located in a strip plaza on Kennedy - pretty easy to miss if you're not looking for it. Free parking."}
{"text":"I love Red Tea House. My family and I have been frequenting here for years. The service is always friendly and quick. They introduced a sushi bar within the last few years that serves some of my favorite sushi in the city--looking at you, spicy salmon roll (with what I think are panko bread crumbs on the inside to give it a little crunch? SO good). Prices are just right. Highly recommended for a quiet dinner out or for takeout!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times with my family. I'm not about to give the place 1 star based on one dish lol. I do realize you get what you pay for, but the food is far from terrible. I certainly do not like the curry here because the taste is bland and not very authentic even for Chinese curry. I can say their \"mah po tofu\" is very well made, as is the braised beef brisket. The food/taste is definitely not top class, but definitely worthy of more than 1 star! :)"}
{"text":"Got fast delivery from here. We had the sushi which  was pretty good. However that was the only good thing we had. We also had the \"dumplings\" which was 90% dough with a bland pork filling. We also had general tsos tofu which I was happy to see on the menu because I enjoy tofu. However I was disappointed. There wasn't much flavor to it and it had the texture and chew as if it were beef jerky."}
{"text":"This place sucks, I've had it once and that's all I'll ever have it. It's over priced food court food. It was terrible,  if the apocalypse happened and I survived, and red tea house was the only food place ever, I'd eat my own arm. Even my fortune in the fortune cookie sucked. After me and my girlfriend ate the food, we both agreed we would rather have eaten a bacon Bleu burger from Wendy's and we don't eat fast food very often at all. I recommend this place to nobody!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey. Food was alright but nothing special."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese Resturant. All the food is made to order. My favorite is the pepper shrimp. The staff and service is so kind."}
{"text":"Great joint for a quick meal and super affordable. The breakfast lunch meals are approx $4-$9. I ordered the satay beef noodle with ramen- it was honestly too much to even finish for lunch. Also tried the fried steak with rice - sweet and sour flavour, that was good as well. Service is great but do not expect a clean environment."}
{"text":"Eh, I don't get all of the great reviews. My husband and I ordered delivery from Red Tea House on a friday night for dinner. He was fasting for Orthodox Christmas so he ordered Tofu in the general tso's sauce. I decided to try the beef in garlic sauce and we also had edamame. We both noted that the prices seemed a little steep but we were hoping it was because the food was amazing like the other reviewers noted. The delivery arrived by the time quoted and contained our entire order. First, we tried the edamame. We are both huge edamame fans and you can't really get edamame wrong, right? Wrong. Half the edamame wasn't completely cooked and was hard. Next, for my beef with garlic sauce, I was surprised that the beef was in strips. I'm talking like the width of shoe strings and although the menu description did not note vegetables, the container was full of onions and peppers. In fact, the dish was mostly veggies with a side of beef. I was also surprised by the level of spice in my dish. The menu does note that the dish is spicy but I usually ignore the spicy sign because I love spicy dishes and most dishes that say they are spicy I consider mild. Well they were not lying about being spicy. I could only eat about 10 bites before I had to stop because my mouth was on fire. Not complaining because again, I love the spicy but, important to note when ordering a spicy dish, they mean business. I also spent the extra dollar to get the fried rice. This was also a mistake as the rice was cooked with some soy sauce and egg. No veggies, no pork, no flavor. My husband did enjoy the general tso's sauce and thought it had a good balance of tang and sweet. If we go back, maybe next time we'll try the sushi."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place, nestled in the Virginia Manor shopping center...but I'm also really lazy on Sunday nights. The convenience of ordering delivery online through Yelp has just changed my life! How amazingly easy and convenient!  They send an email with the status of your order so you know it was placed, and I was pleasantly surprised when my food came even faster.   We ordered basic Chinese takeout items, 2 vegetable fried rices, chicken and broccoli, and vegetable steamed dumplings. Everything (including price) was exactly what you want from Chinese takeout! The portions were huge, easily having a couple lunches out of it. The chicken and broccoli was just perfect. Fried rice was tasty too! The dumplings were good, they weren't that hot but also I think I prefer egg rolls. Anyway, we will definitely be ordering (through Yelp!) again in the future!"}
{"text":"Awesome Chinese. Best staff. Happy family.  Seriously, it's so good. (My son dictated this and is feeling pretty strong about his 1st Yelp review!"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly.  My Dad says it the best shrimp egg foo young he's ever had. It's not on the menu, so you have to ask them to make it. I thought the food was decent."}
{"text":"An exceptional experience! Great food (and my family loves New York Chinese) and wonderful staff. We had three kids in our group, and every accommodation was made to ensure they were taken care of. Recommend the steamed dumplings, ginger chicken and beef with mixed vegetables."}
{"text":"I heard good things about this place. When I tried it today, I had very high hopes. I ordered the General Tso's Chicken and the steamed pork dumplings. The General Tso's was alright. Mediocre really. It was clear the chicken was hand cut, and not swimming in the chemical taste you get from other places, so I appreciated that. The dumplings, however, were not good. Whatever dough they use, they use way too much of it and it overpowers the pork inside. I wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"This place is cozy and definitely makes you feel at home! We came here late on a Friday night to grab dinner. Although it was a bit empty, the people that were there felt comfortable as if they were at home. As soon as you sit, they serve you with tea and some crunchies for you to snack on.   We ordered a hot and sour soup, half a duck, eggplant with chicken and a salmon roll for sushi. Our waitress messed up our order and gave us the salmon nigiri instead of the salmon maki. It wasn't a big deal but I preferred the maki. The food came out promptly after the sushi. I did enjoy the food but it wasn't anything that I was blown away by. The hot and sour soup was good especially with the crunchy wontons that they had given us at the beginning. The half duck was good too but I couldn't taste much of the sauce that it came with. Since we ordered a lot, we didn't finish most of it so we asked for the food to be packed to go."}
{"text":"Food was worthy, but no liquor license which I found strange.  The inside is clean and decor is so-so.  It was ok but not tremendous."}
{"text":"This place is consistently very clean inside and the food is always delicious. I used to have sushi delivered all the time until I moved to Crafton! Miss it! The owner is the nicest man and always makes sure to greet and check up on every patron. He Always pitches in wherever he is needed too! They always thoroughly care that all of your wants are met."}
{"text":"OMG! The Plum Duck was so rich and oh so good. I barely finished it the portion was so huge. The insides are really classy, and our server was efficient and adorable."}
{"text":"USA Roll is one of my favorite rolls of all time, anywhere. There was lots of fish and it was fresh and melt in your mouth quality.  This used to be our neighborhood Chinese place when it was Szechuan House. I saw the nice reviews for the changeover and we visited for lunch. The lunch deals are all cheaper than $10 with tax and tip. Also, it seems that green tea comes with it complimentary -- at least, we had some and we didn't order it.  It was our server's first day, but other staffers helped cover for her and we were well taken care of.  I ordered General Tso's chicken. It was spicy and flavorful, without being overly sweet. It tasted much, much better than the stuff at a lot of take out places and the mall. You can tell superior ingredients are used.   I look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Service is above & beyond! Best pad Thai I think I've ever had, I'm no expert but it was delicious  very quaint!"}
{"text":"Never knew this restaurant was here and I am so glad I found it on yelp. Very friendly service. Miso soup was very good. I also had the salmon roll and dragon roll."}
{"text":"We have dined in as well as picked up take out several times, and are always happy. We get take out at work from sever different local places at work, and this is the only place i will get chinese from. Restaurant is clean, very polite servers, reasonable prices. The biggest thing for me with chineese is the quality of meat , and they seem to have the best locally."}
{"text":"Pros: Prices are great Portions are even better  Cons: Appearance very old  Red Tea House is the old school of HK style cafes.  This place looks like it's been around forever. The decor and appearance could use some work, but this place is a solid place for some HK style fast food.  My wife actually stumbled upon this place because she actually thought it was a tea house from it's name.  Let's get this out of the way, if appearance means a lot to you, this is not the place for you.  This place is very no frills.  The floors here don't have a 5 second rule, if it touches the floor, forget about it.  Having said that, this place ticks off everything else you need in an HK style cafe.  They have tons of variety in their menu.  Speaking of that. their entire menu is on the walls of this place.  Most of the items have English on them though there are some specials that don't. Based on previous pictures, they do have a paper menu with English on it.  I was not able to see it while I was there.  We had a mixed grill rice and a baked chicken on spaghetti with an order of congee.  Food comes out pretty fast here.  What I really like about this place is the portions.  They are super for the price you pay here.  You will leave this place full, big eater or not.  The taste is pretty standard for what you will find at HK style cafes.  As with most HK style cafes, meals come with soup and a drink.  What stands out is that you can get a cold drink here with no extra charge.  There are very very few places that do that now.  Red Tea House will get the job done if you're craving some HK fast food.  It's no frills appearance might turn off some, but if you can get past that you can't go wrong coming here."}
{"text":"Just a regular sushi spot. The sushi was average, still good. Lots of options which was nice, but seemingly slightly overpriced compared to other sushi spots.   But the service was excellent. Very clean place.   Vegas roll was our favorite!"}
{"text":"I can't speak for the dine-in service, but after offering take out from the Red Tea House I don't desire to ever go again. I ordered take out a couple months ago after seeing how busy they always are and some good reviews here on Yelp. I ordered cheese wontons, sweet and sour chicken, and pork fried rice. My total was about $18.00 which I didn't think was too bad for the portion size. When picking up my order the restaurant was busy and the man cashing me out was very kind, so I was very excited to get home and eat, thinking this meal would be pretty great. Once I got home, I started off with the cheese wontons. To my unfortunate surprise, the cheese wontons had a stringy type of cheese when I pulled them apart. Anyone with a brain knows that cheese wontons certainly should not be filled with any sort of cheese that's stringy. They tasted awful. I threw the whole rest of the order away and decided to try my luck at the sweet and sour chicken and rice. The chicken was completely mushy and the vegetables were in massive chunks. I suppose ordering a crispy food for take out can have this effect but I was disappointed nonetheless. The fried rice however tasted just plain bland. I thought at least I'd have hope with the rice but it was awful. I threw the entire meal in the trash along with the $18 I spent on it. It was just such a mediocre meal and I was disappointed. Sorry Red Tea House, I guess you're just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"So so good. Food is amazingly priced and tastes nice, waiters were polite, attentive, and catered to their elder guests wonderfully. Come here for a casual bite, don't expect something mind blowing or extraordinary and you'll be pleasantly surprised"}
{"text":"Why do I dine anywhere else for Chinese food?  Red Tea House, formerly Sichuan House, a  place I have been visiting for many years, is the best in the region and always has been.  The restaurant is attractive and comfortable.  The staff, led by owner Chen and his wife, are cordial, gracious, accommodating, always with a smile.  I asked the host to provide corkage for our bottle of wine and he not only did that, but provided an ice bucket which he placed at the side of the table: all of this at no charge. I like that the delicious crispy noodles are brought to the table with hot tea and water to begin the meal. The egg rolls are the most delicious and substantive of any ($2.25) and there are three types available.  My favorite Chinese soup is served here: chicken velvet corn soup, which is egg drop soup with chicken.  It was served piping hot. My fiancee had hunan chicken with broccoli, pea pods, and corn.  This was the first time I ordered Thai food here and it was fantastic: pad thai with fried tofu and chicken, $13.  The portions were outstanding and we both had food to take home even though I am a very hearty eater.  For $36+, we had a feast which will make almost two more meals at home.  Red Tea House puts the well-known and well-patronized Sesame Inn to shame, and it is somewhat less expensive. My highest praise to Red Tea House for the perfect dining experience!"}
{"text":"Red tea house is the best Chinese restaurant in this area~ with Sushi Bar and delicious Chinese food!  Moreover, we can bring our own wine which is awesome!   Food is always tasty and fresh ! I love the. Geese wonton and their Ducks !!  And the price is fair enough!"}
{"text":"Oh, maybe I ordered wrong. Or this was the most boring Cantonese style food this close to the east coast. Nostalgic, like food my parents ate in the late '50s. I drowned it in mustard to eat it."}
{"text":"Note #1: Red Tea House offers limited delivery within a 2 mile radius and only from 5PM-9PM daily.   Note #2: They have a sushi bar.  Note #3: RTH also offers egregiously affordable lunch specials Monday through Saturday until 3PM, almost all of which are under $10 (with many as low as $7!), and that includes sushi!   After making our monthly Giant Eagle supermarket trip, Kay and I decided that a Chinese meal just felt like the proper thing to do last Sunday evening, and what better, more convenient choice for such cuisine was there than the Red Tea House,  another of many suburban shopping center surprises around the Pittsburgh area.  Damn it if Kay had to go an order the Plum Duck with its uncannily unctuousness that was felt profoundly by both tooth and taste receptor alike. Nearly without bones and awash in a deep, dark, deadly, dulcet, and depravedly delightful plum sauce the menu incorrectly described as \"delicate,\" I was once again overcome with emulousness over a duck dish Kay had ordered, but the bountiful  portions of both our meals was conducive to sharing, even if Kay was understandably reluctant to do so.   My dish, another of the \"Chef's Specialties\" (I tend to go for these much of the time when dining Asian), was titled The House Rainbow and included in its savory, saliferous, spirited, \"brown sauce\" sea a medley of lobster, shrimp, and poultry...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfIkOld47M  The proteins were yielding and thus cooked skillfully, and the vegetables were varied and profuse, making The House Rainbow absolutely cornucopic...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CREJXaUZ6-g  We skipped dessert due to our large dinners, but found the atmosphere and decor to be as elegant and refined as it was inviting and unhurried. Every staff member was genial, smiling and greeting us upon entry and bidding us farewell upon exit. The service itself was also up to par.  As the sun lulled itself into sleep and the air became lightly frigid, we departed from The Red Tea House with a trunk filled with groceries, vowing to visit again anon...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrQfjaBMWCI"}
{"text":"Red Tea House Grand Opening.  Chinese Cuisine and Sushi Bar.  Nice renovated space, in the same spot as another chinese restaurant but new management and kitchen staff.  Ordered take out but not real crowded when picked up the meal.  Wonton soup and Egg roll were good starters.  The Twice Cooked POrk with cabbage sweet red and green peppers and spicy sauce was very good.  Nice flavors, tender meat and veggies.  Also, had some fried rice which was pretty ordinary.  A nice addition to the area."}
{"text":"The staff are always so friendly and the order always comes out fast.  I always order the same thing, general tsos. There aren't a lot of spices so if you don't mind not having it spicy than this place is good."}
{"text":"The portion of every dish is soooo big!  So good to find a Hong Kong style restaurant for breakfast! Unfortunately there is no English menu for the best breakfast set Go for????? (satay beef instant noodle)  or????? (ham macaroni in chickem stock) the best!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. We got veggie lo mein and the noodles were over cooked and mushy. Plus no flavor. The sushi rolls were only ok, but we didn't get any wasabi ginger with our delivery order. Not sure I would try this place again."}
{"text":"Best Chinese I've found in Pittsburgh, outside of one or two in Sq. Hill.  Some nice dishes you won't find elsewhere."}
{"text":"My husband and I really like this old school Americanized Chinese restaurant!   The food is good and the portions are huge! I love going here and starting off with the hot tea and crispy noodles with duck sauce and hot mustard!   Their egg rolls are delicious as are the scallion pancakes. My husband is also a big fan of their steamed dumplings, but I find them too doughy for my taste.   For entrees you really can't go wrong with the old school General Tso's, but last time we were their we tried the Amazing Chicken and really loved it! The chicken was huge pieces of chicken tenders in a delicious sauce.   I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Why can't I find myself a delicious greasy Chinese place around my hood? Is that too much to ask?? I mean, this joint isn't bad by any means. It's just middle of the road Chinese. I should have gone with my instinct and tried the sushi, but for some reason I really just wanted lo mien.   After sampling Mekong's lo mien on Potomac Ave, I thought it was acceptable, but coming in here I realize that it may have been a notch up from acceptable to fairly okay. I ordered the shrimp lo mien here and it wasn't nearly as filled with the good stuff like Mekong was. Mekong PACKED their lo mien full of veggies. This was just a little shrimp, some cabbage and a ton of noodles. But the noodles weren't very flavorful. I just need a little flava in my life!  So the next time I venture in here I'll be trying the sushi. I think. If I venture in again. We'll see..."}
{"text":"We love this place. Great food, great service. Super friendly.  So glad we found a place that isn't just reheated food from the 80's. My favorite is the orange beef. I usually avoid battered meat at Chinese restaurants, but Red Tea House uses better cuts and less batter. Yum"}
{"text":"If you want quality Chinese food, this is the place to go! The food is simply delicious and always appropriately seasoned just right. I have been here a couple of times and also tried some traditional dishes here. Super delicious!   The sushi here is probably one of the best, if not the best I've had in Pittsburgh. The key to GOOD sushi is fresh ingredients and this place has really fresh and yummy ingredients. My parents are sushi snobs and I'd always take them here for our sashimi fix."}
{"text":"U get what u paid for. For good qui k cheap meal  This place get u that and more. Free drink with set meal and soup!!!"}
