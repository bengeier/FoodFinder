{"text":"The mood was bustling and festive as soon as I walked in.  I came with a large party and it was thoroughly enjoyable - good wine choices, hearty food, helpful service.  We shared the antipasto italiano platter, I had the veal parmigiana as my main course.  Delicious calamari, generous serving sizes.   Also the dessert was excellent!  Thoroughly enjoyed the cheesecake and the tartufo.  Nom nom!  Everyone left in good spirits.  Would definitely recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"Yet another amazing meal at Tutto Pronto and particularly special because we sat on the new 2nd floor patio.   I had the Caesar salad followed by the Fettuccini Bolognese. My Buddy had the avocado salad and Osso Bucco  pasta. Neither one of us were disappointed.   We may have also shared the spicy fries :-)  Check out the new patio if you haven't been....such a great job!"}
{"text":"Tutto Pronto is very good for dining in or ordering in advance for take away. The retail items for lunch or dinner tend to be terribly over-salted most of the time. I must ask for a little taste before I decide whether to buy salads, vegetables, turkey burgers etc. The cooks are very heavy handed with the salt. Do they even taste their dishes before putting them out?"}
{"text":"Got the voucher from Travelzoo and went for brunch with friend of mine.  Nice food on menu.  Good to try if you have voucher (more affordable!) to enjoy their brunch.  (not worth if you pay for full price).  Nice deco.  Good to take a look right next to restaurant where there's a small shop carry ready-to-go entree, jars of preserves and olive oil..etc.  Parking : Paid on Street."}
{"text":"Just came back from our second dinner here (this time we enjoyed ourselves on the rooftop patio). The only reason I didn't give this restaurant 5 stars is that's it's pricey. For example, the very small portion of dessert was $9.00. That said, the food is delicious and the service was attentive without being obtrusive."}
{"text":"Have now eaten a Tutto Pronto twice. Both meals were awesome!!! You can now BYOW and pay a corkage fee; that will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"We came with friends tonight since we wanted Something closeby.  We had dined here years ago but hadn't made it back.  The menu had a lot of great looking options.  We had the paparadelle osso buco which was nice.  My picky eater child enjoyed it.  I ordered the branzino, I thought the menu said whole branzino but it was a bit small like a half or maybe it's because they took the head off.  It tasted good and had a nice crispy skin.  My husband had the scallopini said it was good but not spectacular but he's hard to please.  Our friends had the short rib ravioli and a side of rapini.  The meal was good, portions okay, could use a bit better service our water needed some refilling and they didn't bring a separate cup for my toddler for water.  I'd go back for the food if I want to stay in the area."}
{"text":"The food is fair and the atmosphere is pleasant enough. The overall experience was horrible due to the restaurant arguing with me about the ability to use a Groupon for brunch when the owner's comments on the deal clearly indicated that brunch is part of the deal.   Here are two comments from the Groupon discussion as proof - this is a cut and paste from Groupon: (you can go to the original deal and then click on the discussion link to see all the comments)  Anna G. commented 1 month, 3 days, 15 hours, and 55 minutes ago  Brunch is included in this deal Thanks Anna Maria Graziano - Owner  and just to make sure, another cut and paste comment: Anna G. commented 1 month, 3 days, 14 hours, and 17 minutes ago The $ 15 buy would apply to the brunch menu Anna Maria"}
{"text":"HUGE MISTAKE coming here. So frustrated, I'm wanted to post my first ever picture of food on Yelp (but the option wasn't made available).  First, we have dairy & egg allergies in the group, so we obviously made note of it to our server. He didn't write it down.  Starters Mussels - The mussels themselves were good, but it was cooked in what I would call a tomato soup.  Very strange. Calamari - Didn't even seem real.  My wife didn't even want it after tasting it.  Mains Pizza - Mushrooms were fried in butter, no doubt. Pasta - Dairy intolerance in the group, the whole dish tasted like butter.  After eating some of the pasta, it was just a whole plateful of butter. I would love to post a pic if I had the option.  What a jerk of a place/server. I should've lowballed an even lower tip for this than I did."}
{"text":"Walked into the restaurant this evening at 9pm with my wife and two kids (13 &  11) and asked for a table of four.   They had a table available so started to seat us but when I indicated to them that we were there for dessert,  they said \"I'm sorry,  we don't do that\".   I asked \"you don't serve paying customers?\"  All the host said was that Saturday night is a big night for them.   Now,  I feel for neighborhood restaurants, I live in this neighborhood,  and have done so for over 15 years.   I get that it's a tough business and we see local stores and restaurants closing and opening all the time.   But if you want to survive in this market it seems to me that you should serve ready,  willing,  and paying customers.   Whether this is a \"policy\"  of theirs or not, they had a table available and were ready to serve us.   But the moment they realized it wasn't for a full meal,  they refused us.   I unfortunately do not want the kind of restaurant that discriminates customers in this neighborhood and what they did tonight was absolutely shameful."}
{"text":"Super cute place...looks truly like it was in Italy. Very nice wait staff. Charming atmosphere. Food however...is very average. Stale bread, nasty, dirty looking oil+balsamic dispensers... Grilled Calamari incredibly unappetizing...arrives literally smothered in a salsa-like concoction of chopped tomato and other Impossible to discern green spices...other dishes, less offensive...but all uninspiring. Plating is likewise sad...food just appears slapped onto the plates.  The place is charming, the wait staff is truly delightful...a re-evaluation of the kitchen is essential."}
{"text":"How does this place have such a low rating? I love it here. My review is from a visit for my parents' birthdays. Made a reservation prior but it wasn't full in the restaurant. However we came on a rainy Wednesday evening. There is street parking right in front. Our server was very attentive and kind. I had the arancini to start and it was delicious. My only critique would be a little more sauce with it. It was nice and warm and not overpowered by the cheese. For my main I had the gnocchi and my goodness it was phenomenal. It was the perfect texture and not salty at all. The cream sauce was not too rich, and was complimented well with the squash. I would have licked my bowl if it wasn't so rude. The server noticed I had cleaned out my plate and was very happy to let his chef know. My dad's colleague and friend called the restaurant and ordered a dessert platter for us for my parents' birthdays. It was all so yummy, especially the creme caramel I believe it was. Honestly such a great time. They also have a take out area. I gotta see if they carry gnocchi for take out. And I hear they are opening a patio upstairs. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Arrived last night to a half filled, freezing cold room. Asked for the air conditioning to be lowered as we were not the only ones freezing, as we could tell from the numerous people around us hugging their sweaters. They accommodated, for an hour until they freeze chilled us again.  We waited, and waited and then waited some more to try to flag down a server. Finally we were able to order wine but before we could proceed to our food order, he spun on his heels and raced to the bar.  When the wine arrived 10 minutes later we asked for water and bread and off he went. Water arrived. Bread did not until 10 minutes later, when we asked again. We finally placed our order to a clearly harried and very gruff waiter, who appeared to be the manager.   Half an hour later when the tables around us who had ordered after us received their starters, we flagged down the waiter to ask where ours were and he seemed surprised that we even asked and said, \"I didn't forget about you, you know.\" The salads showed up a few minutes later, clearly forgotten.  Neither wine, nor water were topped up at anytime during the meal.  The salads were fine, a beet salad and a caesar salads, both of ample size and, as I said, fine.  The mains were okay. The pumpkin filled pasta was quite good. The daily special of veal pizzialoa was tender and the vegetables were crisp tender and very good. The sauce was obviously jarred tomato sauce with a handful of capers thrown in and nary a black olive in sight. Fine.  Empty plates sat for a very long time and we were then rushed out.  Would I return, not so much. Lack of service simply wrecked the experience. Too bad."}
{"text":"Wonderful Italian food, good atmosphere, fresh ingredients, seasonal menu, a good experience. Nice rooftop patio, lots of wine and food pairings, up and coming place."}
{"text":"Came to Tutto Pronto with my family as it has become a tradition ever since my sister and I got full-time jobs to treat my parents out to a nice meal.  We ventured up to Avenue Road with a Travel Zoo voucher ($49 for 2 prix fixe dinners) in hand for a night of delightful food.  I have had mixed experiences with dining establishments that are featured on group buying websites.  Its either the portion sizes are too small, the food is mediocre, or we are treated differently than regular-paying customers.  To my surprise, the portion sizes here were generous, the food pleased even my ever-so-critical parents, and the service, though pretty lacking in the earlier part of the evening improved drastically towards the end.  The one inconvenience about its location is that street parking is usually hard to find, and the closest Green P is about 500 metres.  The service was quite slow towards the early part of the evening.  They were quite busy when we arrived at 7:30PM (which is like the dining equivalent of prime time television) and the restaurant was quite full.  The servers seemed to be a bit flustered and disorganized.  When I presented our server with our Travel Zoo voucher, she seemed disgruntled.  And this same server would have me repeating my order at least 2 times and then repeating a totally different menu item back to me.  However, as the early diners vacated their tables, the service improved and the servers were friendlier towards the end of our night.  Water is pre-poured (germaphobes beware?), and the bread basket, with olive spread, butter, olive oil and balsamic are also preset at the table.  Their wine list is not epic, but its not limited either.  The prices are quite reasonable.   or hip, but you can always venture downtown to a bar afterward to be seen and heard.  The prices here are quite reasonable for the quality of food you get and I will definitely be back.  For starters we tried their Roasted Beet Salad, Beef Carpaccio and Caprino Salad (mushrooms, roasted red peppers and goat's cheese).  Their salads were amazing as there were warm components to it and both were very flavourful.  And goat's cheese in any salad for me is super!  The beef carpaccio for me, was not up to snuff.  It was thin, but in a very slimy, gooey texture.  It was definitely the biggest disappointment of the evening.  For mains, it would seem we were blessed with gifts from Poseidon as 4 of the 5 dishes hailed from the sea.  Among them, a Seafood Risotto (x2),  an 8 oz. Sirloin with Tiger Shrimps, and from the Chef's Specials: a linguini with half a lobster and shrimps, and an herb-crusted sea bass.    My word of warning, get the appetizer portion for the Seafood Risotto.  Risotto itself is quite filling - you do not want to order the entrée size.  My cousin was still full 4 hours later when he was about to go to bed.   As both my picky, and hard-to-impress parents would later comment \"Tutto's chef knows how to cook.\"  Everything was so flavourful.  The linguini, no doubt is boiled in a seafood broth of sorts as the noodles themselves were flavourful in their own right.  The tiger shrimps were perfectly grilled and had a nice char to them.    And the steak - as per my father, who almost always orders steak when he dines out - is the best steak he's tasted in any Western restaurant we've taken him to dine at thus far.  Even just looking at it when it was brought to the table promised a nicely-charred, perfectly-marbled steak.    I actually found that my Mediterranean Sea Bass was the blandest in flavour, although I don't think I've ever had a whole fish before other than at a Chinese restaurant.  But the flavour was anything but exciting. The accompanying side vegetables were equally savoury (no doubt also infused with a broth of sorts) and the potatoes were simple but delicious.  And to end of the evening we ordered a few cappuccinos, an espresso and a coffee brewed from the Italian Segafreddo brand.  The coffee was too bland for us, the cappuccinos seemed to be the favourite, but for me the espresso was the highlight.    We ordered the Torta della Nonna (Grandmother's Cake which is made with lemon curd and pine nuts), a Chocolate Fondant Cake and a Tiramisu.  While the majority at the table didn't appreciate the goodness that was Grandmother's Cake, I simply loved it.  It was soft and spongy, and the lemon curd was thick and rich.  The pine nuts added an interesting textural contrast.  And we all loved the little Amaretti cookies that were served with coffee.  Verdict:  This restaurant received praises from all my family members and was definitely a great find.  Everybody enjoyed their meal and my dad was still talking about it when he got home.  It has also usurped Trapper's as our go-to restaurant for Winter/Summerlicious - another tradition that we never miss.  As I mentioned, the service was a little lacklustre but the food will more than make up for it."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!    Food was good but the server was rude and  made me never want to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Tutto Pronto is a cute little  hidden gem, that everyone should know about.   The lunch and dinner scenes vastly differ, and once dinner rolls around, you can hardly recognize the place. The once openly lit restaurant, becomes a dimly lit romantic restaurant with candles everywhere.  As for the food, their beef cappacchio was excellent, and the Caprese Salad was also very tasty. I ordered a Margarita Pizza, which in my opinion was mediocre, but the people I ate with all got sandwiches or pastas that were all really good.  Oh and the Veal Parm was one of the best I've ever had.  During lunch, they also have a take-out area, so people who work in or around the area can pick up lunch.  Next time I'm in the area I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Don't spend your money here!! There are better Italian restaurants in the GTA!  Service is horrible!! \"No gratuity? Yeah yeah customers are always right, they always say everything is slow. Is this your first time eating out?\" These were exact words from our server, a old Caucasian male.   The food was good but the service was the worst ever. I went there with my friend for the first time. I understand that servers look at us and judge because of our young age but it doesn't mean we don't have money. My friend is a doctor and I'm a franchise owner, we definitely have enough money to pay for our food. We waited for our bill for 40 mins and the only reason why we finally got our bill was because my friend decided to stand up. I didn't tip him because the work ethic just wasn't there. These were our server exact words when he saw that I didn't tip. \"No gratuity? Yeah yeah customers are always right, they always say everything is slow. Is this your first time eating out?\" My friend initially wanted to tip but after she heard those words coming out of this mouth, she decided not to tip at all. I am never coming back to this place again and they definitely lost a customer because I host annual parties for all of my franchise stores and when I first walked in, this restaurant seemed very nice but I was wrong and I definitely won't come back ever again. I really hope this restaurant make changes."}
{"text":"I guess I'm not the only one whom the servers were terrible to.   Went in for lunch today by myself since I had some time to kill between two appointments.   The waitress made eye contact with me when I walked in, but she ignored me as she walked right past to another room... This is extremely rude, as even if you were busy you could have acknowledged me with a nod or a smile. This resulted in me standing at the entrance for 5 minutes, lost, until another lady (who wasn't wearing the server's uniform) had me seated.   Being the only East Asian young adult in the store, I'm not sure if it was my age, my ethnicity, or coming here alone, that made the two waitresses think it's okay to treat me coldly. I guess everyone else in the restaurant were Caucasians, old, and/or coming in groups of at least two. The waitresses smiled at other customers but treated me as if I'm here to eat an run or something...I have never felt more unwelcome at a restaurant in the entire Toronto.   The bill came very quickly, but it took a while to catch the waitress's attention for me to actually make the payment. Not a single thank you, or have a nice day, or anything.  I still tipped out of courtesy but to be honest, I shouldn't have.   I got the seafood pasta. It was alright, nothing too special, but honestly, I don't remember the flavor because the taste of rudeness was too strong here.   Two stars for the ambiance and decor in the store"}
{"text":"My cuz and I had the pleasure of dining here tonight. I've been wanting to come here for years as my parents dined there and said the food was wonderful. I've also been very curious about the take out/tiny store that offers hot and cold entrees.  We were the first diners in tonight and service was fast and friendly. The menu is short and sweet, offering a delicious mix of pizza, pasta and entrees. They have a wine menu that offers selections from Canada, the USA, and Italy.  We both got the butternut squash soup to start (it was the soup of the day) and it was a rich blend of butternut goodness. The portion was huge! Wasn't anticipating that.  We accompanied that with two glasses of a very light, fruity white wine.   For my main, I had the risotto. The mushrooms were very fresh and the entire dish was light but filling. My cuz had the seafood fettuccine which had a ton of fresh seafood blended with spaghetti (we were warned ahead of time that they were out of fettuccine).  To complete our dining experience we both decided to indulge in dessert. She had the chocolate cake which, as the name implies, was rich and decadent. I had the coppe pistachio which was a combination of light gelato. Even though I'm not usually a pistachio fan, that was delicious.  Price point is not cheap but the quality more than makes up for it. Will definitely return to try some of their hot and cold table ready-to-go items."}
{"text":"I came here twice, both for birthdays. The staff are very polite, the restaurant is big with seating on the ground, second and patio area. Good menu and good wine selection. I was happy with both meals and would definitely come back again. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant on avenue. Not overly priced and large portions!!! On Thursday it was packed, we only got a reservation at 8:30 ; crazy! They have daily specials which are always great! The funghii pizza is the BEST I've ever had... the pesto adds a great touch. The bread they bring to the table is meh but it's free so you can't complain. I would absolutely return and try something new!!!"}
{"text":"I like coming to Tutto's for their excellent prepared take-out foods.  You can really taste the home made goodness and just about everything I've ordered and eaten here feels like something my Italian mamma (in another lifetime) would have made for me.  But Tutto's takeout menu is not limited to Italian as they offer a diverse array of dishes of and flavours to satisfy any appetite.   My favorites include the ginger chicken wraps with asparagus and brie, the refreshing avocado mango tomato salad and if you're a fan of fried rice, the kitchen manager Jackie makes THE BEST fried rice ever!!! It's made with basmati and veggies with fried egg and it's just right, not runny or greasy or soggy or nauseatingly submerged in soy sauce. It's so perfect that I make a point to order a tub of it each week, along with the chicken and broccoli stir-fry...ahh the things we do for comfort foods!  I should also mention the ladies at the counter (and Tutto's staff in general) are always super nice.  If you feel like dining in, Tutto's is an intimate and rustically cozy space and perfect for either a date or to meet up with a group of friends. I've only dined in once, and lucky me got to be served by the exhuberant owner Anna Maria.  My meal of Penna alla Pollo was terrific!  The right amount of wine and garlic infused sauce with tender chicken breast and spot on al dente penne just like the way (my Japanese) mom used to make it!  If you love good homestyle Italian meals or if you hate cooking and want to grab some great tasting food to go, Tutto Pronto will certainly have something delicious to feed you or your family with the taste of homemade goodness.  Just don't tell my mom that I think their food is just as good if not better than hers!"}
