{"text":"WORST PLACE EVER !!! We ordered last night at 7:45 pm and received the food at 10pm!! When we called at 9:45 they were getting mad at US for being late !! They did not even apologize or try to accommodate us for the late pizzas! We paid 80 2 large cold pizza! I really really really DONT recommend it at ALL !!!  And the delivery guy was rude and mean! No tip for him!
There are other great kosher pizzas in Montreal who take about 20min to bring it and it is a LOT better. 
Highly disappointed in Pita Pizza!"}
{"text":"Had there poutine pizza which was wonderful. Great delivery and I enjoyed all the menu options they had. I will try it again."}
{"text":"Pizza Pita is great kosher pizza joint! The staff are friendly, the food is delicious, and they SUPER popular! 

I tried their sicilian calzone... SO tasty.  Definitely would recommend calling in advance though... they get CRAZY busy and the pickup line for pre-ordered food is a lot shorter!"}
{"text":"Their fully dressed falafel pita sandwich is, oh, so good!!!"}
{"text":"Yuk.... Unless you find yourself in this part of town and must eat Kosher food...avoid at all costs. Yuk"}
{"text":"pizza was great- really flavorful and definitely among the best kosher pizza I've had. The poutine was good (I know its different than the non-kosher type would be). It was really crowded bc we went on Saturday night, but still we got a table and food only tool a few minutes."}
{"text":"The service is slow and the workers don't know how to work productively to get the customers food out in time. The \"hot meal of the day\" looks revolting and not fresh what so ever. I will not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Ok - this place is a mess. Like it's a total breakdown in terms of ordering and getting your food. Total chaos. But having said that - prices were good, quality was good. Staff was nice (is their a tip jar - if not why not? And if so - sorry I couldn't find it!) prices excellent for cholov yisroel dairy.  If you need kosher poutine- this is probably the spot."}
{"text":"The pizza is really not very good, the fries are frozen but the falafel is really good and it's the only thing that keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Shockingly decent. I found myself here simply because it was close to 11pm on a Thursday night, I was staying at the hotel next door, and I desperately needed something to eat. Two of us got slices of pizza, and two others got falafel and fries. The pizza was decent - I mean, I'm from NY, so I'm a little picky when it comes to pizza. However, the slices were a decent size, the crust was thin and crispy, and overall it had a nice flavor. General consensus was that the falafel was pretty good, as well. Service was fast and friendly, and although they were closing they didn't kick us out."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a trip from New York, as it was the only place open in the middle of the night/early morning. This place is different; It had a pizza/sandwich station, the around a corner a pancake/waffle/crepe station, then around a corner an ice cream section, etc. A lot of random stations. It gives this place a cafeteria type of feel. Everyone said their food was decent, there were no complaints. I had Poutine for the first time with is French Fries in Gravy. If you're looking for cheap fast food at odd hours, this is your spot."}
