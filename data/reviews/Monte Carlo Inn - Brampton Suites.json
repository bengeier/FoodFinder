{"text":"The staff are very polite, courteous and check in was very quick. Unfortunately that is the only thing positive about our one night stay. The room is in need of updating, it smelled of stale ashtray, and the mattress is in desperate need of replacing - zero support and my wife and I kept meeting in the middle from the sagging of it. Yes, if you need a place to stay near the airport it's not far, but there are also a lot more choices. Had I paid 60$ for this room, I would say I got what I paid for. Paying double that, I expect more (like not waking up with a sore back)"}
{"text":"This place is a nightmare beyond belief, it's a zero stars. I unfortunately had to stay in this s**thole Bc of a wedding. No one could pay me money to voluntarily stay here. There was an obvious gas leak that smelled like a gas grill in the lobby. Literally over 25 people could smell gas including the firemen and the hotel staff continously denied this.  We had to call the firemen to come and alleviate the situation. When we asked them to they refused. The hotel staff refused to allow us to talk to the manager, were complete a**holes, and kept us outside without attempting to help us. This place is literally a joke out of a movie. I'm embarrassed by this place. This hotel can go to hell. Hopefully there is a Canadian version of the better business bureau and I'll be tweeting something on this if this hotel chain if they even have an Instagram to tweet on. Worst customer service I have ever had in not a third world country."}
{"text":"I stayed at this hotel during a trip to Canada during the Summer.  The staff and housekeeping were really nice and understood what I needed.  The room was good, although I wish there were blackout curtains for the window. It looked like no windows had blackout curtains and you can see the lights from the streets and businesses nearby come into the room during nighttime.

The TV was hard to understand at first, but figured it out quickly.  The room has a microwave and fridge.  And there were ice machines, although I wished there were ice machines on each floor.  You do get breakfast each morning in the restaurant, but it's pretty basic.  And if you want a hot breakfast you have to pay $5. There are also plenty of restaurants and stores like Wal-Mart really near this hotel.  It was a good hotel to stay in and I would stay there again."}
{"text":"Excellent service and comfortable, clean stay. 3 Thumbs up...totally recommend and close to Walmart and other stores/amenities."}
