{"text":"The food is very creative. the wine list is impressive. The atmosphere is great and the decoration is top. The service is very good. If you have the occasion have a dinner there."}
{"text":"It's only just starting, but overpriced for very underwhelming cuisine.  Sorry, but in MTL, there are too many better options.  If you're just into wine, maybe...."}
{"text":"Went there for a family dinner and it was a nice discovery for everyone. Wine pairing was good and the food was delicious. I had the octopus as first dish and probably one of the best I had in my life. I had the scallops as main and it was perfectly cooked and the flavors were on point. The place was not too loud and the quality of the service was better than what I read in other reviews. The waitress didn't came to see if everything was going well during the main course though. Everyone at the table had different wines by the glass, even champagne and it was a good experience overall. The only bad thing I would say is the pana cotta was really watery, like yogurt. Even the couple next to us were curious about it."}
{"text":"Pretty much what the other negative reviewers said. The room is really nice, and the food has potential but truly terrible service and awful pacing make this place a pass. When we were there the table right beside us was complaining at the same time and we both agreed we'd likely never be back. Servers blamed the kitchen, but the food was decent and communication was non-existent until the end when we complained, so I think it's a front of house problem.   First off we did the tasting menu with wine pairing - in my books there's only one rule with this setup, make sure you pace the meal so that pours and plates are happening in close succession. On 3 out of 6 courses the wine was gone before the food showed up and we had to ask for refills. Not the end of the world and I don't think they charged us for refills but shows they don't really have their timing down. Also, what's up with asking \"wasn't that great?\" After every course? Then when you kind of smile and nod your head there's no follow through. No one actually cares if the food is good, they just want you to acknowledge that it is. And it kinda was - the white asparagus was traditional and tasty, the turbot soft and rich and again very classically done. The bavette was competent, and the desserts pretty tasty. I'm still having a hard time placing why I hated this meal so much, but part of it was definitely that everything was so samey - the opening course had broccoli with shaved Parmesan on top, oysters, and little brioches with more Parmesan - weird right? The white sauce for the asparagus was the same as the white sauce for the turbot, plus or minus some doctoring up. There was just a lack of variety and the fact that they think they're serving amazing food is just a turn off. It's \"fine\", not awful, not great. If the service was amazing I'd probably be coming back to see if the food gets better.   Unfortunately the service was terrible. Not malicious, just incompetent. Servers laying across the table to lay cutlery, bringing a single half teaspoon of butter for that whole table , pouring still water on top of sparkling, hovering awkwardly but still leaving glasses unfilled but then trying to take food away that's not done, it was actually creating stress having these people serve us. At one point both our table and the one next to us got up to ask the waiter (who was on the computer) to serve some wine and refill water after we sat there for 20m staring at empty glasses wondering if the meal was over (we both had additional courses but weren't even sure). In the end the guy we complained to just kind of shrugged and seemed pissed off, didnt seem to want to dig in and understand the feedback, so I don't see this place getting better fast. No-one seems to care.   Lastly, their maitre-D needs a bath. The dude honestly smelled like he just rolled out of a brothel."}
{"text":"Where to begin? Neither my date nor I speak French, but like many others we decided to come to Montreal to spend New Years. Not sure how, but we somehow managed to get a reservation the day of and had no idea that the meal was going to be a 7-course vegetarian tasting menu with wine pairing.  Did I mention it was all vegetarian?  Cray!  I can't say much for the regular dining experience but our New Years was on fire from start to finish.  The entire meal was more than 3 hours long and well worth the time and money.   Besides, we were there past midnight.  Que chido!  Highlights: Other than the more than outstanding service, the dishes that I will remember for many years to come are the fried onions with truffles, squash wellington, and the very cool and weird dessert of cherry tomatoes on meringue and creme fraiche with tomato jam.  I loved it so much.  And I love you, M.Mme.  Why this place has such an average rating is blowing my mind.  Come here and have a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Bar à vins avec une très belle carte. Les mardis soirs, ils organisent une soirée de dégustation pour 23$ qui permet aux invités de déguster 10 vins. La dégustation est animée par le chef sommelier et d'autres sommeliers. Ils sont très accueillants et accessibles.   J'étais venu souper avec des amies proche de leur ouverture. Ils ont un menu intéressant. On avait partagé plusieurs plats et nous avons bien apprécié le service et les recommandations du serveur. Ce n'est pas un restaurant pour un budget étudiant.   L'endroit est beau, avec beaucoup de bois, un gros bar central, un mur de vins. L'ambiance est tamisé et romantique."}
{"text":"M.Mme est un restaurant unique à Montréal ! Ce bar à vin à l'un des meilleur cellier en ville et le menu est excellent ! Cela faisait longtemps que je n'avais pas vécu une expérience aussi formidable dans un resto de Montréal !   Le service etait parfait et le vin n'est pas trop dispendieux (36$ une bouteille d'espagne d'importation privée)  C'est un peu dispendieux (60$ le 3 services ), mais la qualité des repas compense pour le prix  Nous allons retourner très souvent à ce petit restaurant c'est certain !"}
{"text":"Belle ambiance intime, belle carte de vin. En ce qui me concerne, j'ai goûté au gâteau de crêpes au foie gras et topinambour, chapelure de chocolat et vinaigre de pommes caramélisées ains qu'au calmars saisis, aïgo-boulido noir, pâte de citron Meyer, poudre de piment et coeurs de sucrine. Une belle portion, généreuse.  Côté dessert, le gâteau aux panais, crémeux au chocolat blanc et yogourt, granité aux pommes et mousse au fromage à la crème était léger agréable en bouche.  Le service était impeccable. Un peu coûteux mais ca vaut l'expérience."}
{"text":"First off, the service was unacceptable.  Our waiter was principally and I should say exclusively interested in providing attentive and professional service to my friend.  And as others have mentioned there is a bit of waiting time between dishes.  The recommendations were not impressive.  The wines were not impressive.  The pours were not impressive.  Whoever curated the wine menu is not very good.  I recently was in NYC and I have been to a couple of other wine bars there in the past few weeks, where I was delighted with the wine recommendations as well as the wines.         Food itself was pretty run of the mill for Montreal.  Not much better and not much worse.    The way it ends up expensive is because the right hand of the menu lists several appetizer type dishes at more of entree prices.  They only serve small and medium-sized dishes.  But many are priced high for a small-medium dish.    From the appetizer side I had  the princess scallops.  It was the dish that I liked best overall.  It's $11 for two small-medium scallops but it's a fairly complex preparation and thus worthwhile.  The ham and cheese gougeres recommended by my server were 4 pastries served room temp, with a little grated ham perched atop with grated cheese all over.  It needed a lot more ham and lot more cheese, preferably hot and melted and with a bit more bite    From the 'medium' dishes side of the menu I had a yellowtail crudo with sliced radishes which amounted to a decent-sized appetizer.  My duck foie gras dish was another appetizer sort of dish and with some whipped foie gras slivers spread out in on a plate along with slices of strawberry.  Etc.  My friend asked me what I thought and I said that I wasn't blown away.  She said that she was not either.   Music was ever so annoying.  Among other music I didn't really enjoy, I won't be your beast of burden playing on a loop.  Aggravating and unpleasant experience.  The wine and the food do not surmount the service and the spotty value.  Moreover, a wine bar that doesn't do wine well?! Forget about it...Won't go back."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try m.mme for a while now.  As one of the very exciting wine bars to open right when the wine bar hype was at its fullest in montreal. It was supposedly able to stand out with what's truly important: the wine offer.  My first try was pretty much 100% what I was expecting. A huge wall featuring the most amazing wines from the best producer. Good food, even if the star was still the wines. A very casual and friendly ambiance. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Bonne sélection de vins (mais attention, certains vins au verre sont à 25$, ça peut faire monter une facture rapidement), serveurs avec de bonnes connaissances en sommellerie.  Plats délicieux, incluant les desserts. Petites portions toutefois.  Service correct, sympathique, mais sans plus. Le restaurant était pratiquement vide et on nous a laissé avec des verres vides pendant un bon moment avant qu'on reussisse à attirer l'attention d'un serveur.  Bref, nous avons passé un bon moment, mais le restaurant n'est pas comparable à d'autres bars à vin de Montréal, comme le Pullman par exemple."}
{"text":"Nouveau restaurant préféré à moi et mon copain ! Non seulement la place est absolument charmante, les serveurs sympathiques, mais la bouffe est exquise du début à la fin! Nous avons mangé comme des rois ! Ce restaurant est à essayé si vous aimez les bistros français qui sortent des sentiers battus!   Ils offrent plusieurs options pour le souper, soit à la carte, en table d'hôte 3 ou 4 services ou encore un menu dégustation! Je tiens à préciser que le gâteau pancake de foie gras est dé-lec-ta-ble !! A essayer absolument !!"}
{"text":"The first time I walked into that wine bar the first thought that came to mind was fine champagne with exquisite appetizers. Well I wasn't wrong. Dim lights, intimate ambiance and picture perfect appetizers. It's an all around beautiful place you have to try."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try this resto for quite some time and it did not disappoint. Service was good and the food was even better. Those little fritter things are just out of this world. Do yourselves a favour and order it. Even the simple mushroom sandwiches were a hit.  Great place for a small group or even just a date. I think they even have a private room downstairs."}
{"text":"Last month, for the event of MTL à Table 2016, I found myself on Laurier street to try a relatively new wine bar that has opened up there, M.Mme. Owned by the proprietors of Toi, Moi et Café next door and helmed by chef Stelio Perombelon - previously of Lemeac, Les Chèvres, Pullman et Les Cons Servent, M.Mme has gotten some good reviews since its opening end of 2015. Looking over the different menus for MTL à Table, I was intrigued by their offerings and I love a good wine bar so this seemed like a worthwhile try.  First off, M. Mme is a beautiful restaurant - very much in keeping with its location on Laurier Ave. The main focal point is the gigantic glassed-in wine cellar that makes up the entire west wall of the room. The rest of the space is a mixture of wood panelling, bricks walls, leather chairs and banquettes and a stone bar. The open kitchen is in the back and visible for all to see.  As with the usual MTL à Table set-up, we had a couple of options to choose from for starters, mains and desserts. The first starter was a salad of roasted beets and salted prunes with caramelized yogourt and mustard shoots. A beautiful dish to look at - that would be true of every plate we would receive this evening - but sadly it fell flat for our table. The beets lacked flavour and there wasn't enough of the salted prunes to provide contrast within the dish. The yogourt was nice but without the stars of the dish working, it felt insufficient.  The second starter faired much better: Quebec buffalo mozzarella with a salad of cabbage, roasted shallots and BC caviar. The cheese had a lovely texture and great flavour. The addition of the salty caviar, the sweet shallots and the cabbage provided some nice supporting notes to the cheese. I would simply say I wished the portion was larger. It didn't necessarily feel satisfying enough even as a starter.  Our first main - Seared beef with dried spinach, Dauphines potatoes, mushroom puree and cherry red wine reduction - was a big hit to me flavour-wise. The beef was beautiful and cooked perfectly. Loved the exterior crunch on the potatoes and the sweetness of the reduction. My issue again would be with the portion size. I understand this is a wine bar where portions are often smaller and designed to share but if you are going to participate in MTL à Table, you need to ensure you make portions to satisfy people having a full meal. This size of this dish would work as a starter, not a main in my opinion.  Our second dish was sadly disappointing. Seared cod with fennel, smoked red pepper sauce, green grapes and verjus came off as flat. The cod was nice but other than the smoked red pepper sauce, the rest of the dish didn't bring as much flavour to the dish as wanted.  The desserts were similarly mixed. I loved the candy cap profiteroles with bacon streusel, miso caramel and chantilly. A nice rich cream with the fatty bacon and the sweet caramel. Awesome sweet and savoury combination. However, the 'Mexican' chocolate vegan cream with chiffon cake and camerise fruit failed to illicit much positivity from the table. The chocolate was not sweet enough and lacking a nice texture to enjoy. The chiffon cake did nothing and the camerise didn't mix well with the chocolate flavour for most of us.  M.Mme was a very uneven experience. The room is beautiful, the wine was good but the food was too up and down and the portions left much to desired. When you leave a restaurant still hungry, it doesn't really matter how beautiful the plates looked. In the end, perhaps they should have offered an extra plate to the proceedings to more properly match up to a full meal experience. Otherwise, I would have liked to have at least been told upfront to order extra - even if that defeats the whole MTL à Table experience. M. Mme is a beautiful wine bar - it just needs to fill us up a bit more to truly satisfy.  Cheers!"}
