{"text":"I don't usually review places that I've only been to once, but since this is a new place I'll make an exception to my little rule.  Byrd's is average.  That's the best way to describe it.  The decor is pleasant but not that interesting; most new restaurants in the Madison area have the same prairie-style vibe to them.  There are TVs all over the place, which I suppose is to draw in the sports fans, but when I was there there for lunch on a Saturday there were only two or three other groups of diners.  The food seems pretty good, but again, the menu is average.  They have a lot of burgers and your usual selection of sandwiches, pizzas, salads, and a few entrees.  Prices are average as well; the average at lunch is probably nine to ten dollars an entree.  I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich with home-made chips and it was as good as I could hope for.  The chips were crisp and fresh.  The buffalo sauce on the sandwich was not too spicy and the breading on the chicken was really nice.  It comes with bleu cheese dressing, but the kitchen apparently forgot that (cut them some slack, it's a new business) so it was sent out sans dressing.  I didn't notice right away and had to wait for our waitress to come back to check on us so I could notify her.  She took it back to the kitchen and then came out with the sandwich untouched and a little container of bleu cheese on the side.  Uh, why did you need to take my plate when you could have just brought out the bleu cheese?  I was working on those chips!  Anyway, it wasn't really a big deal and the waitress was appropriately apologetic without sounding insincere.  I was a little disappointed that the sandwich came with bleu cheese dressing and not actual bleu cheese, but I've come to expect it since lots of places do it.  My dining companions all enjoyed their food, although none of them thought it was spectacular.  I read another review that accused Byrd's of using pre-made frozen burger patties, but if my brother (who ordered a cheeseburger) noticed, he didn't say anything.  I will probably be back if only to try the cheese curd burger.  However, I don't think this will ever become one of my favorite places to eat, given the large amount of similarly-styled competitors and the sheer averageness of this place."}
{"text":"We'd heard good things about Byrd's and went on a Friday night at 7pm to try it.   Unfortunately we received really bad food and mediocre service.  The bill was $90 for 4 people who had fish fry and 4 drinks This rating is for selecting this place for dinner.  It seems like it would be a good place to have an after work drink but not for dining.  Tip: Don't get the baked cod or the fried perch.  The parking lot was packed which was a good sign.  We were greeted at the door by the manager and shepherded to a table.  The seating layout isn't too good, the afterwork drinking crowd is interspersed with the dinner people.  Basically you've got a bunch of semi-drunk people yelling to each other within 10 feet of your table.  We all tried the \"fantastic fish fry\" which was highlighted as a special.  Unfortunately before the food came, another waitress spilled a beer on my friend.  She mumbled something about trying to get a discount from the manager but we never saw her again.  We mentioned to our waitress that this happened.     When the food came, the baked cod was actually cold, not even warm.  We mentioned this to the waitress and she took it to the kitchen to warm it.   It did come back warm, not hot. Everyone agreed that the baked cod was terrible tasting.  Now I had the fried perch and it seriously looked like I got 5 little potato chips made of perch.  Our friends joked that I could have fit them all in my mouth at once.  They were warm and tasted fine but it was the smallest portion of fish I've ever seen.  The waitress asked us if the food was good and we said that it was not.  She stated that maybe we would like it better the next time we came.    I wondered where the management was that greeted us at the door?  When your waitress knows that 1) you've had a full beer spilled on you and 2) your food was ice cold, and 3)  Didn''t taste good after it was warmed up, you'd think that would be enough strikes for the manager to come apologize?  Never saw them and I wouldn't order the fish again."}
{"text":"-PRIVATE PARTY REVIEW- We had our rehearsal here on a Friday night a couple of weeks ago up in the private room/bar area.  We live outside of Chicago but are from Middleton and chose this place as it is a great location, moderately priced and had a party room with no room charge (which is nice).  We mostly worked with the banquet manager and head cook over the phone and they were very accomodating!  We made up our own menu for the party and the cook helped make suggestions on food and quantity, even was honest and told us we were probably ordering too much.  The staff was great, we didn't even notice them bring the food in and out and the bar staff was very attententive, coming around and being up at the bar for us.  We were able to bring in our own cake for dessert and keep in their fridge until the party and they took care of everything else!  They let us bring in our own decorations earlier in the day as well.  You don't get the whole outside patio to yourself if you book the party room but you can still use it (which we did) and it was mostly cleared out with customers by the end of the night anyways!  Great staff, good food, good prices.  :-)    *we had the baked cod and Italian chicken, roasted red potatoes, swedish meatballs and artichoke dip (for 30 people)"}
{"text":"Figured I'd need to try Byrd's(which has recently opened--I'm assuming it's linked to the one in Fitchburg), seeing how it's only a few blocks from home, so we went here tonight after hearing that the Friday Night Fish was good.  The building is spacious, but we didn't get too good of a look, because we headed right upstairs to sit outside on the patio because it was a gorgeous night. Both my boyfriend and I thought that it was a nice spot, being nestled between the two sides of the building, ensuring that it wouldn't get too breezy.  We decided to split dishes. I got the aforementioned fish, and he the bacon cheese curd burger(it is, after all a BAR...can you resist at least TRYING a burger???). The burger has bits of bacon and cheese curds right inside, with caramelized onions. We both thought it was decent, but the concept was better than the product. Nothing special, but not bad. I think the fish was on the same level. I'm such a fish snob, and I'm still searching for the perfect spot(send me a message, fellow yelpers, if you have a suggestion!). This isn't it. The fish was okay, paired with the average waffle  fries and not-so-great coleslaw, and a crusty(in a bad way) roll.   The service was also not worth mentioning. Mediocre at best. I think they're still getting up and running, and working on getting things smoothed out. I will be back at least ONE more time, however. The salads looked decent, and they have FRIED PICKLES!!!"}
{"text":"I was there on Mardi Gras for trivia night and drinks.  Had a really fun time with some friends and ate a huge burger.  The bartender would not believe that I could consume the whole thing.  I special ordered so I could get the egg on there and then some onion crisps as well.  The fries are really good and the selection of beer had what I was looking for. I consumed all of that to the astonishment of the staff. (I am not a huge guy)  The staff is really friendly and cool.  They all seem like people I would hang out with outside of the bar.  They came through with all the stuff I needed and made my burger just how I wanted it.  Trivia night is interesting but it wasn't spectacular.  The trivia guy is sort of lame, but the questions are decent.  Our team ended up loosing horribly by gambling everything on the final question.. tragic!"}
{"text":"Had been meaning to check out for a while I decided to try Byrd's Pub & Grill in Middleton while waiting for my husband's flight to come in. I walked into the sports-bar environment and the place seemed reasonably busy, but not too crowded or noisy. There was no hostess seating so I found an open booth and sat down.   The table was sopping wet.   A waitress came buy reasonably quickly with a menu and I asked her for something to wipe down the table. She replied that it'd had just been cleaned. I responded that I just wanted something to dry it off. She said \"Okay, but it's still going to be that sticky.\"   Not an appetizing response. I left and won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about Byrd's as a whole, but there are parts of this restaurant that I really like.  For a nice summer spot to relax, have a few drinks, and eat some decent food, they are right on the money.  Here's a little rundown -  The Good:  Large tables with umbrellas for some shade and a comfy outdoor atmosphere in a nice shopping area.  You really can't be in a bad mood sipping a drink when you're out in some nice weather on the rooftop.  The second waitress we had was extremely polite and had good conversation with us.  Their food, while standard deep-fried bar fare, was tasty.  I've been to a lot of outdoor seatings areas in Madison, but I would say that Byrd's is better than most and should be on the short-list.  The Bad:  Our first waitress was easily the worst I've ever seen in my entire life.  I really hope it was her last day.  She came out and was immediately rude with a pissed off look on her face.  I asked for a lime margarita and she said \"we don't do flavors\" and I said OK then a standard margarita which is lime anyways.  She was also just being short with everyone.  When she came back, one of my bolder friends apologized and said she was sorry if we upset her to which the waitress responded \"Well we have stairs.  I have to walk up and down them.  SO THATS WHY THERES A WAIT.\"  She eventually brought our food out as we watched plenty of other happy tables with other waitresses, and then while we were enjoying our drinks and food she asked us if we were leaving.  I said \"uh, no, we were planning on staying a while to relax and have some more drinks (not to mention finish our food)\".  She then demanded that we close our tabs and pay our check because she had to leave and didn't want to get stiffed.  We debated this with her for like 10 minutes until finally we just threw up our hands and did what she wanted (even after offering her straight cash in her pocket for a tip).  We then got a second waitress who opened a new tab and was very pleasant as mentioned above.  So overall, 3 stars because of that horrible ordeal, otherwise Byrds is a great summer locale."}
