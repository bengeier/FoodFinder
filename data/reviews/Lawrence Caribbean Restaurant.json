{"text":"This was my first time.  OMG. It was so good and I was so hungry I forgot the pictures.  I ordered a large and a small oxtails to go.  Next time a must remember to say gravy on my rice and peas.  These are the best oxtails I've had in Charlotte since Down to the Bone closed down several years ago.  I will be back. I must visit."}
{"text":"I visited Lawrence's on last Tuesday and ordered the oxtails and rice with cabbage and mac n cheese as the sides. The oxtails were not fatty and were absolutely delicious. The cabbage was cooked to perfection and the Mac n cheese did not disappoint! I will certainly be visiting this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and staff is very friendly. Great little place that's within Uber distance from the airport. Was in and out quick.  Had the jerk chicken that came with sides of beans, rice, plantains, and cabbage. Big portions that could be split if you're not too hungry."}
{"text":"I brought my team to Lawrence Caribbean Kitchen last night for dinner. The food was incredible and the service was impeccable! 
My Lawrence and his crew was able to accomadate my team of 20 people with no problem. There was enough seating for us to eat in.
Team Comments:
\"The goat is so tender\" 
\"This curry chicken is incredible\" 
\"Best brown stew snapper I have had in a long time\"
I could go on and on. 
When you can serve 20 people and not one person has a complaint that is a blessing (with my team it is a miracle).
Mr. Lawrence may God continue to bless your business. Thank you to you and your staff  for service with a smile.It goes a long way. 
Anytime FDU Track and Field is in town we will be stopping by!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you!! I'm married to a West Indian which makes me West Indian. lol. For years we went to Austin's on Kings Dr. Then they changed ownership. Then Mama's on Central. But as much as I love this place, unfortunately if mama is not in the kitchen, the food is seriously a C-. So we haven't had our Island fix in months.   Picking up my mother n law from the airport last week I detoured up West Blvd and just about did a wheeley turning around when I saw Lawerence Caribbean Restaurant. My very authentic Guyanese mother n law was not excited. Between her cooking and living in NY where all ethnicities of food are plentiful she would have rather had Popeyes. 

We ordered Oxtails, and Jerk chicken, collards and mac. I pretty much hate all Island mac because they put curry in the sauce. BEST mac ever, and no curry. My freakin Jerk---OMG!!  Just enough heat not over bearing. And the oxtails and gravy (because you must judge them separately)..AMAZING and AMAZING!! Only complaint, they could give you a bit more. But hey..I had to say something negative. 

Finally we have our Island food back! And I'm sorry if one time during this article you said \"what about Anthony's\"... you have no absolutely no idea what Caribbean food taste like. And that amazing very Guyanese thick accent mother n law of mine, \"I can't believe dey have gud food like dis down here\". Yep...told ya!"}
{"text":"Spent a few days in Charlotte and wanted some good food vs fast food. Looked up some.area spots and read a few reviews. Lawrence Jamaican spot had a great star rating. Come to find out i was only 5 mins away. Went for food and was not disappointed at tall. Gave it a 4 star because parking was tricky."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The cook/ owner and cashier are always friendly. The food is authentic, excellent and  delicious . I have never had a bad experience. 
Tip: On busier days, Fridays and weekends , it is good to call in your orders to shorten wait time."}
{"text":"Had the jerk chicken combo with a little gravy on the rice and beans (a must!). I'm used to a saucier jerk chicken, this is like a dry rub but it had great flavor! Good portions and the plantains were better than any I've ever had! Already craving them again!"}
{"text":"Best oxtails in the State! Everything is great on the menu and made fresh daily. I drive from uptown Charlotte once a week to get my West Indian food. One love!"}
{"text":"They have great Jerk Chicken. Beans and rice were dry and not moist enough. The cabbage was ok, but too sweet for me. I also had theac and cheese which was not good. I would go back for the nerk chicken and try other sides."}
{"text":"Much better experience this time. Had oxtail, Mac & cheese, cabbage, and plantains.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"The best authentic Caribbean food in the Charlotte-Metro area! I'm from Fort Lauderdale, FL where delicious, home-cooked Caribbean cuisine can be found on just about every major intersection so when I moved here a few years ago I was on a mission to find something comparable. I've tried a few other Caribbean restaurants in Charlotte, however none come close to the quality, authentic flavor, and excellent customer service perfected by Lawrence Caribbean Restaurant. Staff is super friendly and welcoming. I've put a few of my friends on to this place, all of whom agree that this is the go-to place when craving great Caribbean food. I highly recommend this restaurant and will be back."}
{"text":"By far, the best Caribbean joint in Charlotte... I'm from New York, an we've been looking for a good Caribbean spot since we moved here in 2009.. 

The oxtails/rice & peas, gravy (delish), cabbage & plantains, OooohWeeeeee.. Just saying.. 
If you're looking for some Authentic Caribbean food, check this place out..

Note: We did take-out. Drive home was 25min.... Food was still hot!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Caribbean food in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Amazing jerk chicken, peas and rice, Mac and cheese all excellent.  This is authentic Jamaican food that is just like Jamaica!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service.  Cold beer, great music. Im impressed by this place. I ate the currie shrimp, delicious."}
{"text":"Love the food is it so good. The closest to Caribbean taste and flavor since moving to Charlotte. Take it from a Caribbean person you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Today was my first time ordering from this specific restaurant. Compared to a couple other local Caribbean restaurants this by far was the best. The food was fresh, the cabbage wasn't soggy, the rice and peas weren't over cooked, and the white jerk chicken was tender with a mild flavoring which was very tasteful. I would recommend some extra sauce on the white jerk chicken but overall it was excellent. I would've rated this restaurant a 5 but I'm deducting a star due to me asking for double cabbage instead of rice and peas and cabbage. My husband and I were very satisfied will return in the future. Also I'm not sure if he over charged us, but next time I will ask for prices."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. If you get the chance to be there when Lawrence is, you will know that he's a very down to earth guy and takes pride in his restaurant. I recommend the stew chicken and have heard the jerk chicken is great also"}
{"text":"Needs a facelift.  Very friendly.  Food-wise, I've had better in Cary NC.  Jerk chicken was dry, collards were tasteless.  Not bad, but not great either.  Jamaican food can be amazing, but this misses the target."}
{"text":"Straight to the point on this one, the chicken curry had quite a lot of bone fragments in it. Granted I visited near the end of business hours around 8pm.

Other than the above, the flavors were good and I'll echo everyone's call about the portions being generous. At 8pm, the jerk chicken was dry and old from earlier in the day, but the plantains were so damn good they left me wanting more.

The setting and location of this place is odd, and the ambience is a no frills get your food, sit and eat then go type of place. I wouldn't recommend it for a group or dining in. Takeout is perfect.

All in all, I would give this place another try but earlier in the day. Do not come here past 7pm."}
{"text":"Really good really friendly really tight parking maybe because a lot of people come here for lunch"}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this place, I will come back and try more things to give a better overall review. I was greeted promptly. My questions were answered and I received what I asked for."}
{"text":"Delivery took forever. Chicken, rice and peas was dry.  Needed gravy/sauce.   My midnight snack of wings and fries was much better compared to the jerk chicken I ordered. I was disappointed overall."}
{"text":"We just had dinner here. Delicious Urey chicken and the rice and beans was just right. Friendly people, could use a fan on the patio. Is 94 degrees out today. 
We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love coming here with my friends. Last time I ordered Curry Goat, rice and beans, plantiens, slaw, beef pattie and coco bread. All of it was delicious! I truly recommend you stop by and give them a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was ok but nothing to write home about. I ordered a jerk chicken rice and peas and plantain my husband had the curry goat. Chicken was pale which was my first indication I ordered the wrong thing. My husband goat need to simmer a little longer. Rice must have burnt in the pot cause I could smell it. I'll pass! Best part of the meal was the plantain. Oh and my bun and cheese boooooo! Think it was microwaved."}
{"text":"Hey listen!!! Pulled up to a party!!! Reggae blessing up the space! Food was ready from our call in! What more can a girl ask for?!? Besides the food being delicious!!! And my goodness!!! It was soooo good!! I am VERY PICKY about my ackee&saltfish! And I was pleased! Can't wait to get back to Queen City! This will be my first stop!!! My sis had roti and she loved it!"}
{"text":"The food tasted fine however the portion size on the white meat was tiny.  I do believe if your going to upcharge for meat you should be fair and service properly."}
{"text":"OMG.  This place is great.

Tiny, so you may end up having to take it with you, but this food is excellent.

I didn't try the oxtail, but everyone in line ordered it.   I walked in and it smelled like Jamaica (the good parts).

Close to the airport.   I ate mine in the admiral's club"}
{"text":"Very nice  people,  but the food is not worth the money. I will not go back the jeck chicken was all bones with very little meat. Very unhappy customer."}
{"text":"The food was awesome and quick, perfect amount of heat and the collard greens and plantains were great. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here. Guys behind the counter are very welcoming. The food is great and it's well run. 

Make sure you try some plantains."}
{"text":"Close to the airport and they have great food. Today I had The oxtail, the only thing that bothered me was that the plantain were almost cold. They need to be served fresh or should I say they taste better fresh. Other than that everting was on point. A little pricey also. I paid $14.50 for a large Oxtail."}
{"text":"I just ordered take out from here & it is TERRIBLE! The worst Jamaican I've ever gotten & ive been here before. I ordered jerk chicken which has NO flavor, no sauce was on it so it was extremely dry, the mac & cheese was too mushy, the rice was extremely bland, the plantains were over cooked & mushy & the yams were whole dry yams with no sweetness! I am extremely disappointed and will never return."}
{"text":"I finally found a Caribbean restaurant in Charlotte that I absolutely love. I ordered the small oxtail and they were meaty, tender and delicious! Good portion size not too small. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome food, fast service. I came after 5 pm and the previous order purchased the last of the chicken patties. Nice size portions"}
{"text":"Lawrence Caribbean Restaurant is a place any person not from Charlotte should consider visiting during there stay here in Charlotte. It provides a different experience then any other establishment in it's area. There is complimentary high speed Wi-Fi services along with a High Def Television to view while waiting to place a order or receive your food. The environment is very soothing & relaxing with the selection of Caribbean music that plays both indoors & outdoors (There is a nice outdoor patio area). Also, the food is prepared where it is all visible to the customers. The level of customer service is very professional & all the food I've ever ordered has been prepared in a timely manner. In addition I would recommend anyone visiting to try the chicken patties."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this place scrolling on yelp to find something to eat after riding around viewing various neighborhoods. When we first pulled up, parking was a easy but limited.

There is a ramp on the outside if you need handicap accessibility which is very considerate for the location and small area. 

I loved that hand written menu boards because they show the authentic and original sense of the food. 

The cashier lady was nice and accommodating. The man made sure we got our food promptly. Just a heads up, ask for the key for the restroom. I stood for 3 minutes knocking to see if someone was in there and another patron told me to ask for the key, lol. 

My husband and I got 2 plates, one with oxtails, rice and peas, cabbage and plantains, with a side of macaroni and cheese. The other, curry goat, rice and peas, cabbages and plantains. 

The oxtails were tender, perfectly cooked, and a good size. The curry chicken was flavorful with a hint of spicy. Cabbages were cooked just right and I love how they were sliced. The rice and peas, were ok, the gravy from the oxtails makes them more flavorful. The plantains were cooked perfectly and added just that little bit of sweetness. 

We sat outside on the patio and enjoyed our meal. It was the perfect time, about 7:30 pm.  Surprisingly, we didn't have to deal with any insects sitting outside. 

Overall, it was great, and my husband and I could only eat half of our food, and we saved it for later at the room. We will be eating here again soon!"}
{"text":"Great find near my hotel at Charlotte airport.  So glad that I picked up food from here as opposed to eating at the hotel restaurant.  I ordered the jerk chicken and the curried goat - both...  Both were absolutely wonderful.  There was way more food that I could eat, but I wanted  to taste both, since they are two of my favorite dishes from the Caribbean.  If I had to pick, the goat was likely better than the chicken, but both were wonderful.  The restaurant had a few small tables, but looks like they do most of their business as takeout.  It smells amazing when you walk in the door too!  The server, who may likely have been the owner, was super friendly!  Finally, I would be remiss if I failed to comment on the cleanliness.  It was absolutely immaculate inside.  Clearly the owner/manager really cares about the restaurant and the food that they serve to their customers.  I will absolutely return here on my next visit to Charlotte.  I might even make the trip if I have a long enough layover between flights..."}
{"text":"New to the area and found this hidden gem! I had the jerk chicken and it was awesome! I had the dark meat option and loved it. The sweet plantains as a side paired so well with the heat from the jerk spices! And the rice wasn't over cooked. I hate over cooked rice and this was perfection!

Do yourself a favor and stop by!"}
{"text":"Definitely more of a take-out place than an eat-in, but they do have a few tables if you'd like to stay.

The helpings are very generous and I enjoyed my lunch of macaroni & cheese, plantains & a beef-something (I can't remember the name! It was a hot-pocket, emapanda type item)."}
{"text":"Oh my.  Walking through the door I am warmly greeted on a chilly November day by those intoxicating Jamaican spices filling the air.  Even though the wind outside is brisk, I am immediately transported to Ocho Rios along the north shore.  Hell, yea, I'm off to a good start. 

I ordered the oxtail 'cause my Yelp buddies suggested it.  Wow.  A very dark gravy added to the wonder of tender meat, with little bits of  gelatin from hours of low-n-slow cooking like Mom did when she had all day to linger in the kitchen.  Rice, beans, plantains, and cabbage . . . each well prepared even though the place is small and the food served humbly  in takeouts. 

My advice?  Come here for your dose of Jamaican cuisine.  Who knows?  They're so close to the airport, you might get an itch and take the next flight to Montego Bay.  Give 'em a whirl!"}
{"text":"Best Jamaican food in the city!!  Best of Oxtail they fall off the bone. And food is fresh great staff! Good price.. I come as much as I can!"}
{"text":"The flavor on the meat is amazing, I just cant get over the bones in the food.  If he could figure out a way to cup up the meat without the bone shards, it would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"Curried goat was fantastic.  Highly recommend!  A dozen other items on the menu looked great as well."}
{"text":"I had a large oxtail meal.  It came with pees, rice, cabbage and fried plantains.  I also ordered a small mac and cheese on the side to try.  My 5 star rating is enough to describe the taste.  What I really liked about this place was the amount of food they served.  I've heard from Jamaican friends that it's rare to find a large amount of oxtail in a meal, but that wasn't the case here.  So much food that I have to take home and eat later.  The price was okay, nothing too special to talk about in terms of money.  I recommend Lawrence Caribbean Restaurant if you're hungry and can eat a lot."}
{"text":"Authentic Jamaican food. Mr Lawerance has brought Jamaica to Charlotte. Definitely try the jerk chicken"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Charlotte for an event and we tried this place.  As another reviewer mentioned, there are only a couple of tables to sit at, but the people are super friendly.  If you want some delicious jerk chicken, look no further."}
{"text":"Ok so based on all the good reviews I decided to give it a try. According to the reviews the oxtail was supposed to be amazing. It was more like I'm amazed that they're still open. I ordered a large oxtail dinner with 2 beef patties. First let's start with my initial impression when I opened the box. I had a ton of rice and very little oxtail. Already I'm feeling disappointed but was hoping the flavor would be so good that I could overlook that. Nope! Again disappointed... The rice was bland and dry. If it wasn't for the gravy from the oxtails it would not have been edible. It tasted like cardboard. Now as far as the oxtails, they had potential to be really good  but they were not seasoned well. With the right amount of seasoning they could have been really good. The larger oxtails were also kinda tough. Lastly, these were the worst beef patties I have ever had. I would definitely not recommend this place. This was really a waste of 20 buck. DON'T DO IT!!"}
{"text":"Was really craving some jamaican food  , so hubby drove me there.  I order jerk chicken, rice n peas, and stew chicken ,rice n peas,  and 2 chicken patties,  the patties is to die for, really tasty not too spicy . Rice and peas had lumps  may be it was from an old batch. Also jerk chicken was very dried n no flavor,  stew chicken was falling apart. I will eat if i really have the crave for it, beside that not at all. Its in the middle of nowhere, just that n a gas station,  dont ho there at night very scary, or during the day by yourself."}
{"text":"I thought paying $10 for the SMALL curry shrimp was for the size of the meal NOT the shrimp. It was a disappointment to get home and see those little things swimming in that watery flavorless curry \"sauce\",  the hunt will continue for authentic delicious Caribbean cuisine. Had expectations a bit higher based on other reviews. Apparently if you're a meat eater you'll be satisfied."}
{"text":"If in Charlotte, may I suggest you make a stop at this small, lil Caribbean joint. Limited seating,kinda cozy. Outside patio looked like it may seat 10-15 people..We were lucky enough to grab a small table inside. Lots of folks coming and going for take out.

The Oxtail! Melts in your mouth! The curry goat was divine. Had just the right amount of spice. The sides, cabbage w/peas and carrots,rice and beans were perfect. Authentic stamp of approval from my sexy Trinidadian companion :) said it reminded him of home. Island boy knows a thing or 2 about cookin.

Parking can be hectic,but nothing unmanageable.(Dont let that discourage you) For what awaits you inside is the real deal, Caribbean Soul Food Heaven! Oh yeah, forgot to mention,they do serve a limited selection of beer.

Very friendly staff, pricing for portions is very reasonable. I can see another visit real soon!

Go get cha some!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Lawrence. I've only been in charlotte for a few months but out of all the Caribbean restaurants I've tried (Mama's Caribbean grill, Island Grocery, Caribbean Hut, Golden Krust) this is my favorite. the oxtails are the best thing on the menu (though i may be biased since its my fav). 
It's a clean restaurant but its very small so i get my food to go. Food is ready within minutes which i really appreciate. in and out within 5 minutes!"}
{"text":"Really liked the restaurant nice, clean, neat beautiful, and I wanted to like the food but it did not have the authentic Jamaican flavor and seasonings I wanted. Jerk chicken was dry and beef patty wasnt good either"}
{"text":"Since my last review of this restaurant, I expressed my dissatisfaction to the owner and he refunded me money back."}
{"text":"My guy showed me this little gem a while back and to be honest I cant believe I haven't written a review yet! I love this place! definitely more of a take out type place but its absolutely perfect for when I want delicious Caribbean food and can take it to the comfort of my couch however if you would like you can eat there they have a few small tables inside and a patio outside with some tables and great music playing. They have all the staples of curried and stewed beef chicken and fish and sides like mac and cheese rice and peas collards and cabbage with of course plantains that you MUST try. I could eat here multiple times a week and I think last week I did if I'm honest. I am more of a veggie plate kinda girl here as I cannot get enough of their delicious sides and definitely make sure that you ask for gravy on your rice and peas its a must.  Everything is very fairly priced and the guys behind the counter are so nice and always happy to see people come in.  Parking is in a small shared lot with a convenience store but Ive never had trouble getting a spot.  I definitely recommend this place for any night of the week and at the moment they are also running a check in special so check it out its delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  The fall of the bone oxtails with lots of gravy was on point.  The cabbage was good and the plantain was very sweet. The beef patty was great as well.  I've lived in Charlotte for over 11 years and miss NYC's variety of authentic Caribbean food.  Lawrence's is worth the trip and gives me a taste of home. It's a bit pricey but on a payday it can certainly hit the spot."}
{"text":"I was on my way home from a business trip and was craving some good authentic Caribbean food which I no longer get since moving from NJ.  But, I found this gem.  I have tried other places in Charlotte, but nothing compares.  Thank you for some good home cooking!  The oxtails, rice, cabbage and plantains were delicious!  The family loved the curry goat and brown stewed chicken.  This is the place to go when you need your Caribbean fix."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp while in town for business, and so glad I went. Very good food and affordable prices. Red Stripe beer too!"}
{"text":"Had the large curry chicken plate which came with cabbage, rice/peas and plantain. Food was fantastic and portion size was large. Would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This the closest to Caribbean food I've had since I left New York. Went for lunch take out.  The gentleman behind the counter was friendly and fast.  I had the oxtails (which were falling of the bone), rice and peas , mixed vegetables, fried plantains and a beef patty.  Everything was seasoned to perfection!  I will definitely put this place in my rotation!"}
{"text":"What a great new lunch spot! While the Jerk chicken wasn't as spicy as my uncle's, it was just as good. Amazing flavor and the portions were superb. I was able to eat the leftovers for another full meal! The gentleman at the counter suggested that I try the cream soda and I am glad I did. I was worried that it would be too sweet, but it was a really good complement to the meal. The sides were tasty as well. My friend said her beef patty was great. I'm mad I didn't get one on my first time, but I'll make sure to not make that mistake again! 

The parking was kind of confusing for us because the gate looked closed, so we turned around and parked on the other side using the next door store's parking lot to get to their lower lot. Trust me, it's worth figuring out how to get in here!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Second time eating here and food is awesome. Huge portions. Great variety of Caribbean food. The jerk sauce is super spicy and amazing!! Place is  small but they have some seating inside and a few tables outside. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This spot is amazing. The owner definitely cooks and serves his food with love. In NY you can find a good Jamaican spot all over but down south it's quite difficult to get authentic Jamaican food and experience. If your looking for good food this is a great place to go!"}
{"text":"Curry chicken....sooooooooo good. Me and my husband both enjoyed our meals. Very affordable and Lawrence is so sweet. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I had a craving for jerk chicken so I tapped on my trusty yelp app  and came across this cozy little place. If you blink you'll drive right by it. 
 The  dining room only has about four tables but there is a patio outside if you prefer al fresco.
 I ordered a beef patty and the jerk chicken dinner. Total around $14. 
The beef patty was the best I had in years. Enough spice to make you say \"whoa\" thinking it may be too spicy, but it never gets to a painful point. Perfect for me. 
The jerk chicken dinner I got was small size, since this was my first go round with this business. It's a really generous portion and the food was delicious. Please support this lovely local business."}
{"text":"Sorry to say I have to stick to the oxtail only. Today I got the fish and fries....NASTY. The fish was not seasoned and was soggy. Never again."}
{"text":"The food was delicious/amazing! My husband is from Trinidad and raved about the curry goat.I had the stew chicken and loved it The portions are more than enough and if you are a hearty eater they sell sides of meat and anything else you may want. Our trip to Lawrence Caribbean Restaurant takes 25 minutes but it's worth it. We will return often."}
{"text":"As someone who tries to checkout every Caribbean place in the area I really like this one. Great price. Great selection and service. Small no thrills location with a little inside and outside seating."}
{"text":"Hidden gem alert, folks! Pass through downtown on I-277 and get on 77-South. I know, I know. I hate 77, too. But, don't fret. You won't be on it long. Exit almost immediately to West Blvd. and settle in for a couple miles. After 5-minutes or so, watch for Lawrence Caribbean to appear on your left. It's a colorful, little hut that will immediately make you wish you were on an island somewhere. 

Once inside, you order at the window and receive your food packed to go. If you want to stay and eat, you can either sit at one of the few tables inside or outside on the patio, where there are a few more seats. Service was very fast and friendly. 

I went with the small jerk chicken (white meat), with cabbage, collard greens, and plantains. Everything was delicious! The collards had some spice to them and the cabbage was well seasoned. The jerk chicken was moist and the sauce that accompanied it was fresh and spicy. The real star of the meal were those plantains though... Man, I could eat those plantains every day, for breakfast, lunch and dinner! 

They had a sign on the door advertising delivery through Postmates. I have a sneaking suspicion lots of deliveries from Lawrence are in my future!"}
{"text":"Quick service! It was good food a little spicy for me. Love that you can check in and get 10% off"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant for the first time and I doubt it will be my last! Very friendly service & good authentic Jamaican food. I throughly enjoyed my beef patty along with my oxtail dinner entree. The oxtail was soft, tender, and flavorful (I think there was a hint of curry flavor). Check out this restaurant for delicious Caribbean food!"}
{"text":"This place has wonderful Caribbean home cooking. I had the Ox tail with rice and peas, it was fall off the bone tender with great flavor."}
{"text":"This place...this food is the absolute best for carribean cuisine. Friendly staff and great food."}
{"text":"The best Jamaican spots are the smallest with big favour, curry goat,  rice peas, everything great, try a bottle of Ting"}
{"text":"Awesome authentic place!!! Curry chicken, jerk chicken, beef or chicken patties ... with rice and cabbage and plantains! Yum  if you're looking for your Caribbean fix, look no further"}
{"text":"Jerk chicken.....amazing! I was so glad that I followed Yelp and tried this place before leaving Charlotte. The staff was so welcoming and friendly. I did get dark meat chicken which has bones but the flavor would not be there without it! Rice and beans are great but even better with the 'gravy' on them. The cabbage was really good and the plantains were perfect! Trust me....don't miss this very authentic Jamaican experience! You will be glad you tried it!"}
{"text":"Finally found a Caribbean restaurant with GREAT food. The Brown Stew Chicken was perfect. Worth the effort to find the place."}
{"text":"My parents are West Indian and I'm from NY so I know good Caribbean food. This is the only place in Charlotte I've tried and they did good. The oxtail isn't the best but the curry goat roti is the best curry goat I've ever had."}
{"text":"The food is awesome! I was only passing through town and found this gem...authentic and down right friendly staff!  A very intimate restaurant with no large tables but a great place nonetheless....I highly recommend the curry shrimp!"}
{"text":"The people were nice except this is not Jamaican food!!!!! We ordered the jerk chicken and the brown stew chicken.  The brown stew chicken was in a light creamy sauce... which is not how it's supposed to be.  Authentic brown stew chicken has a thick dark gravy.  The jerk chicken was not bad but not good either .... the rice and peas lack flavor ... I'm sorry the people giving good reviews have never had really Jamaican food before."}
{"text":"Definitely authentic and delicious. My coworker wasn't impressed but I've eaten many home-cooked jamaican meals and this was just like eating them . 

Real jerk chicken seasoned right shouldn't require a ton of gravy or sauce to achieve that carribean flare, Lawrence's delivered on keeping it simple and yummy . The prices were a bit steep , especially for lunch , $15 ... ehhhh I won't be visiting here often , but if I'm truly craving more then this will be my spot . Service was fast  & friendly, , the location a little weird for parking, I passed the entrance and had to do a u turn. I'm not sure if the patties are made fresh or frozen , but they looked good . I gotta try the oxtails next time , I hear they are the must try here . All in all , if you're looking for home cooked food with that island love , this is your spot ."}
{"text":"I haven't been to the location physically but I had an oxtail plate with rice and peas & Mac & Cheese delivered via Postmates. My food was delicious and it's hard to find authentic Jamaican food in Charlotte...I can't wait to visit in person. I've heard great things about the owner, Mr. Lawrence."}
{"text":"Had curried goat.  It was awesome!

Not much room for sitting and you have to eat from takeout instead of real plates and flatware, but can't argue with the taste."}
{"text":"Really great authentic food. Good quality and nice staff. I had the oxtail which was awesome! I'll definitely be back to try the ackee!"}
{"text":"If you are Trini looking for good Roti don't come here. They do not make Roti like the trinis. I'm from NY and my family is from Trinidad so I know what good Roti taste like. If you want good Roti go to Island Grocery instead. I will say their Jamaican food is on point. I love their oxtail and rice and peas it is very comparable to NY's standards. Their jerk chicken with white meat was dry but not bad."}
{"text":"Went here one time. I will never go again. The chicken was incredibly undercooked and red on the inside (I had stew chicken). The rice and the cabbage were dry and lacked flavor. I'm from the north and I know what good, and pretty authentic Caribbean food tastes like. This just wasn't it at all."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed like I thought I would be. I guess I had high hopes for this place.. I ordered the curry chicken with rice and peas and yams. 

Well for starters I wish they would have put the yams in a separate container because the curry sauce fell all over it.  

Curry chicken- it was okay but there was so many bone fragments, every bite i took i was pulling a fragment or a bone out 

Rice&peas- dry and bland

Yams- bland but cooked right"}
{"text":"This place is a breath of fresh air in the food desert of West Blvd. The portions are huge: the jerk chicken + rice + cabbage plate, for example, will easily lasts for two meals and a snack. There is obvious pride in this establishment, and that translates through the warm and welcoming interactions with the owner and staff. The food is perfect. A+"}
{"text":"It's ALL good! The beef stew, the oxtail, the jerk chicken, the chicken roti, the curry goat, etc. If you like it hot, Jamaican scotch bonnet level hot, ask Chef Lawrence for his special hot sauce."}
{"text":"We ordered from this restaurant via Postmates on Friday night. The delivery was fast and friendly. 

We enjoyed the food, the portions were hearty and the taste was flavorful. The prices for entrees range from $10-15 and come with a free drink. 

All the authentic flavors you'd expect from Caribbean food at reasonable prices. I cannot speak to the quality of service since we ordered via the app but the food was prepared quickly and arrived hot and fresh. 

I'd definitely return when I'm back in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Saw the restaurant had finally opened, after watching the remodeling going on for a while, driving home from work each day.  Was excited when my schedule gave me a chance to stop in.

Walked in -aroma from the kitchen was like a familiar, exotic friend.  So comforting, and special.

Service was good, attentive.  What I liked was he told me what they had ready to go, first.  And he meant it.  That food was ready in 2 minutes!  I totally would have waited for something that needed fresh cooked.  I get it.  Stews, oxtail, and longer cooking items, you want that flavor cooked in.  so, they're ready to go.  Wings, fish, etc. you want fresh and hot.  It all works for me.

Ordered the large oxtail dinner.  There must have been 2 pounds of food in that take-out container!  The rice, oh that rice!  I could literally have that rice, as my only food, the rest of my life, and be content.  OMG it was soo good. flavor, texture, volume!!  spiced perfectly, such good balance!

The oxtail was magnificent.  Tender, toothsome, brilliant!  Loved it, and a good amount!

Had cabbage, and mac 'n' cheese as well.  Both good sides.

I will be going back tonight to order jerk chicken, and maybe one or more of their other selections, to share with family.  :)

(Enter the driveway in front of the small grocery mart, then turn to the left, toward the restaurant, to park.)"}
{"text":"My friend, who is from Jamaica, took me here so I could experience authentic \"Ja\" food. It was AMAZING! I had the jerk chicken with beans & rice and cabbage.  My friend ordered some kind of plate that had a bunch of things in it...chicken in a brown gravy, white yams, ackee & saltfish, a dumpling and boiled green bananas. My friend let me try his food so I could taste everything.  Everything had so much flavor and was made with care. They also make many Jamaican beverages so be sure to try these too. Some with alcohol & some without. I'm definately going to be going back very soon."}
{"text":"Some of the hottest jerk chicken I have every had. Very tasty. I think that people not used to very hot food would have a hard time with this. I eat extremely hot food and it affected me a lot worse then I expected. The rice with the jerk chicken is some of the best Rice I have every eaten in my life. The chicken curry is to die for also. Would eat this food again and again."}
