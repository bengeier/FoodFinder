{"text":"Good place, good value. Apparently the curry dishes are the ones to get, but everyone in our group enjoyed their dishes. 

I'll be back for another visit soon."}
{"text":"How do you come off a major renovation with no air conditioning, no fridge to store cold beverages, and no pad Thai. Holy shit."}
{"text":"Great food, cozy atmosphere for a date, but a little slow on the service. They do loads of takeout, so maybe it'd be faster for ordering in.

Try the green curry, pad thai (very authentic), and any soup."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite Thai spots! Service is always friendly and food is always exceptionally delicious! My favorite is their Vegetarian appetizer sample plate. So much delicious food for $11 and their coconut chicken soup is dreamy!"}
{"text":"Is this place even open any more? Every time I call there's no answer. Is voicemail really that complicated in 2015?"}
{"text":"Walked past this place and went in as I get random food cravings.

Place is nice and cosy, each table on the side has these annoying bamboo shoots wrapped in xmas lights protruding from the walls. 

On walking in the lady at the counter was on the phone, taking an order of some sort but definitely not a personal conversation. So I seated myself as there was plenty of tables to choose from. 

I was so preoccupied with reading the soccer results on my phone that it was 10 minutes before I thought \"where's the menu\", so I turned around and she was still on the phone at which point I got up and asked her to hand me a menu.

So I ordered a beef Thai red curry, and it came out in less than 10 minutes and it looked great. 
The plates on the table are way to small to try and pour the rice and the curry at once. I made a total mess trying to do so and lost much of the curry sauce to the table cloth.  

The food itself was great, reasonably priced although I imagine there are cheaper places around this area. 

Get bigger plates on the table and that would solve one problem :)"}
{"text":"The food is pretty decent and it's cheaper than most places around here. I usually enjoy it, but was disappointed that the thing I was just chewing on turned out to be a staple. I am quite sure I did not ask for any staples in my food, and am glad I noticed it before it ripped apart my mouth or I swallowed it. Next time I would ask for it without staples, but there probably won't be a next time."}
{"text":"Kind of average tasting, but still pretty good.

Really my only problem with them is they're not open on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"I should also mention that they're a bit fuzzy about gluten content, so don't bring your celiac friends.  The place just south on Vaughan knows their gluten, though I don't prefer their food."}
{"text":"The pad Thai was delicious, and the price was right. Delivery was fast too. Can't wait to try the other offerings."}
{"text":"Got dinner delivered from this place once via Just-Eat, and boy, it was the worst Thai food I ever had! I was sick and wanted some nice Tom kha kai (spicy coconut-chicken soup), and it was the blandest thing I have ever eaten. It was as though they grabbed a can of coconut milk and threw in some sliced white button mushrooms and called it a day. Bleech. Never again! Now we pick up from Khmer on the other side of Oakwood, and it's awesome."}
{"text":"Had delivery from here twice now.

The good:
Bold flavours in the Pad Thai and Cashew Nut Chicken.
Great dinner for 2 special.

The bad:
Boring spring rolls.

Overall:
It's our new favourite Thai delivery."}
