{"text":"Walked in to try the new place out. Had to leave immediately because of the sewer smell."}
{"text":"Place is on point! Great food, great service!  Blue Cave is an awesome local pub, music and chill hang out patio!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst customer service I've ever seen. We walked in and NO ONE greeted us for 10 minutes. We actually called them from the entrance and no one answered!  There was only 6 people in the place. Turns out the chef was talking to a couple sitting in a booth and did not even acknowledge us until I asked him if the place was closed for a private party. He said no but he could help us. I asked if he saw us and he said yes but he was busy talking. We walked out and you probably will to. If you want be treated like crap, come here. ZERO STARS."}
