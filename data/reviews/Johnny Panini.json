{"text":"We both were impressed with the portions and the flavors.  The atmosphere is modern and clean.  But the icing on the proverbial cake.. Amazing staff!!!  They actually really wanted to make sure we were happy! 

We will be back."}
{"text":"Good Veal sandwich with all the usual toppings. Big sandwich too so even though this will set you back about $10 with a pop it will definitely fill you up."}
{"text":"Working around the area, there are many choices to dine in for lunch, and Johnny Panini is one of them. My coworkers and I usually go out for either Pizza, Chinese, or the traditional Tim Hortons, Wendys, etc. 

However, I finally took decision that we should try out Johnny Panini for lunch. 

Just a heads up, that I think because of renovation, they have taken down their display sign, so spotting the place could be difficult. However, if you can smell the tasty dishes coming from the area, then you know you are in the right place. 

We went in around 12:45PM and placed our orders. My coworker ordered a chicken panini, and I myself ordered a chicken panini with medium spice, along with mushrooms and sweet peppers. We placed the order to go, provided our names and sat down waiting for it. 

Do note that it is a busy place, so do expect the wait. We ended up waiting for around 20 minutes, and our names were called. The front cashier apologized for the delay, and my coworker and I hoped that it was well worth the wait. After opening up the wrapping, the size of the kaiser bun I think was perfect, and it smelt great. The chicken was cooked/grilled perfectly, and I think the chicken was lightly dusted in bread crumbs to make it crispy so to speak. The spice was perfect along with their sauce, and the toppings were perfect. I can definitely attest to the excellent quality and it was well worth the wait. It was pretty filling too. 

However, as with any place I review, there's always either a star or more docked off. In this case, they lost a star because of the following:

1) The service could be slightly \"quicker\", and not having their customers to wait. There was one customer who ordered after us, and had received their order before mine. 

2) I am not sure if they are renovating the place or not, but the smell of the grill was too off putting. At one point, my coworker and I could not breathe and take in the smell. As a result of that, our clothes are lingering with the charred/grill smell, and even on our hair. Perhaps they could have a proper ventilation system. There was even a light trace of the smoke that comes from the grill inside the dining area. 

3) There could be another vegetarian option? They do have the eggplant parm sandwich, but having one with vegetables would be great. This is something that I like another place in Mississauga called On a Bun. I am sure they will eventually have more vegetarian options. 

Overall it was definitely worth it, but if they can improve on the above three, then definitely they are worth the 5 stars. I look forward to trying out their pasta dishes."}
