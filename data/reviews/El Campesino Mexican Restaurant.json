{"text":"Good stuff.  The best chips and salsa. Great cheese dip too.The double steak and chicken quesadilla is fantastic."}
{"text":"This place and its sister location in Kent fry up my favorite cheap-ass Mexican food in the entire NEO area. The locations are essentially interchangeable, but today I'm giving the nod to the Streetsboro place because it's really obvious to everyone who sets foot inside it that the building used to be a McDonald's, and sometimes, SHIT GETS REAL. Like, this one time, I heard a kid screaming from the bathroom because, as he would later claim, an apparition of a creepy man dressed as a clown appeared in the bathroom mirror and lunged at him while he was washing his hands.*  Other than that, this place is aces. Yes, it's the typical combo platter Mexican joint with about fifty thousand menu items that are all inherently the same basic thing, but they just do it much better than most of the other places. (Which says a lot coming from me, given the fact that cheap Mexican food is my favorite food group.) And cripes, man, is it cheap -- cheap enough that you don't have to feel guilty about springing for one of their tasty margaritas.  That's all. Thank you Yelp! and Internet for the free speech.  *Editor's Note: The author of this review is totally joking about that stuff with the creepy ghost clown. Honest. This place is very nice and family friendly, unlike the Home Depot. Seriously, can I have one trip to the Home Depot where I don't have to see the employees engaging in horrifying occult rituals?**  **A Different Editor's Note: The editor of this review is totally joking about the Home Depot. This was actually meant to be a thinly veiled jab at Lowe's.  (This is the point in the review where you vote it up for being 'Useful')"}
{"text":"For Mexican in northeast Ohio, it doesn't get much better than El Campos. Try the quesadillas, can't be beat. Be ready to wait for a table if you're going on a Friday or Saturday night.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went there last night and the restaurant did not have heat.  We asked them to turn it up and they said it was broken.  Multiple customers started to complain.  It was so cold in there we had to wear gloves to eat. When we asked what they were going to do to compensate us they said nothing.  Clearly they don't care about customers...they only want your money."}
{"text":"good authentic Mexican food at reasonable prices with very pleasant staff and a nice location. we eat there often."}
{"text":"Came here for cinco de mayo this year. My second time at this location and had a great experience both times. The chips were hot and fresh and the salsa had just enough of a kick. Pitcher of margaritas were great and well priced. The fajitas were fantastic and a nice sized portion for the price. Service was very impressive considering the amount of business for the Mexican holiday. Overall great time, good food, awesome value. Will be returning."}
{"text":"I live in Florida now, but anytime I am back home in Ohio, this is the best Mexican food around. Everything is made fresh, I love the chips and salsa, and it's just got a great, homey feel to it. There is lots of good Mexican food in Florida, but I still crave Streetsboro El Campesino quite frequently"}
{"text":"I'm from southern cal. I know good Mexican food. This is good. Fajitas were good. Quick and good price."}
{"text":"The food is always quick and the staff is friendly. My boys love eating the fresh chips and salsa. They also love the cheese sauce."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Never had a bad meal and cost is reasonable.  Chicken enchiladas are amazing and good size portions."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food at great prices and very quick and friendly. My number one choice in Streetsboro."}
{"text":"This is a quaint Mexican restaurant with good food, good service and very reasonable prices. I stop here for lunch every now and again and have never experienced a bad meal."}
{"text":"Great food and the homemade sangria is to die for. Delish tacos, flautas, tamales. Stopped here for dinner on an overnight stay in town on the way to Chicago. Made the drive worthwhile!!  If you are traveling on I80 in Ohio, make this a must stop!"}
{"text":"Great for the family! Great Food at Great Prices!  We go here at least once a month.  I highly recommend due to the value!"}
{"text":"Had a late lunch today. The lunch included two shrimp soft tacos and two beef enchiladas. The food was great and the restaurant was not too crowded. The staff checked on me often and I appreciated it. I will become a repeat customer."}
{"text":"We've been going there for almost 12 years. They recently built an outside patio. This is probably the place that is most authentic for being a Mexican restaurant. People are friendly, food is good, and service is lightning fast."}
{"text":"A great Mexican restaurant with good prices. El Camps never lets you down. Chips are always fresh, meals come out quickly (our wait tonight averaged 4 minutes), and the margaritas are pretty standard. A Stow gem."}
{"text":"Very unpretentious place with AWESOME food and friendly service. The selection of menu items is extensive, and the food is always served promptly, fresh and HOT. Meat and vegetables are high quality - This is our favorite Mexican restaurant. We have eaten here regularly for for many years .. and it's a the first place we think of when we want Mexican."}
{"text":"The Streetsboro El Campesino remains one of the best Mexican restaurants in Ohio. The food is always fresh, piping hot, and service is top notch. Our Families favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"I liked this place but I also was not as impressed as I could have been. The salsa was very good and liquidity as i fancy but in the end I thought that the portions were okay for the price and we all got the water but it was not refilled once, maybe they did not like that we all good waters, unsure. On the whole I got two steak burritos which were very good not amazing but still very good makes me sleep happy."}
{"text":"Average Mexican restaurant if you are craving it, your craving will be met but not much more. Service is hot or cold. Depends on who you get. They struggle with drink refills. They actually seem to handle big parties better than a couple. They have always been pretty nice."}
{"text":"Very inexpensive. A lot of good food at a great price. I always enjoy coming here. Owner is very hands on and makes sure everything is right!"}
{"text":"A great little Mexican restaurant.  As soon as we walked in the door we were greeted with smiles and a very friendly staff.  I also noted that the restaurant was very clean and well maintained.  The salsa and chips were delicious and were quickly refilled when we ran low.  I really enjoyed the food as well, large portions at good prices.   Definitely a place I would visit again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Chips were great. Queso Dip with Chorizo watery. Tamal too starchy. Chile Rellenos passable, pepper undercooked.   Gold Margaritas good, not great.  About whatI would expect in Streetsboro. :)"}
{"text":"I'd been going past this place for years, thinking it was just a bar. One day at work a young coworker mentioned liking the food at one of their locations,so when I was passing one at dinner time I stopped in. The food was great! Tonight I am trying the Streetsboro location, and it's just as good. I will be back. This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"This is great Mexican food - great value - very good service 2 out of 3 times.  I love their quesadillas.  The atmosphere is a little scary, but not too bad.  They are super fast, too."}
{"text":"We always enjoy dinner here. Great quesadillas, burritos and Chile rellenos! We honestly think it the best Mexican food in the area, and eat here frequently. Food is good, service is fast, and portions are good sized. It's also nice that my picky daughter and my vegetarian daughter can both eat here easily."}
{"text":"Seeking out some good Mexican food I found El Campesino on Yelp and took a chance.  The exterior was dark, blinds pulled shut and not much lighting in the parking lot.  I took a chance and ventured inside.  The mood was lively with multiple families and couples enjoying what appeared to be good food and drink.  I ordered a Negra Modelo and the Seafood Burrito special.  The drink and food came out relatively quick and the server checked back with me several times.  The food was good.  I've had better, but for the area it was pretty darn good.  The salsa was thick and had a roundhouse kick to it.  The burrito was done just right with enough shrimp and crab meat to keep me entertained.  The night ended well and I signed up for their belly rewards club.  If I come back 4 more times I get a free dessert.  I can see myself enjoying that fried ice cream pretty soon."}
{"text":"A GREAT Mexcan Restaurant!  Very attentive staff .....a basket of chips and salsa arrive at your table the minute you are seated. Meals come out quickly....and hot.  My fajitas were steaming for a long time. Menu selection is overwhelming and prices are very reasonable.   All the employees are friendly and make you feel like family. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Your El Campesino dining experience will ALWAYS be consistent... And honestly, I'd rather have consistent than knock-my-socks-off dining experience for a place that I frequent.  My husband and I will get out of here for $20-25 depending on tip.  We come here about once a week in the evening while my husband is on his lunch break.  We've had issues with Bob Evans, Denny's and Applebee's being too slow to serve us within the hour lunch break so El Campesino's is perfect.  They know us well and they're always friendly and prompt.  The food is tasty and I always leave pleased.  They have an extensive menu that you're certain to find something.  This summer they also opened up a new patio which has been busy every day I've seen!"}
{"text":"First timer, food was ok-rice had no flavor, dessert was very good.  Served dessert with dinner plates still on table, barely had room to eat-had to ask for them to be taken away and for refills-all cups were empty.  Fried ice cream, cheesecake and sopapillas were perfect and fair priced! Will be back for the sweets for sure.  Food server was very friendly and talked with kids, trying out Spanish class words."}
{"text":"For Mexican food it wasn't very good. Coming from California I feel as though maybe my standards are too high. The service was good but the food was more like Americanized Mexican fast food than authentic quality Mexican food."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic.  We were seated quickly and a waiter took our order for drinks.  Our food was served promptly and was very good.  I had ordered the \"fire burrito\" was very good.  The portion size was about average with other Mexican food restaurants in the area.  Price was fair.   WiFi was advertised but I did not check into further into it."}
{"text":"Here's the thing. You just can't find great authentic Mexican food in Ohio.  We're from Colorado and California where finding Mexican deliciousness is much easier.  But when you're stuck here, El Campesino is a pretty darn good option.  It's run mostly by a super friendly staff of Mexicans and the \"so horrible it's awesome\" decor makes you feel like you've stepped out of plain Ohio into some place a bit closer to the boarder.  This place just makes me happy.   It is the ONLY place I've found in Ohio that when it says \"spicy\" it actually is (thank you Fire Burrito).  And when they offer you the Large Beer option, look out, cuz it's wonderfully HUGE and cheap!  The margaritas aren't half bad either.  But the best best part is that we can eat here as a whole family pretty inexpensively. Bonus!  Don't expect a knock your socks off meal.  But for what it is and trying to be it's a great place to get your taco fix.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my evening at the bar !! Luved it !! Mr Miquel was very personable and took great care of me and my guest !! Ms. Blanca was amazing and made the bar experience a very memorable one !! The food was excellent !! Luved it !! Will highly recommend the place !! Thx  DR MD"}
{"text":"We were in the area for the Twins Fest and found this location near where we were staying. What a find! Our kids had soft shell tacos. My DH had the seafood burrito special and I had the special burrito from the menu. SO delicious, fresh and flavorful. I'd eat that burrito (with pork and refried beans and queso blanco) again today! The homemade sangria was wonderful as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Perfectly adequate Mexican food. Won't wow you, but won't disappoint either. The best thing here is the beef tip chili. I get that with a soft shell beef taco, makes for a decent lunch."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Great food, good prices, delicious  Margaritas with plenty of alcohol;)  Very friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic food with a great lively atmosphere. Will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Large portions and excellently cooked. We had Fajitas, soup,and quesadillas for the kids. The soup and fajitas were to die for. The staff was very very friendly. they were nice to our kids and welcomed us even though we came in at 9pm. We left with as much as we ate! Really big portions in my opinion. We would definitely recommend and would return."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican Restaurant in the area. Like, seriously.   On the occasion that this place is incredibly busy, the service can be a bit spotty, but the food more than makes up for that. The portions are large and filling, the margaritas are heavy-handed (so you don't feel like you're spending money on lime water lol), and the rice and refried beans are a delicious side dish to any entree you decide on.   If you're looking for some delicious dip for your chips, especially if you're not really feeling salsa and you love your cheese, get the chorizo con queso. It's a game changer in the terms of a great appetizer! It makes the wait for your main dish seem like a friggin party.   I personally get a burrito when I go, which comes with delicious and filling rice and refried beans! I have also enjoyed the fajita and guacamole before as well!"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican, especially for the area. I think you do have to know what to order... I had co-workers raving about it and my first couple experiences were nothing to brag about. The next few times I have tried their daily specials or \"specialties\" from the menu and had much much better experiences!"}
{"text":"El Compesino, mi amor!! I am seriously IN LOVE WITH YOU. From your convenient location to your open and spacious patio.....my heart is yours. You smell like my abuela's kitchen and have just as much alcohol as she did too. Wait, does my abuela work here?   I am a harsh critic of Mexican restaurants. Having grown up in the Latino hood, I have had me some really good food. El Compesino really hits the mark in many areas. They took over an old Wendy's location and really made it feel like a taqueria. Simple and functional design with plenty of seating. But really, who comes to a Mexican restaurant for the decor?  Their chips are fresh and their salsa is FANTASTIC. If you are a big old wimp? when it comes to ?spice, you may want not take huge scoops. I am a spice whore....and this salsa rocks my socks. Just enough spice to make it worth my while. Flavorful with chunky tomatoes and fresh ingredients.   I ordered the queso causa con chorizo to go with my chips. Dear Lord, I think I got a chubby. This queso has to seriously be one of the very best I have EVER had. Creamy, thick and a good amount of flavorful chorizo. You will not stop until it is ALL GONE....and then you will order another one just because LOL  Their margarita pitcher special is where it is at. Simply put, one glass is NOT enough. They make a fantastic margarita?.   Their fajita platter is the bomb diggity. I love the mix of veggies they use, their beans are flavorful and cooked perfectly and their rice is fantastic. The guac is simple and effective....great on the corn tortillas I asked to come with my fajita plate. Plenty of food for two as well.  The patio here is spacious with plenty of seating. I love the location of this place too....super convenient to get to. I have been here many times and continue to go back for more!"}
{"text":"My family and I have routinely visited the Canton and Streetsboro locations for years and the food and service are consistently excellent every time.  I would highly recommend them to anyone, and like to thank the staff and management for our good times there."}
{"text":"Ugly building, excellent food. Margaritas were house mix, so good, but not the best ever. Regardless, food is worth it. Fajitas are great and food was hot. Good service too."}
{"text":"The good:  margaritas were fantastic.   Not so good:   With all the great Yelp reviews, I was expecting it to be so much better.  Found the food to be at best average....Nothing to rave home about.  But then again, I'm comparing it to one of my favorite restaurants in West Palm Beach which is frickin awesome."}
{"text":"Had fire burrito for lunch. If you like spicy, this is for you, may be too hot for some. Good food and quick service over lunch break."}
{"text":"Friendly service, hot delicious and fresh Made salsa, frijoles and quesadilla and verrrry reasonable.  The chicken pepper and onions were still steaming on the flat iron."}
{"text":"Truly a superlative dining experience, but not the superlatives one usually associates with food. I went here with extremely low expectations, but they were not met.  Salsa tasted like marinara sauce. Asked for hotter salsa. Waiter encouraged me to mix in some of the hot sauce condiments, which were next to the ketchup--not an item one one usually expects to encounter at a Mexican restaurant. Then again, possibly a holdover from the restaurants patently obvious recent past as a McDonald's.   My friend's meal came nearly 15 minutes before my elementary school cafeteria quality mole enchiladas arrived. The tortillas had the consistency of rubber and the flavor of Bisquick pancakes. The mole sauce was not naturally occurring on this planet. I doused hot sauce all over the dish, but no amount could make this bad boy taste edible. I almost considered resorting to the ketchup.  At some point, any bad restaurant experience crosses the threshold from gastronomy to hilarity. So, with an towards additional yelp fodder, my friend and I ordered the fried ice cream. The only thing fried about it was the taco salad bowl the scoop of ice cream inhabited. The scoop-o-ice-cream was coated in stale cornflakes and marinated in whipped cream and caramel sauce. I managed two bites.  If you find yourself looking for food in Streetsboro, I don't know what to tell you. Keep driving."}
{"text":"You'll always leave satisfied after dining at this place. One of my favorite Mexican restaurants and the food is always fresh & delicious!   Must try the Fajita Quesadilla... It's huge & delicious with a ton of vegges and meat.   They give you a tequila shot for your birthday. Woo!   Watch with peanut/nut allergies... My brother had an allergic reaction after visiting once."}
{"text":"Our first time here and the salsa had some heat finally. Every Mexican restaurant I've been to around here I have to add hot sauce. I got the special burrito and the beef tips were tender and delicious. My husband got the chicken fajita bowl and he's crazy picky, but he really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and have never had a bad meal! Service is good and food always comes out quick and hot! They have a nice little patio too!"}
{"text":"This is a very good restaurant if you like authentic Mexican food (not that Taco Bell garbage). I usually get a chicken  quesadilla and it is HUGE. The chips and salsa are very good, and you can ask for a side of cheese dip which is also quite delicious. I hear they have great margaritas too! Every time I have been to this location the location has been speedy and all of the servers have been extremely nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Atmosphere needs some work.  Very old style Mexican look.  Kinda looks dingy and ill kept.  Service was a bit slow, but they were very busy with full tables. I wish that the server would have let me know that my food already came with Lettuce and guacamole so that I didn't ask for double.  My fiance had the same problem, he ordered sour cream because he didn't know it came with the meal.  Food was very basic Mexican.  It didn't make me ill, but it had no originality either. Tasted pretty fresh, so that's better then many of these little restaurants.  Probably not somewhere I would go back to unless the group I was in really wanted to go there."}
{"text":"My family loves El Campesino. The food taste great and the plate's always full. The salsa is my favorite starter along with the melted cheese. I would recommend the Pollo Con Crema to anyone. The one thing that wins me over every time, is the manager and staff treat their customers like family."}
{"text":"horrible! Noisy, food was bland and WAY over priced.Absolutely do not waste your money here. Like a Mexican eat n park, but worse!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but there was a large chicken bone in my taco salad that I bit right into. I told the waiter and he didn't seem to care much. I usually go to the one in stow, that one I give 5 stars to."}
{"text":"After the 10-hour drive, my shoe might have tasted good...but we were in the mood for Mexican food close to our Streetsboro hotel, and Yelp directed us here!  Big basket of complimentary chips and tasty salsa, and cheap beer for starters (woo-hoo for cheap beer after a long day on the road!!). Service was great, food was amazingly FAST and decent.  Ordered the a la carte shredded beef burrito ($3.95) and a soft chicken taco ($1.85)... hubby chose the deluxe burrito plate ($7.25 for one chicken and one ground beef burrito topped with lettuce, sour cream, tomatoes...) we both liked the chicken much better than the beef."}
{"text":"Everything was very fresh. The guacamole salad was unique and delicious. The waitress was attentive and upbeat. The owner came to our table to greet us and chatted with my wife in Spanish.  My wife recommends the chicken soup. It had an excellent flavor and was very fresh."}
{"text":"I'm moving into a new apartment, and I was hungry and love Mexican food. I stopped in to get a quick meal since I hadn't eaten anything all day. The food was good when I got it but a few hours later I was sick, and a day later I'm still sick. Probably won't be going back after this experience."}
