{"text":"Went for AYCE lunch and was not disappointed. Menu is fairly large and at $14 is definitely good value. Place is always clean and the service was pretty decent for a busy lunch period. One of the regular places I frequent for AYCE sushi, the only drawback is that the portions are rarely the same sometimes there will be too little and sometimes there will be too much."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for lunch.  For the price, food was pretty good.  We liked the sushi and the variety of the options.   Servers were fine, not sure why others complain so much."}
{"text":"Ok, this place gets 4 star for the price.
I didn't get sick eating their food, so that's also good...

I was not happy with the taste of sushi. It's not the fish but the rice, they do not flavor the sushi rice. It has to be flavored with vinegar/salt/sugar. You are not serving sushi without flavoring the rice as sushi rice!!!! This does not add much cost, so please, please make this change to the rice and I can change the rating to 4 star. The fish is fine. Kitchen food is good, too. (for the price) 
If the rice is properly flavored as sushi rice, it will taste sooo much better.

Our table was close to the sushi chefs (chefs??) and some of them were talking so loudly with each other and with the server girls. They all seem to speak Chinese. 

I want to like this place since I think they do a fairly good job offering cheap sushi to the cheap crowd, but as I mentioned, since they don't flavor the rice as it should, their sushi is not tasting like sushi."}
{"text":"I've been to ajisai twice.  I guess it's my fault for coming back because I totally forgot about my experience the first time.  The main reason that I came back is that we live less than 5 min. away from this sushi place.

I should have looked at YELP before I ordered takeout today.

The first time I went, we dined in.  I will not comment further on that experience as I do not recall it fully.

Today, we had a party at home and I was in a rush to get an order together so I put an online order in for Aji sai.  Price was ok for a party tray - about on average.  No tip gouging as it was pick up only.

However, the food was disappointing.  The sashimi/fish was obviously not fresh,dried and a little waxy.  Portion/slices were small and though the party tray was the right size; the quality was lacking.

It could be worse, we still had a good evening and no one got sick so that's good.

But, I personally wouldn't go back.  

In the same plaza, there's an excellent Korean noodle house, excellent chinese restaurant and a franchised wild wings if you are hungry and looking for local alternatives."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Aji Sai last weekend for lunch. They renovated their FOTH and it looks pretty decent. They also printed new menus since the last time we were there. We've always enjoyed coming to this place in the past, but we had a different experience this time.

Food:
- Their wakame salad (a cooked seaweed salad) is tasty. 
- Their fish does not taste fresh and has a mushy texture
- Their rolls have very very little flavour (the spicy salmon rolls has NO taste. It's not even a bit spicy).
- They do not have shrimp tempura during lunch service (whereas Sushi on 7, Maison du Japon, Yang's Kitchen all do)
- Soft drinks are not included in the price (whereas again, the other AYCE restaurants nearby do)

Service:
- Servers are indifferent-- I don't mind, as long as you bring the food
- Servers don't bring food. I think this is the problem. It's happened more than once. They bring the first round quickly, but the second round either takes forever, or does not come AT ALL. We waited 30 minutes for the second round orders, and finally gave up because we got full from sitting and waiting. When we told the manager to cancel or order and to just give us the bill, he looked annoyed and asked us what we ordered, and when told that we don't want it anymore and just the bill, he walked off w/o saying anything. Had to ask for the bill a second time. Hmm.

I'm a low maint. kind of guy. I ain't rich, I don't go to high class restaurants, I don't care about decor-- I just don't like getting shafted.

By the way, it definitely is a popular and busy restaurant. But look around you when you go.. you'll see that going to Aji Sai for Japanese food is kind of like going to Mandarin for Chinese..."}
{"text":"Despite some of negative reviews for this place, i personally felt it was decent for an all you can eat. I was there for a weekend dinner and maybe i was lucky, the service i got was fast, medium friendly, food came really quick which was good for us hungry people, taste was decent too. Don't expect it to be AMAZING quality, but definitely fair value. I had lots of sashimi, too bad they didnt' have much tuna options."}
{"text":"Slow service. The ambience is great for hanging out and spending time wit people. But it took them a little too long of a time to serve us a few pieces of sushi."}
{"text":"I ate here this evening and will never go back. The waitress was incredibly rude and picked up my plate as I was literally taking the last piece of sushi off of it to put in my mouth. When we asked for the bill she punched the amount into the machine and walked off with the bill. 

The food was meh, to be honest I'm actually laying down writing this because I have horrible stomach pain and nausea so if I end up having full fledged food poisoning I wouldn't be surprised. 

Never, ever, again."}
{"text":"The service and quality of food are much better than the other Ajisai just north of Bloor Street on Yonge.  This location always leaves us a fresh pot of hot tea and this is one of the few AYCE places that brings everything we order!  And they are quite generous on the fish portion in handrolls, instead of only stuffing us with rice!  
It's not gourmet sushi and no sushi is ever going to be half as good as the sushi you can have in Japan.  So let's call it what it is, it's AYCE!!  For $21 a person with tips and tax on a weekday or $24/$25 on a weekend, I would definitely come here again for lunch (and then possibly enjoying a quiet night with a light dinner at home!!)"}
{"text":"Ajisai sushi...
This location is across Thornlea Secondary School, where I used to go to school. Because of the limited possibilities of foods around that area, I would always stumble upon Ajisai, unfortunately.
The place is okay looking, no special decors that stand out. The waiters/waitresses were nothing special, just the average mean looking, rude, \"I hate my life\" AYCE workers. (Especially the old looking man with glasses)
Food is as mediocre as it can get. Really nothing to note about the food. Pop is flat...
I wouldn't recommend this AYCE sushi restaurant at all. Bad service, average food."}
{"text":"had AYCE, service is nice. but the quality of food are about avg. sashimi is prepared a while ago?"}
{"text":"A-Ok! I work nearby and stopped in for some all you can eat lunch with my husband yesterday. I have been a few times before but it had been a long time. 

12.99 each for the AYCE and they had a very good selection. We got our money's worth with a few rolls (spicy salmon, shrimp tempura, butterfish), some nigiri (salmon, butterfish), green salads, miso soup, delicious green tea.

It was an enjoyable experience, friendly and attentive service (although they weren't very busy) and quality fish and not too much rice (a sushi pet peeve). I'd return but it's wasn't anything I haven't had elsewhere."}
{"text":"For an all-you-can-eat (AYCE) spot, great selection.  I'm not a fan of sushi, but i did have plenty of California rolls and other dishes that contained sauteed meats on beds of rices.  Salad was good too.  For an AYCE, not bad."}
{"text":"Went there a month ago and service was very slow. When I ordered, 1 meal came a couple minutes later but everything else took nearly an hour. All the sushi with weird unknown names are bad. All of them. I second the reviewer who says that the banana sushi is disgusting. I don't know who's idea it was to mix banana and fish but they should be shot! The rest of it was just ok..."}
{"text":"\"it was inspected Feb. 1 when one inspection item was found not in compliance (equipment, none food contact surfaces and/or linen were not satisfactorily maintained, constructed, installed and accessible for cleaning, and one item was corrected during inspection (proper storage of clean utensils unsatisfactory).

--March edition of Neighborhood News."}
{"text":"Last week marks the third time I've been here, and I am glad I gave Aji Sai a second chance. As per most AYCE places, you have a time limit when eating here (this is for the dinner menu, not sure if the lunch menu is different): 70 minutes of ordering time and 2 hours of eating time. The timer for both of these starts when you first come in. 

The first time I came here, I thought the place was nothing special, and didn't seem to stand up to the reviews that had been given to me by friends: a lot of the food seemed like it had been sitting around before it was brought over and service was slow/nothing special. The second time, I had a huge problem with the food: the tempura tasted like it was rotten or something and the avocado used in everything was very unripe, and when I sent it back they came back with new food that had the same problems. Both these times, I came in for lunch.

This third time, however, I pretty much have no complaints. Service was friendly and fast even though it was packed. We were a party of 5 but even still our orders were correct and there were no problems with the food. Another nice thing is that they don't pack the maki rolls full of rice, which they do at a lot of AYCE restos to try and fill you up faster. Dynamite, Rainbow California, Spicy Scallop and Aji Sai rolls are must-tries!

I would definitely suggest ordering off the dinner menu rather than lunch, because even though it's more expensive ($21 before tax), the menu is WAY better and includes a lot more options that are worth the extra money."}
{"text":"This isn't the best sushi in Toronto. (That would be Solo Sushi Ya, or Solo Sushi Bekkan.) Nor is it the best Japanese. But it's pretty great, and it's always reliable. Nothing tastes fishy, the rice is never cold, the tamagoyaki is always sweet, and they have plenty of eel. The vegetarian options are also pretty great: the veggie roll is good (it's hard to miss with sweet potato and avocado), the veggie tempura is still crisp after delivery, the agedashi tofu is soft and lovely, and the salads are surprisingly big for the price. I can't speak for the grilled items, but I really like their spicier rolls and, well, anything containing eel. They also put a dab of wasabi/horseradish on the nigiri before placing the fish over it, which I think is a nice, refreshing touch. 

Service-wise, they're always careful to tell us if it's a busy night for them and the delivery might take a while. It's a nice touch, and I don't recall anything ever being really late. Do order early: sushi can't really be rushed. At least, it shouldn't be."}
{"text":"The fish is fresh and the portions are generous, but as is common with Chinese run sushi restaurants, they tend to put more rice in the rolls than the fish itself. The all-you-can-eat buffet menu has about 40 different types of rolls which are good, many of which have interesting made up names to them. The hot foods are also tasty too! The tempuras are crunchy and the variety of teppanyakis are scrumptious! The service was fast and the servers are all smiles and patient. Not bad indeed."}
{"text":"This is legit the worst sushi restaurant I ever been too. I've been 4 times and each experience was got worst. My latest experience was the last straw. I went there with my boyfriend about last week first we were got a dirty glass out server was nice and changed it for us. The food was not fresh the fish was brown and really simple. But that wasn't even the worst. They have so much workers but none seem to understand what there position consists of. I asked the lady for a fork and she gave to the table behind me. There is a lack of knowledge of when to approach the customer. Take my advice and go elsewhere! They Dont even deserve the star but it seems mandtory"}
{"text":"YES! This is the go-to place for me to eat a lot for a little. GREAT fast service is astonishing. The menu works like this, dinner, one price, as much as you can eat brought FRESH from the kitchen to order for you. You can eat in rounds! You can eat so much, and share and as long as you eat it all then they don't charge you extra (for uneaten portions)  

I am so glad they opened a second room because it was always and justifiably packed.  Fast, tasty.  Great sushi, Great soups, salads, terriakki, rolls, etc etc.  Eat eat eat! and finish it off with fried banada, or green tea ice cream or egg pudding.  

LOVE IT!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to aji sai yesterday and found the whole experience terrible. They were sooo skimpy on the sashimi - each piece was  tiny and probably about 1/8 of an inch thick. We had to put two pieces together to make a normal piece (at least in terms of thickness) in any other sushi restaurant. When we asked for ice cream for dessert, the waitress was so confused because we want two bowls with multiple flavours. She ended up giving us one bowl for each flavour - and then we had to rearrange the scoops ourselves!!  
Not sure if there is new management or something but I've been before to aji sai - and this time was awful. I won't go back. For that price point, I'm sure there are other better options in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"My new favorite ayce sushi in town. The price is more than fair for what you get compared to other places. Tasty food and consistent variety, nice servers, awesome ambient, appropriate light and music also.
12,99 lunch and 20,99 dinner."}
{"text":"I have been here weekday and weekend both for lunch and dinner multiple times and think this is one of the best AYCE i have been to.

GOOD:
- lots of selection - their 'kitchen menu' (like general tso chicken) are actually REALLY delicious
- good roll selection - even the spider roll (which is normally soggy and gross at other AYCE) is good
- price is same for weekday and weekends
- fresh sushi


BAD:
- if you sit by the door it is freezing
- some of the 'kitchen menu' items while delicious, are a bit big in portion if you are a party of 2
- some of the servers are mean - this one lady (think she might be owner) in particular once got snippy at us because she thought we were going to waste food - I was just ordering more because friends had ordered things and i didn't want what they ordered

TIP:
- Call about 30 min before you show up to put your name 'on the list' and you can bypass the line that forms on weekends"}
{"text":"Bad service, food court quality, sticky floor..... One of the worst AYCE I have had tried.

The place looked rather decent based on the deco so we thought to give it a try (should have check Yelp reviews beforehand). Felt regreted once I stepped in and felt the sticky floor.

Servers looked miserable and acted like they dont care. Not one smiling friendly face. There was an older man who seemed to be in-charge of the place and he was the worst..... I guess the culture of poor service start from top down.

Food was not horrible but not decent either, definitley not worth the money. Foodcourt quality food I would say.

Not gonna go back."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had. The fact that we were waiting almost an hour for one platter on sushi and horrible service, the manager began to wait our table. What we got was plates/platters being thrown on the table and a disrespectful manager who did not have the slightest idea of customer service. Never going here again."}
{"text":"We went there with a big group of family and friends, ordering from the all you can eat dinner menu. I liked the mask rolls, with just the right amount of rice in them, not so filling. The Unagi maki was really good. The Sashimi was fresh and delicious. Though I always avoid chicken and beef at sushi places, the grilled chicken, and the grilled beef skewers looked so inviting. I tried them and they tasted really good. The brisket was also very good. The coconut shrimp was too good to avoid as well. The amazing thing was, after trying all these food, I still had lots of room for desert. 
All the ice creams were amazing. The red bean ice cream was my favorite. The mango pudding was tasty and cakes were OK too. The sesame buns were totally unavoidable. All of these came for the price of just $22."}
{"text":"Wow...Aji Sai

Don't go here if you want to lose complete faith in sushi and restaurants in general.

First up, they have waiters waiting at every table...so prepare for at least 25 visits from random servers throughout your \"meal.\"

We ordered grilled calamari...ok...thanks for the grilled squid on a plate with a piece of lettuce under neath with no seasoning...mmm plainly cooked squid....

Bento Box chicken teriyaki, three ordered, one comes 25 minutes after the first 2. 

Sushi platter, salmon not fresh, you can see it is dried from sitting out....tempura sushis are ice cold, I guess they do them ahead of time and store in the fridge?.....rice was dry.

Veggie tempura: yams aren't even cooked through! Raw yams with a fried coating...what? The only edible tempura was the broccoli and it was chewy.

Chicken teriyaki?...more like..chicken. There was maybe a teaspoon of sauce in with that chicken. 

The whole meal was eaten with an expression of disdain.

Go here if you want to feel violated through food, first time I've ever experienced that.
If I could I'd give it no stars I would."}
{"text":"Unbelievably horrible service.

We visited this restaurant around 3pm. It was packed and based on the sign posted outside we assumed that lunch hours are 11:30-3:30, and dinner is 5-11; and that meant that we could order from the lunch menu at 3pm. Apparently that is not the case. 

We entered the restaurant (party of 2). Nobody came forward to say hello. They shouted across the room to confirm that we are only 2. Then pointed to a table for us to sit at. A waiter came by in a rushed manner, threw the menus on the table and mentioned that they are now serving from the dinner menu. He then left as abruptly as he had arrived. 

Needless to say we left without hesitation."}
{"text":"Terrible - rude service. Sushi not good at all. Not worth $15.99 pp for lunch. I am so surprised how rude they were. Do not recommend at all. Attempted to charge us more for unfinished rice! Horrible!!! Beware!"}
{"text":"Where do I even begin.
This has been the worst sushi place I have EVER gone to. The worst service I have ever received at any restaurant has been from this place. The servers are rude and they don't even care about giving the customer a good experience to come back. 
I gave this place 2 chances and every single time it was the same thing. Zero care for the customer. The first time I went was with my boyfriend and we witnessed the server telling the customer \"don't forget to tip\" while handing the customer the machine. That was so disgusting, I've worked as a waitress through college and I've never asked a customer to tip, nor would I have made a big deal if they didn't. If I did a good job I deserved it if not that's my own problem. I took one bite of my california hand role and a hair was literally clinging on to the roll, i told the waiter and he didn't even care he just picked up the plate and that was that, i didn't get a \"sorry\" or even a new roll...AT AN ALL YOU CAN EAT PLACE.
 The second time I went with one of my friends and at the end of the meal we split the bill and I said I would pay the tip, after I was done paying my friend finished and the server held onto her card and said to her \"you didn't tip, you need to tip\" and I said I tipped for the both of us and he said she needs to tip as well, he would not return the card and he literally kept asking for her to tip. They are lucky I even tipped it was the worst service of my entire life and I will never be going here again. The food was okay but the outrageous service just made the experience awful."}
{"text":"Aji Sai is a busy AYCE place where you know there is lots of turnover and the fish is fresh. Solid menu, although I usually stick to sashimi and a few specialty rolls (try the green dragon).  Hot food is ok - I usually order a few items but the focus is on the fish for me. For those of us unfortunate to have non-seafood eaters as friends, at least they can tag along and order food other than sushi."}
{"text":"I have went to this place around 5 times during my high school years when I did not realize there were so many other options. During dinner services, I had received mediocre quality sushi, the only thing that made up for the meritocracy was the copious amounts of salmon sashimi my friends and I ordered one time. Sushi rolls were mediocre in the sense that some were falling apart, rice was crumbling off the roll, the ratio of fish to rice and seaweed was way off (tiny amounts of fish) and etc.
On another occasion, my friends and I went here for lunch. I guess we didn't tip them enough or as much as they liked because a couple of the servers swarmed together near us and gave us death stares and we could tell they were talking about us...pointing and gesturing in our direction and all. Moral of the story, yes their location is in their favour but there are plenty of other better AYCE sushi restaurants out there and this is DEFINITELY not of them."}
{"text":"This is a great AYCE sushi location with good variety of quickly prepared items. Be prepared for a 10 minute wait during the lunch and dinner rush."}
{"text":"Decent sushi. Don't sit near the front door in fall or winter. Sit near the back or on the west side because the front door opens and closes endlessly and let's all the cold air in. And will also waft in the sexy second-hand smoke."}
{"text":"Been here with family and friends about 5 times now. Sushi is good for AYCE. Service is always fast and friendly. Food is always fresh and accurate. The music they play kinda sucks a bit, but that is just a personal preference. I will be back here again!"}
{"text":"Looks like I've found a new sushi place!
I went here last night with a friend and we were both really impressed. The service was fast and friendly from the get-go.
The dining area is actually quite nice too -- which we weren't expecting from the outside.
My dining companion and I both ordered the dinner special (includes: miso soup, salad, california rolls, kappa rolls, an ebi (shrimp) nigiri, assorted tempura and chicken teriyaki for $9.99!)
We also split a 2-piece unagi (freshwater eel) nigiri, a 2-piece maguro (tuna) nigiri, and the spider maki.
The miso soup was tasty, as was the salad: loved the dressing!
next came the nigiri pieces and they were fresh and delicious. I especially liked the eel. Then the spider maki came and blew us away. We were fighting over the last piece.
This was probably the highlight.
The dinner came next, and we knew we were getting close to full, but it was so good, that we gobbled up most of it (my friend took part of hers home and I left a bit on the plate).
The tempura included shrimp and assorted veggies. The batter was light and crisp.
Everything was very fresh.
We ended up paying $20 each and were completely stuffed (with leftovers when we left).
I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great all you can eat lunch for $13. Good selection of rolls and hot food. Fire House Roll is a must try. I would strongly recommend this place for a good all you can eat experience in a nice decor. It does get busy at lunch time during the week."}
{"text":"I've been here two times both during lunch hour. The first time everything was slow, food took a VERY long time to make and the restaurant was not overly busy. The server kept spilling tea on me every time she would pour. 

Second time, it wasn't very different from the first experience. This time I didn't need an umbrella. 

This is a franchise, so other Aji Sais are different (read: better). I would recommend going to a different sushi place since there are so many."}
{"text":"One of the better AYCE sushi places in the downtown area - Obviously it's not going to be the absolute best quality if it's all you can eat, but it's the best of its type. 

I've had 2 large gatherings here, and both times they were able to accommodate us relatively well - I booked for 18 people for my birthday on a Friday, changed it to 23 people the day before the reservation, and about 27 people actually showed up, but they were really accommodating and managed to make it work, even though the place was really busy. The service was also great for a 27-person party, they split us all up into small groups and they managed to get all the orders right.

I recommend Aji Sai, but would recommend making a reservation before you go, as it gets pretty busy. l'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"One of the worst AYCE. Waste of $17.50. My cousins and I went here today for lunch. Waited about 10 min for seating. We ordered immediately and the food arrived 45 min later. We lost our appetite as they good arrived very late. Sushi was in a river of spicy mayo. DISGUSTED PLEASE STAY AWAY. I rather eat a hot dog off the street. Quality of sushi was absolute garbage
The waiters were very rude but I don't blame them as they were very busy. 
Please
Don't go here if you don't want to waste money and time"}
{"text":"My first encounter with sushi was at Aji Sai, and you may call me a romantic for visiting Aji Sai as regularly as possible ever since. Of course, for the affordable $13+tax+tip AYCE lunch buffet. I won't call it a sushi lunch buffet, because Aji Sai has SO MUCH MORE to offer beyond sushi.

FOOD:
- Really good sushi for the price (relative to AYCE sushi bars for under $20). I have been to fancier, well-acclaimed places (read: JapanGo), and they have failed to match up to Aji Sai.
- Has a really diverse lunch menu including sushi, hand rolls, special rolls, teppenyaki, other miscellaneous stuff, and dessert. It's incredible. The new menu now describes the special rolls on the flipside, which is helpful.
- I would list all my favourites, but I'd go over the character limit. But my top picks are: [Special rolls]: Dynamite, Firehouse, Spicy Atlantic Smoked Salmon, Shrimp Tempura Rolls, Green Dragon, Black Dragon. [Teppenyaki]: Chicken Teriyaki [From the kitchen]: Gyoza, Sesame chicken. Veal chop. (the veal chop was AWESOME).

Food rating: 6/5! 

PRICE:
- All that for 13+tax+tip?!? 

Price rating: 5/5

DECOR:
- Given it's popularity, it used to be swamped. It still is swamped. But they have expanded their space. Pretty spacious
- Comfortable cushiony sofa-style seating.
- Renovated decor = pretty good. 

Decor rating = 4/5

SERVICE:
- Although it's usually super-busy, they have enough competent staff that are constantly circulating to take orders or refill the green tea or to answer questions / cater to requests (I always need more ginger!)
- They won't tell you their name, or smile. In their model of efficiency, they don't have time for that. And I prefer it that way. Get me my sushi pronto, and I'm a happy panda!

Service rating: 5/5

Why to go there? 
- Why NOT to go there? Can't think of a reason. Unless you're looking for a fancy sushi bar with sushi circulating on a boat, this is your place to go for sushi!

Additional tips:
- They don't take reservations. And they are very popular. So you may have to wait. Especially if you have a large group. 
- AYCE Lunch buffet is between 12-3."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to go to aji sai today. I've been craving sushi and I went specifically downtown for some because I thought those AYCE in toronto must be much superior than those in Mississauga. 

Boy was I wrong.
A quick warning for mississaugans, even though yangs and aji sai are rated the same (3.5 stars), yangs is far superior!

To start, I liked the atmosphere and ambiance was nice. We were seated quickly, but the tables were kind of small, no big deal though. So ambience: 4 stars. 

And that was the best part of the whole experience. 

First of all, the fish was warm. Warm. As if it had been sitting outside for like a good 10 min warm. Rice was also warm. When I bit into it, it wasn't the nice, fresh feel but felt sickening. For the handrolls, the spicy salmon felt like it had been absolutely butchered then mixed, not pleasant. The \"grilled salmon\" was also covered in fat, and had an odd fishy smell to it. To be fair, the fat was because it was the salmon belly, and also since the waiter didn't make us eat the fatty skin we didn't have I endure that in our stomaches, nonetheless I have had much better grilled salmons. The deep fried tofu was also extremely bland. The wakame was covered in sauce, which was good but it was dredged. 
The good food was really the black dragon roll (and that's being generous since som pieces didn't even have eel on top) and the firehouse rolls. Other ones were honestly mediocre. Another downside was that they didn't have shrimp tempura! That was pretty disappointing. They also don't have sushi pizzas, or deep fried scallops at lunch which are some of my favourite AYCE menu items. But what was good that I tried for the first time (based on fellow yelpers reviews) was the cheese wontons which were really good. 

On the topic of service, the staff was semi nice but constantly got orders wrong. We had to have plates taken away several times because of wrong orders. Tempura also takes a while because the sweet potato is cut too thick. And by the end, us and our next table just looked to each other when we got the wrong dishes and corrected it between us instead. 
Ice cream was good. But it always is. 

Oh and just a warning, their sushi comes in large servings, of usually 6-8 per type d roll, so go with a lot of people to try more. 

All in all, slightly disappointed. I expected a mediocre experience but I got under that, hence the 2 stars. I'm probably going to stick to yangs or 168 sushi from now on"}
{"text":"Poor quality food. We came in around 9:30, it was quite busy but it does not excuse the food from being served warm. We ordered several dishes that we normally order at typical ayce sushi locations that we go to in GTA area. Salmon belly, grilled mackerel, crab cakes and pretty much all other warm dishes were served COLD. So disappointed because when we entered, It looked like the restaurant would please. 

The service was also pretty bad. The server approached our table, without even saying hello, dropped off two waters, and went off. I'm not sure if these waiters are burnt out but seriously.. I used to be a waitress for 6 years, and the least you could do is say hello (I'm not even asking you to smile). 
Towards the end of our dinner, that same server dropped of the bill and again walked off, without evening saying thank you (nothing).

Overall, I would never go back here. Really wanted some sushi, but was very disappointed."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN!!

After visiting this establishment regularly for the better part of a decade, today was the LAST time.

I left no more than a palmful of uneaten sushi rice and was notified by the server that the \"boss\" told him next time I would be charged.

The \"boss\" (manager) was a frowning man who literally stared me down while eating to ensure I finished every last morcel.

First of all, I'm paying you $20+ to eat my food in peace and not be harassed for leaving a small amount of uneaten white rice.

Second of all, if you, the \"boss\", have an issue then come speak with me politely yourself. Don't dispatch the poor server to come and do your dirty work. Gutless.

I seldom complain but the service here was beyond poor, it was demeaning and showed a total lack of regard for me as a loyal customer."}
{"text":"So two of my friends an I decide to try Aji Sai sushi. Everything seemed fine at first but while eating I noticed how tiny the sushi rolls were compared Maki Sushi just west of Aji Sai. So as I'm eating the Green Dragon roll, I start to choke on a piece of bone that I finally spat out onto my plate...thankfully!
I told the gentleman dressed different than the other waiters (probably owner or manager) that there was a large chunk of bone regurgitated from my throat, and he proceeded to tell me that the bone came from the fish. Well thank you for the marvelous explanation but I knew that. I must have thought it came from a turkey. I asked if there was anything they can do to compensate for such a lack luster service. He said no, so I asked for a discount.  He said OK, just 10%. I said OK, took out my wallet and credit card and he said oh, no no no! I can only give this discount if you pay cash. So I walked over to the bank to get cash.

When I came back everyone working there was giving me dirty looks. I looked at the bill, and my calculations showed a discount of what seemed to be a 10% discount. Original bill totalled $63 and the new bill showed $57 and change. I left $60 and the waiter flagged the (manager/owner) and stuck two fingers to show him there was only a $2 tip. The manager with a dirty grin looks at me and shakes his head. Continuing to get dirty looks I decided to keep my mouth shut and leave.

I as a matter of fact have a over tipping problem. But this time...NO

Even through the window I was still getting dirty looks. I will NEVER eat there again. Very disappointed and the one star I am trying to give them is for the chefs that work and barely utter a word. Its a shame."}
{"text":"As an admitted sushi snob, I'm very hesitant to go to AYCE sushi establishments. However, my colleague wanted to come to Aji Sai for her birthday lunch, and I must admit that I was happily surprised. For ~$15 AYCE sushi, the quality was definitely better than imagined. $15 for AYCE?? Seriously? That's the price of ONE roll anywhere else. Definitely pay a visit to Aji Sai if you're on a budget and craving cheap sushi that doesn't taste like cardboard."}
{"text":"The service isn't great but the food is.  It's cheap and good.  Both times, the waiters forgot at least one order."}
{"text":"I gave it 2 stars just because it used to be a good place. Have been there so many times in last couple of years. First thing i noticed was quality of the food and service have declined recently. I don't know why but staff there feels me like i have done something wrong. Wont be back for some time for sure."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place a couple of years ago, but I went tonight and it was horrible. The menu had changed and nothing was explained. Service was terrible and I had to ask multiple times for things. Servers didn't look too thrilled being there. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I get deliveries from Aji Sai, and it's good food at a good price. They're pretty fast too."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant and had high hopes. It won best all you can eat sushi on blogTO.com (why? We have really NO idea). The menu is extensive and there are descriptions of each special sushi. Looks promising at first... 

We made our order but realized that as food was arriving to our table that it was not ours! We pointed out the error but the wrong orders kept on coming. Turns out the table next to us was getting our orders and vice versa. Finally, we got our correct orders and it was mind-boggingly disgusting. We eat Japanese food in all different cities all the time, and this was by far the worst. Some highlights (lowlights?):

- Soy sauce was extremely salty. Barely edible. Not sure what brand it was. 
- \"Japanese\" fried chicken was seasoned with something bizarre tasting, was almost completely fried bits and no chicken, and was not appetizing.
- Mackarel sashimi was completely off and foul tasting. My partner is currently in the bathroom dealing with food poisoning from eating 2 pieces -- luckily, I didn't eat it and spit out the first bite. Just horrible and never tasted food that had gone bad like that.
- Seafood soup was simply hot broth mixed with a tremendous amount of oil, wakame seaweed, and fatty salmon and salmon skin. Inedible and sent it back.
- Tempura was heavy, coated with super thick batter, and came with a flavorless brown broth for dipping (not authentic--not even sure what it was. Soy sauce mixed with water, it tasted like)
- Sushi was poorly made and some had seasoned bits of fake crab meat simply dumped on top in a big awkward pile. How to eat that?!
- Several of our orders were missing but we just gave up and left.

$25 each, poor service with no apologies, and absolutely horrendous and low quality food. WILL NOT BE BACK. Beware, people. Food poisoning is no joke."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch for the a-la-carte option on a weekday. Ordered the California box bento (~$8.95) which comes with Deep Fried Tofu, California Roll & Salad, Dumplings and complimentary soup. 

The box was merely just reached standard expectations, the California roll didn't have much filling inside so it was pretty much just rice and seaweed. I also found the deep fried tofu to be too oily and drenched in too much sauce. I just took it out of the deep fried outer layer and ate only the actual tofu. Salad was not fresh and you can easily tell by the stale green mix.

Service was alright and food did come out in decent timing which is important when you are trying to make the most out of your lunch hour. I wouldn't recommend coming here unless you are just looking to have a quick Japanese lunch."}
{"text":"Good customer service. One of the best AYCE. in Toronto.  Good choices. It is crowded during lunchtime.  Price is fair."}
{"text":"The sushi sucks so bad.

Save yourself the sadness and pay and extra $5 and eat less food and be happy eating a a restaurant that is not all you can eat.

The staff is good.
Service is standard.
The venue is cheap.
The rice sucks and so does the fish.
It taste like poor quality fish and rice.

The lunch menu does not offer staple items like edamame, tuna anything, or sashimi for lunch.

Eat here if your hungry, don't have money to eat elsewhere, and don't mind if you sushi tastes horrible.for quantity."}
{"text":"Food is passable as sushi. Service is hilariously horrible. None of the waiters have a smile on their face, and forget your order all the time. 

The price is decent but the should be cheaper considering the service and quality of food.

I would recommend if you're tired from a long day or hangover and need to shove as much dead fish wrapped in seaweed down your throat as you can."}
{"text":"When this place first opened i thought it was great; since then, however, i think its gone down hill in both quality & service. There is so much competition in the AYCE sushi space, that you would think they would make more of an effort, especially in the service department. 

The food is good. Above average for sure. Just not great."}
{"text":"Went there for a casual bite with my hubby on a Friday night. The place was full, there were only two tables available, and we got the best one of them (soon after we saw people lining up). It looked like there were only 3 servers, continuously cruising with food, drinks and bills. Nevertheless, we got someone helping us right away, we were still debating whether we should do AYCE or a la carte and she gave us both menus to decide and ran off to help other clients.
We decided to stick to a la carte and ordered seaweed salads, tonkatsu, firehouse roll, spicy crispy salmon roll, black dragon roll. Wakame salads were served right away, and the food arrived very quickly just as we were finishing the salads! Loved the Firehouse roll - very interesting combination of fish and banana! Other rolls and tonkatsu were also good 
The only low was that it took a while to get our bill, but we thought that it's better to wait for the bill while you are pleasantly satiated, than for the food (which was quick to arrive)."}
{"text":"I am becoming more and more convinced that Torontonians don't know good sushi or are willing to settle for extremely poor quality (which is probably the case given the plethora of terrible sushi places in this city). 

I came here with friends. I don't know why. I don't even believe in AYCE on principle. This was food with no soul and no flavour. I didn't think it was possible for sushi to be boring, but this was. The rice was not seasoned. Every roll tasted the same. The textures were one homogenous mush. The cooked dishes were overloaded with salt. The service was provided begrudgingly. 

Why eat out at all?"}
{"text":"I ate at this place twice. The first time, I thought the service was so horrible that I was so turned off. The waiters just dump your plates on the table, the sushi chefs are behind the sushi bar cracking jokes and laughing, you wait at least 10mins for your sushi to come out.

So we tried to give the place a second chance. This time, a lady at another table began to complain about the service. When the Manager/Owner attended to her, he rolled his eyes at her and said \"ya ya well, you're the one that ordered this food, next time don't order it\". I was SHOCKED and I realized that if the owner is like this then we can't expect better from his staff.

Food is also very average ... So we won't be going back there!"}
{"text":"*3.5 Stars 

One of my go-to places for cheap decent sushi. Its actually above decent but I've seen the quality go down from the past few years. I haven't been there for dinner so this review is mainly for the lunch AYCE menu. 

For 11.99 you get a decent selection of rolls kitchen items and sushi, the food is OK but the service is below standard, they seem to be rushing me out everything I decide to eat there. This is why you dont get 4 stars."}
{"text":"This has got to be the absolute WORST AYCE sushi that I've ever been to.  I don't even normally write reviews but the meal was so awful that I just have to warn others. For reference, we went today for lunch at $12.99 per person.

1) The Mackerel sushi was so disgusting that I almost threw up. It tasted like fish gone bad.

2) The sushi rolls were so poorly constructed. Every roll we ordered look like it was home-made by kids who were making sushi for the first time. Things were breaking apart, the rolls were warm and the flavours just didn't work. Ie. Spicy Salmon Roll had way too much mayo.

3) Really slow service: We waited at least 15 mins for each of our orders to come. Other tables around us were constantly asking for the waiters to check on their orders too.

$12.99 may seem like a great value and they do have a decent selection. Perhaps I went on an \"off day\" for them given all the positive reviews below. However, I would never return this restaurant again....EVER. Unless you just want to get full and don't care about the taste, I recommend you to avoid this place too."}
{"text":"Sushi is so yummi. The staff are so welcoming. Lavish lunch at a nominal price. It's great!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for cheap sushi, come here. If you're looking for good sushi, DO NOT come here. 

Their lunch special is 12.99 all you can eat. But BEWARE - they will charge you extra for what you don't finish. 

An absolute outrage. I will never come here again, and recommend that you don't either"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this all you can eat sushi place a lot before writing a review. First off the service can be terrible or great depending on the time of day you go. Servers do ignore you sometimes when they're busy and that's a fact. The food here is always been consistent .They never disappointment you or surprise you. I know coming to aji sai will give me a above decent sushi for all you can eat. Overall I'll give it 4/5 stars for being consistent and having food above other all you can eat places."}
{"text":"The quality and service lacks, eye contact is avoided like the plague. No plans to return."}
{"text":"The diverse food menu is wonderful. Being a sushi critic myself, this restaurant is one of the few that use Atlantic Smoked Salmon. However, the sushi rolls sometimes fall apart but is definitely well worth the value and quality. They also have mango and green tea sushi!   

The some of the servers here are very rude. And the menu does state that they charge for remaining left over food."}
{"text":"Recent return for my wife and I, three years since our first date of which this place played an important part. Excellent service, sushi and tempura outstanding. Fresh salmon, loved the eel hand roll."}
{"text":"Staff was nice and food was delicious, but try to get in early. Bad place to sit: right by the front entrance. Expect to find a bunch of inpatient visitors hungrily staring at you."}
{"text":"I live 5 mins from this place but I had no idea it existed until a company lunch last week. Excellent food and staff. This was on a Wednesday afternoon, not at a super busy time.

Atmosphere:  We booked a private room for 6. When we arrived we found everything was clean and well organized. They have a coat rack at the front door so it was convenient during winter, plus the neighborhood is good so you can feel safe leaving your coat and just taking your valuables with you. It was quiet, no overly powerful background noises (music/talking etc).

Service: the staff are very attentive and knowledgeable, they give you full attention when you order and helped us figure out portioning and dietary/allergy issues. 

Food: All of our sushi was prepared promptly and displayed beautifully. The portioning was flexible, so we can order per piece for tempura. I highly recommend the short ribs and skewers. The unagi handroll was to die for. The miso soup was a bit salty according to my co-workers, but for me it was perfect (I got used to mixing it with rice when I was in traveling Japan). 

I would stay away from those odd named rolls like AK47 or Tropical because deep fried rolls are always filled with tempura scrap/fillers. But my friends loved them, I stuck with my sushi and green dragon rolls. One thing I liked was that their menu was extensive but everything was in stock (rare for lunch buffets).

Price: I have no clue, the company paid, I think for the 5 of us was around $130 with wine, we even used a coupon for shishimi (when we left we found it was expired but they accepted it anyway without fuss).

I've always advocated that if you are going to do AYCE sushi, don't, just go and pay the little extra at an a la carte place if you have a whole bunch of friends splitting the bill, the price is about the same and you'd be surprised what other neat stuff is out there."}
{"text":"Love sushi and have tried tons tons of all you can eat sushi places around Toronto. The rolls here aren't so bad, they are very typical so there is nothing fun and interesting or new that you could try. The service is pretty awful. They are slow, they forget about you and you constantly have to yell out or get up to grab them. They are also pretty rude and a couple of times have put the miso soup down so roughly that they have sloshed it everywhere on the table. The fish isn't as fresh as you would hope, its also over-refridgerated so we had some sashimi come to the table so cold and almost frozen.

I would reccomend other sushi places over this one unless you are desperate and in the area."}
{"text":"the foods good but I wish there was a bigger choice of sushi"}
{"text":"The food's pretty good for an all-you-can-eat and I've gone back 3 times so I would rally rate this restaurant a 4 for just food.

Wait times are not too bad. I went during a Saturday lunch rush (around 1:30 pm) and was seated within 5 mins so that was good.

The service. That was awful. AWFUL. The waitress who served us slammed our salad down and that too at the edge of the table. Almost fell off. The wait time for the dishes weren't too bad but the way we were served was horrendous. No smile, no greeting, rude curt answers to any question that we had. Asked for a beer menu and was finally served by another waitress.

We were presented with our bill even before we were done eating (!!) Asked for separate checks and was given a lot of attitude. At that point, I was so frustrated with our service that I decided to make a statement with the tip. She actually ASKED for more. 

All in all, good enough a place to eat if you want to brave really crappy service."}
{"text":"We have been there quite a few times for the \"all you can eat\" sushi dinner.  We always felt that it was decent value food but keep in mind this is mostly rice... real sushi has some protein but it is mostly rice.  We found the Canadianised food like sweet and sour chicken, general chicken and other more main stream things were quite good.  Much better than other asian restaurants.  They were closed down for many months supposedly for renovations so we have not been for awhile.  The selection was always quite massive and of course the food was always fresh.  Nothing bad to say about this place.  I would not say it is cheap per se but reasonable for that odd occasion you want sushi fresh.  A family of 4 will likely be coming in for about $100 more or less so in GTA that is quite cheap."}
{"text":"I used to like going here, since the food was decent and it was close to home...until tonight. As we are sitting there trying to enjoy our meal, the sushi chef coughed non stop. Not a small \"I've got a tickle in my throat cough\" but  a disgusting phlegmy\"I'm sick, and I'm gonna spread it around cough\". Not only was he coughing non stop, but he made no attempt at covering him mouth at all!! After he sprayed the raw fish with his germs, he then proceeded to bring up phlegm behind the sushi bar, again, without trying to hide it, or be hygienic.  I don't even want to know where he spat it out.  I will never eat there again  In Fear that this actually how little they know,or care about proper food handling and hygiene. I know who to blame if I wake up tomorrow with a disgusting cough."}
{"text":"I've been here about 5 times for my usual sushi cravings. 

The first time i went, we were extremely rushed and had about a 40 minute wait just to be seated. Food was pretty good. Each time I've been there, they're very heavy on the rice. I've noticed if you order a large amount of sushi, they usually give you less than you've ordered (which is a blessing in disguise) but you'll have to reorder again. They assume right after you order dessert, even if it's one scoop of ice cream they'll give you your receipt.

Overall it's average, for $12.99 it's decent. I'd go again, but nothing special, just a place i go to to satisfy my sushi cravings.

Btw, as far as service goes, it's pretty crap. I hear the girls whining about their problems while im being served, i've seen \"jennifer\" eat under the table while on the clock."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Aji Sai for the first time last saturday and its a very cute and cozy place. When we entered they seated us right away, thank God after we sat down it got bust right away.
So we ordered, and they made a mistake and messed up our order the first time after waiting about 15- 20 min.

Thank God we were not rude and impatient people and we gave them a chance, the waiter came and apologized and rushed our order, which came right away. It was delicious and worth the price and wait.

Try it  :)"}
{"text":"While the AYCE food here is not bad, they have absolutely terrible service.
I was there on yesterday, a Thursday after work hours.
I was sitting towards the back of the restaurant. The waiters/waitresses do not come by often. I had to constantly wave frantically for them to see us. As a result, we do not get water/tea refills as often as we do at other restaurants.
The waitress that took our order had issues hearing we wanted one of the dishes canceled (upon ordering), to be replaced by something else. So when the food came and we asked her to take it back (we do not want to waste food), she gave up a nasty glare. Then, the dish that was suppose to replaced her by-mistake taken order never came (and so did the remaining ones that got missed and never came as well) So we followed up again. She then proceeded to say, \"you want BIG or SMALL dish, you know, if you order and you don't finish, you have to PAY for it.\". Her tone was truly rude!

I'd been to the other Aji Sai and had had much better service than what I'd experienced last night. I do not think I'd like to come back to this restaurant anymore."}
{"text":"They have changed their menu and took some of the good things out. The sushi are extremely tiny and not well made. The kitchen food doesn't taste too appetizing. 

It's quite sad to see my once favourite all you can eat sushi joint is just going downhill. 

Not interested in coming back anytime in the future. What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Good food with great selection; definitely value for your money.
It becomes quite busy, so service could get a bit slow."}
{"text":"This is hands-down my favourite AYCE sushi place in the city.  Not only that, but it manages to differentiate itself by having a somewhat modern/upscale/trendy ambiance as compared to other sushi places in the city.  The ceilings are adorned with chandeliers and the tables and booths are much better than usual seating options.  However, BEWARE OF SITTING NEAR THE WINDOWS!  It gets absolutely frigid in the winter and even though they seemed to be battling this issue with space heaters, I ended up wearing my jacket throughout the entire meal.  Huge downer.

Food:  The food and menu selections are plentiful and everything is really quite good (especially for AYCE).  The sashimi is fresh, the rolls come out fast and are tasty.  Nothing is overladen with rice as tends to be the case with AYCE places.  One of the standout dishes for me was the Sushi Pizza although on more than one meal I've had to remind the server several times that we ordered it (not sure why they're so reluctant to serve it).  Its crispy and the salmon on top is a great contrast.  Very reminiscent of the crispy sushi I once had at Katsuya.  The other big draw is that they carry butterfish and it is scrumptious!

Service:  The service is also very good.  Servers are plentiful and you are consistently being asked if you have everything you need.  

Price: This one is where they're really a winner - price is only $20 per person for all you can eat!  I have oftentimes paid the same at regular sushi joints.

Overall, my experience was great and would've been 4 stars if they could've fixed the coldness issue (or at least warned us about it)!"}
{"text":"This is a decent AYCE sushi place for dinner.  The service is generally quick, and the sushi is good for the price.  However, they have fewer items on their AYCE lunch menu, so if you're a fan of seaweed salad or sashimi, wait for the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Sigh. Aji Sai.  Where do I start.  

First, I live down the street from Aji Sai, so I enjoy it, and frequent this place because of the convenient location.  I've eaten here many, MANY times - I would say that I go AT LEAST once a month.

Next - AYCE.   Love this.  There are quite a number of other sushi places along Queen Street - some look a bit sketchy so I avoid them.  As for the more presentable looking ones, they don't have AYCE, which I prefer which is another reason I choose to go to Aji Sai.

The food - always great quality.  Well, for the most part.  Last time I was there I ordered the chicken katsu and my boyfriend ordered (I think) sweet and sour chicken and the chicken katsu wasn't very satisfying.  There was more batter than chicken, and the whole thing just tasted of deep fried batter, and it looked as if the oil had not been changed in a while maybe.  Looks like the sweet and sour chicken had been fried in the same oil, and it looked quite greasy.  Speaking of deep fried, that's not to say, however that their tempura isn't great, because it always is!  Love the shrimp tempura here and the batter is always crispy and it looks like the tempura is fried in clean oil.

More often than not, this place is packed and in those cases you will have to wait a little to be seated (about 10 - 15 mins typically).  The lineup grows quickly and the line tends to get a bit disorganized as they don't usually take names (they just ask for number of people).

Now, the service.  Every time I come here and experience the service, I always wonder why I keep coming back.  It's like I choose to forget about the terrible service because the food is always so satisfying.  However, the last time I was there, the service seemed exceptionally terrible.  The servers always tend to look miserable and often seem to have a sour attitude about them.  As previously mentioned, I have been here a countless number of times, and last week was the first time I saw a friendly, seemingly happy server at this restaurant.  I remember making a comment to my boyfriend about how surprisingly friendly she was, as it was very rare to see servers like that at Aji Sai.  When I think about that conversation, it blows my mind as friendly service should be standard, not an exception!  Come to think of it, I didn't recognize her so I wonder if she is new.   

It seems they don't have one dedicated server per table/section, so when it gets particularly busy (which is often) you'll have about 3 different servers providing you with half-assed service.  On my last visit, we placed our first order shortly after being seated, and only moments after had a second waiter attempt to take our order. On our second order, we had ordered the cheese wontons and it was served to us - no joke - 30 seconds after the order was placed.  I'm pretty sure our waiter hadn't even put the order in, but a server already brought us the wontons.  5 minutes later, another serving of wontons came out and we had to let them know that we had already gotten them.  On the other hand, sometimes they will forget to bring you part of your order as well (or perhaps it is served to another table by accident).  This has happened to me on a few visits.  Last time I was there I ordered shrimp tempura with my first order with waiter #1, and it never came.  Someone from the kitchen came out to serve us something from our second order, and so we asked her about the shrimp tempura and she said she would check on it and retreated back into the kitchen never to be seen again.   We then asked waiter #1 about it again, and he said that it was on its way.  After about 15 more minutes, we asked waiter #2 about it, and she said she would check on it (at this point we had already finished everything else we had ordered).   After about 10 more minutes, we got so fed up with waiting that we just asked for the bill and told them to forget about the shrimp tempura, and waiter #2 said \"It's coming out right away. I just put the order in. Didn't you just order it?\" to which I had to let her know that I had ordered it when I first sat down, about an hour earlier.   I also know that the table next to us had ordered sushi pizza which never came out as well.  At the end of their meal the waiter had asked them if they ever received it, and they told him that they hadn't and that they figured it was just forgotten, so they no longer wanted it and had him cancel it so they could get their bill.

Aji Sai really has the food part in the bag.  If they could just improve their service (and I'm talking a major improvement), I'd give it 5 stars.  Unfortunately, I'm sure as hell not \"teaching them a lesson\" by going back time and time again despite the terrible service, so I guess what difference does it make to them?  As long as they get my money (and clearly a lot of other people's money), I'm sure they're happy and feel as though they're doing everything right."}
{"text":"I wrote a semi-favourable review about this location months, when I used to frequently visit for lunch and/or after late nights at the office (a year/two ago). I recently went once again ( a couple weeks ago) when I was introducing my mom to AYCE sushi and I regret it entirely. It was great that it was full as always but I finally realized how bad the quality is, especially in terms of sushi pizza and spicy salmon rolls (my favourite items to get at sushi establishments). Other rolls we had were generally really sloppy; they fell apart and were tiny. The shasimi was thin. The quality was awful and left much to be desired.

The service isn't all that great either. They still regularly forget items and some servers were not friendly. I had to ask multiple servers every time I wanted something (ie. ginger, wasabi, spicy mayo, tea, an ordering sheet- which was rudley thrown on our t able!!). I had to ask multiple servers over a large span of time just to hope one did their job accordingly. 

All in all, I will not be going back to this place in the future nor will I continue to recommend it."}
{"text":"Awful service and terrible food. They even charge extra for left over and was told \"any food you left over it must charge extra 6 dollars compare to the regular price of dishes\". Be careful when ordering people!!! It's a place that I def won't go for the second time!!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food. Open late. Always good to satisfy my sushi craving. This restaurant is clean and the service is always fast. It is always busy so you know the food is fresh"}
{"text":"I came here with my gf for lunch, AYCE. We came here at around three o'clock in the afternoon. And the waitress gave us the dinner price immediately. We then ordered some sushi, about five different kinds of them. As a result they taste all the same, just like sushi rice wrapped with a layer of plastic. The teriyaki tastes a little bit better than their sushi, but it was as plain as it could be. We sat on those sofa place and it was quite dark. The atmosphere was just fine, and the waitresses were not bad. I will give one star for their service. Anyway, we're not coming back again."}
{"text":"Best AYCE sushi we've had in Toronto. No sure what the negative reviews are for. Order early after you sit down and there are no problems with service. Sushi was good quality and well crafted with care- not falling apart or giant in size like a lot of all you an eat places.  Would definitely come back again. We cane for dinner, but the 12.99$ for lunch is an amazing price!"}
{"text":"The service was awful and the food is not good enough to make it worth a second chance."}
{"text":"OK for an AYCE sushi joint. Service is pretty quick, lots of menu options. I've been here several times in the past with friends and the servers were always rude - however, I was pleasantly surprised today when the servers were friendly and accommodating. 

I usually am happy with the salmon sushi, spicy salmon maki rolls and salmon sashimi (I love salmon!). I usually love their cheese wanton, however, today I noticed that the wantons were different - the shells were hard and dry, not like the usual fluffy and crispy style I've had before. 

Would visit again with a large group of people. 

Cheers!

{"text":"TERRIBLE. People in Toronto who like this place have never tried good Sushi.

I was in the area so thought I would try it out. Not sure why as there are only about 5 good Japanese restaurants in the city. Ones run by Koreans - mainly or Chinese are usually terrible. What's worse, they charge you for what you don't eat so you are forced to eat even items you don't like.

My butterfish and makeral were both still partially frozen, the \"Japanese \" chicken was overlooked and salty, each dish I had just tasted terrible.

It is all you can eat so what can one expect and most people in this city do not know what a good restaurant is. They prefer quantity over quality.

It was my first and last time at this restaurant and yes, the staff are about the rudest I've come across. 

Reviews probably won't make a difference on this place as the only thing they care about is getting people in and out and the patrons only care about being able to eat as much as possible at an inexpensive price. Anyone who has enjoyed real sushi places in Toronto - Hiro, Zen, even Sushi Couture, don't even bother with this place. 

I think Sushi Inn in Yorkville is even better than Aji Sai, and Sushi Inn is pretty disgusting as well."}
{"text":"This is by far the best AYCE sushi place in the downtown core. The quality is great for AYCE. 
The place is run by Chinese people so do expect Chinese service. Food will come very quickly.  No one is going to come to ask how your food is and  I don't mind that. It's a bit difficult to get waiters attention for needs. That's my only negative comment, along with lack of tuna sashimi on the menu."}
{"text":"I've been seeing a ton of positive reviews on Yelp lately revolving the ayce at Aji Sai. Finally got a chance to hit this one with a group of 5 and I must say from a price perspective, it is the place to go!

First impression was yelpers have been doing way too much hyping because the line is so bloody long! usually a good sign especially considering it was a weekday. I had called in earlier to see if a reservation could be made, but it was not allowed during the lunch hour for obvious reasons. Total wait time was about 10 minutes which was quite reasonable given the smaller size of the location.

The food portions are very reasonable, and the speed of delivery for the sushi was great. my Favorite roll was definitely the one with the bananas,  I've forgotten what it was called. the quality of the non sushi/maki food items was pretty average for an AYCE joint. The servers were very reasonable and make this AYCE a much better experience than most I've been to both in the toronto proper, GTA and outside toronto.

I would give Aji Sai at Queen and Spadina a 3.5. 2 for the sushi/maki. 0.5 for the price point, 1.0 for the service."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good all you can eat sushi spot. The menu is massive and most of the food is decent. The service is fast and the ambiance is what you would expect from a high turn over all you can eat sushi place on Queen west. I've definitely had better sushi, but for the price and volume of food you can eat - this is a pretty good spot. I would recommend coming here on a date, but if you and a few friends are up for gorging on sushi and other asian dishes this is not a bad choice.

Here are my recommendations:
Sushi pizza
Cheese Dumplings aka Ragoons
All the different maki rolls
Beef short ribs
General Chicken
seaweed salad"}
{"text":"Would've given it 4 but then the service is not that great. But the variety is wonderful. 
Have the Yakitori and the veal!!!"}
{"text":"I eat here weekly for lunch if I can, as do many of my colleagues. Reasonably-priced and a good variety (bento boxes, tempura, sushi, sashimi, udon-just skip the pork). Friendly, if rushed, staff. Pricier at night but an easy dinner out."}
{"text":"Would return. Constant tea refills, food comes out fast but freshly made for a buffet. My new go to AYCE place in toronto. Clean. Washrooms are a little battered and down a steep staircase. Be careful after too much sake! Kinda feel like going there right now just cause I'm thinking of it. 20.99 AYCE dinner, 12.99 AYCE lunch. Definitely a fair price for the food you're getting. Unlimited sashimi during dinner, don't know about lunch."}
{"text":"Can't say anything negative about this place because You get exactly what you pay for. 14.99 all you can eat is gonna taste like 14.99 all you can eat. Perfectly fine for a cheap sushi joint!"}
{"text":"I have had sushi all in the danforth and love coming here since they have fresh and soft sushi. 

They have fast service and are very accommodating when I need to customize an order due to some dietary restrictions. 

I have had soups here as well and feel refreshed after having lunch there. It's light and feels healthy.  I for sure recommend this place"}
{"text":"Best all you can eat so far. 
Consistently good. Menu is wide ranging. Salmon is the best mmmm
Yes the mugs are covered in bleach, and ive told them but they do nothing. Wait staff is always short too so service is slow. 
Overall i continually will drive up from downtown for this place its so good."}
{"text":"We were drawn in by the decent AYCE lunch price and appetite for sushi. Unfortunately it turned out to be one of the worst dining experiences I've had in the city. 

I'm not to typically care or rate a place on service, but this place really sets the benchmark. After filling out the menu we'd wait forever for the food to come, and whenever it did it was someone elses order. I also noticed that the servers were extremely favourable to any asian customers. At first it seemed a coincidence, but after seeing newly seated tables always getting served earlier it was obvious. To top it off, when the food finally came the servers were clearly trying to get us out to seat ppl waiting in line.

All of this would have been tolerable if the sushi made up for it - which it wasn't. The sushi was heavy on rice, and very little fish or taste. No sashimi either."}
{"text":"Friends and I went there yesterday for the $10.99 lunch.

They have lots of different choices of sushi. We ordered 3 times, almost up to 30 different items all together. (My friend's a small dude, big eatter.)

It is a great place for a group meeting"}

There are many AYCE sushi places here in Toronto, lots of them located near Chinatown. Aji Sai being one of them, there are close to 100 items on their menu with over 30 special rolls. Lunch AYCE is about $12 plus tax and with the choice of quality food you get, it def sounds better than regular lunch bento menu. Inside is bright and nicely decorated; actually one of the nicest AYCE restaurants I've been to. Service wise, you have to look around and wave your arms around to catch the eyes of waiters. I felt like they didn't want to help you or purposely avoided eye contact. However, they were helpful once you got their attention if that makes it any better. 

After we ordered food, tempuras and all the fried goodness showed up first (that seems to be the case at many AYCE places). Their nigiris were decent size and the rolls were pretty good. Overall everything was a little bland but for AYCE, I couldn't really complain. My favorite roll was the Black dragon roll and I would recommend ordering all the sushi+rolls first cause eating all the fried stuff first will fill you up real fast and make you feel bloated.

Summary: It was decent for the price I paid, but if I ever find a better AYCE place I wouldn't go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"I am just visiting Toronto but would probably come here often if I lived here. Good food. Good service. Good price."}
{"text":"I have to start off with that the first time I went to this place, it was great. I thought the food was good for an all you can eat sushi joint. Service was mediocre. That being said, I didn't mind going back for a catch up with one of my girlfriends. Unfortunately, this time - it was horrible. 

1. If you're going for lunch - DON'T. The selection was minimal. 
2. If you plan on eating sushi that tasted nothing like fish but like something that was soaked in salt water and plan on wanting to be extremely dehydrated from the saltiness - order the smoked salmon roll. It was absolute garbage. 
3. If you plan on eating sushi that is tasteless - order everything else. 
4. The salmon sushi was warm and tasted really old - so I'm sure that's a health concern. 
5. Service was horrible. The waitresses gave you attitude if you even managed to wave one down. They tried to ask my gf and I to pay for the leftover stale sushi per regular price because we had a lot left over. But granted, i was not going to stuff myself with bland warm sushi rolls or increase my risk of high blood pressure from their salty rolls (refer to #2, #3 and #4) Thus, I had to convince them that it was nearly impossible to finish.
As we were eating, they swept the floor. 
And any table side manners were non existential. 

With all of that said, if you feel like possibly poisoning yourself with warm raw fish on a piece of old seasoned rice that either tasted too salty or too bland, if you feel like being ignored by waitresses until it is time to pay your bill and if you feel like having them sweep the floor while you eat - this is your go to place :)"}
{"text":"Wow, what a different experience it was after not having visited Aji for a month or two: unfortunately it's taken a turn for the worst.

The staff that was on-site consisted of people I've never seen before. That would be fine if they treated us accordingly. For some reason they say us down at a table that was not only still wet, but they never gave us utensils or plates. All we had was our menus and a piece of paper with a template on it to make our order on (which was new to us, as previously they would take our orders throughout the visit instead of having it placed on paper). They set all the tables around us after we placed our order, but not for our table. I made eye contact with at least 3 of the staff, and they just kept walking. I finally managed to get the attention of one of them, and m'lady asked them for chopsticks, so a short while later we were given our chopsticks and plates (this was after they had already served m'lady her soup and salad and I was still waiting for my soup).

The sushi rolls had an immense amount of avocado on them, and it was almost all we could taste. I got to the point of feeling sick to my stomach from all the avocado.

Since we had to place basically our entire order from the beginning, we got a huge plate of sushi, of which we ended up not being able to finish 6 pieces. They didn't charge us for those, which was nice. Typically we'd be ordering bit by bit, and that would make gauging how much we were able to have much more easily.

For dessert, m'lady got jello (they only had mango flavor, which was the kind she actually preferred), which was not settled. My egg pudding was very good as usual.

So all-in-all, I might try them again, but I'll definitely be a bit hesitant to be doing so anytime soon."}
{"text":"Horrible attitude from waiter, they seem like did not hear your request.  all the seafood seems like unfresh and they will fine you for not finishing it.  This place is not even clean as a normal resturant, bleach smell while you eat. 

I wish Health Canada is aware of this situation.

I will never recommend this place to anyone and I will never go back again."}
{"text":"Great AYCE. The food came very quickly, was well prepared and the staff were all very helpful. The assortment of sushi was decent but not extraordinary. The restaurant was quite busy, which fostered a loud, fun and vibrant atmosphere. The prices are decent; the AYCE is $25/person."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch AYCE with some coworkers and we were treated with such horrible attitude by every single server here. This is my second time coming here since a few years ago when I was in shock after seeing a cockroach on the wall, but my coworkers all decided to come for a quick bite, so why not give them another chance.. 

For almost $15 after tax, Aji Sai's AYCE menu does not offer any sashimi, but instead plenty of cooked food. The roll selection was decent but none of them had a description explaining what the heck a Fireman Roll is.. 

Our server, Shirley, had the worst attitude. Her face was made of rock, and gave us a look of disdain when we asked for the menu again. Our dishes were pretty much 'thrown' at us.. and when it came time to pay, they were even more annoyed that we needed to get separate bills. She also tried to charge us $1 for every two pieces of sushi we couldn't finish. I was upfront and told her that the fish did not taste fresh and that none of us could eat that roll and she still insists that it's company policy. I was super frustrated at this point because the food was horrible and the service was even worse.. 

Don't order the following:
1. Wakame Salad - The seaweed is extremely dried out. You'll think you're eating grass.
2. Saury - This fish was so burnt & bitter I had to spit it out. It tasted like cancer, with the scales and a million tiny fish bones. 
3. Fried tofu - You'd think this was crispy since it's fried, but NOPE it's soggy like wet socks and very bland to the taste. 
4. Fish cake - Equally as soggy as the fried tofu, but has a distinguished fishy smell. I think the fish paste needed to be cooked longer. 
5. Any roll that has tempura bits in it - the roll will be 80% tempura bits. 

To sum up my experience here: 
1. Horrible Service - Don't come here and get stressed out by these extremely rude servers. 
2. Horrible Food - Even for lunch AYCE, don't waste $15 on this..
3. Never coming back. I'm sure cockroaches still live here."}
{"text":"The only sushi restaurant I go to regularly - the sushi and sashimi are always delicious, the selection is fabulous, and it's impossible for anywhere that isn't AYCE to compare to the price. When Aji Sai opened, I was working just down the street, so I visited frequently. Years later, Aji Sai is a special treat, and I'll make a trip to the area when I have a sushi craving. The other locations don't compare - this is the one I'll always come back to."}
{"text":"Came here on Easter Monday - AYCE sushi and sashimi dinner. Specialties include teppanyaki and dishes from the wok like General chicken and sweet and sour chicken.

Service is very attentive and quick although they have missed our orders twice. 

Raw seafood is very fresh. Sushi rolls are superb and presentation is good but some pieces fell apart! One thing I really like about the rolls is that they don't usually use too much rice so the meat-to-rice ratio is just right, not too filling and so you can sample more. 

I especially liked the teppanyaki steak - the meat is so tender it almost melted in my mouth!

If you order mackerel (saba) always eat it fresh, it turns a bit fishy and even more sour after a while.

Dessert specialty is the egg pudding and fried banana a la mode. my personal favorite however is the green tea ice cream.

Environment is very comfortable and perfect for a gathering with friends, or just a private impromptu. Nice decor, very clean and new.

Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Good option if you want to eat a lot of sushi in a fast dinner. 
Although they don't have something high quality sushi..you can have enough sushi to finish really full. 
I like grilled squid menu here,too.
It's a restaurant spacious so good for large group. Service was good."}
{"text":"First visit to this place and it was thanks to the GF for finding it on Yelp.

Didn't get off to a good start.  When we walked in the hostess was out to lunch - mentally speaking.  We were standing there as she was we just looking around and I had to break the ice and ask for a table or two.

Once we were seated, we were lucky enough to have. Waitress named YoYo who was amazing! Very attentive and friendly.

The sushi here is amazing, especially the Firehouse roll.  We had he dinner buffet for $21.95 and everything was fresh and made to order so nothing was sitting around.  It was also was great as they don't over pack it with rice.  They also serve red tuna as opposed to the cheaper white tuna.

BUT, the best thing was the cheese wantons!  A wanton deep fried with cream cheese inside cooked to a golden brown served with sweet and sour sauce.  Must have had four orders of that alone in addition to a bunch of sushi.  I used to live in San Francisco and discovered them out there but since I have been back have not found a place that makes them up until now.   They are a must have!"}
{"text":"very disappointed.

all the dish is just horrible and inedible. we order mostly from the kitchen, it was just bland and hard to chew on. the pad thai we order taste like ketchup, chicken teriyaki and veal chop is very hard to chew on and have zero flavour to it, noodle and soup is bland. egg sushi is fine, bcuz egg is sweet but the soy sauce is way too salty.

one star for waitress who is nice and didn't do anything wrong, also bcuz of the dessert.

the only good thing about the restaurant is their dessert, tiramisu is the BEST!! regret not ordering more tiramisu and the ice-cream.

never been to an ayce sushi restaurant that their dessert is better than their food.

NEVER GOING BACK"}
{"text":"BEST EVER! I always order from aji sai Danforth when I'm tryna get me some good soosh. I've never had a bad experience with them and give them the thumbs up to all my friends/ argue to order them instead of stupid pizza. Keep rocking aji sai and thanks for the blessed dinner special!!!"}
{"text":"I came here twice and both times it was pretty below average. The service was good because it's always dead inside. Max 3 tables of customers and 5 employees!

The food itself I would give 2/5 stars. The sashimi did not taste fresh. The sushi was very poorly made and didn't have much flavour like you couldn't even tell the difference between the several Maki rolls you ordered. The dessert was the usual ice cream options. Which had freezer burn because there was small ice pieces in my green tea ice cream and in other ice creams too. 

While we were eating, one of the employee was sweeping and mopping. Which really put me off and made me lose my appetite."}
{"text":"I don't think AYCE sushi is my thing. I always feel sick and the food feels heavy in my stomach.

(I think my stomach is sensitive/picky and needs REALLY fresh sushi, not AYCE sushi)

That said, this is probably the best AYCE out of all of the ones out there. Quite fresh, good portions, very fast and tasty for the most part (although not as good as if you pay for an actual meal, and I am not sure you really economize when you do AYCE seeing as you don't really eat more than what you can pay for in a regular restaurant).

Even so. If you like AYCE, head here!"}
{"text":"Great all you can eat. Good service and an easygoing atmosphere. You could bring a date or a buddy here and comfortably pig out together.

Beware the line up and stay away from the overpriced and terrible stocked wine list, but otherwise, enjoy."}
{"text":"Great all you can eat sushi in Toronto. $15.99 lunch price is very reasonable and the menu is quite diverse. I would highly recommend making a reservation in advance. The staff was very friendly and the food itself was very good."}
{"text":"I was just here an hour ago! The food was delicious. They had a good selection for all you can eat. The fish was fresh but not he freshest I've had. Waitresses were nice even though it was a busy night. The only thing I don't like was the fact that the tip was \"fixed\" meaning the tip is already included in your bill when they give it to you. I did not know at first (it doesn't say on the bill) and I thought they were over charging me. I asked the manager and he said that tip was included. Honestly I didn't like that because it doesn't allow customers to choose how much tip to give even if the service is bad. Overall the restaurant is good and I will come again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are visiting from VA, U.S.A. and our relatives brought us here tonight. One word: Superb!!! This is the best Sushi buffet we have ever experienced living on the east coast, thus far. From salad and soup to incredible entree dishes/rolls and ending with delicious ice cream for dessert. Hands down top quality food! If you have a special occasion or a large group, this is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"As we were waiting for our food I watched as two bus boys cleared a table. No big deal until one of the bus boys took a half drunken cup of water from the dishes they were clearing, dumped the water out on the table and proceeded to wipe the table down with it. Not sure what health code officials would say about that. Based on that alone I will not be returning and will caution friends about going here as well. Gross.
Service is rude and slow."}
{"text":"They charge people for remaining food and without letting u know first ur comming in."}
{"text":"I felt like beer so for \"date\" night with my bf, I wanted to go to the Wild Wings location on Bayview Ave. But then, my bf said he didn't feel like wings, rather sushi. And as luck would have it, there was an AYCE place right beside Wild Wings. I wasn't expecting much, but I knew they would have beer so I was more than happy to try out a new place.

Intro. It was pretty busy at 7pm. There are these private booth areas that line the walls, but it appears they only place large groups. For once, I would NOT want to sit in a booth area because it would be harder to flag down the waiters to place your orders. I saw one guy continually get in and out of his booth to get service.

Actually, a couple of staff came to our table right from the start to take our items. We ordered a variety of typical sushi items: hand rolls, chicken teriyaki, eggplant (which was really good!), fried vegetables (tempura) and we also ordered two types of entirely forgettable and chewy sashimi. Everything is per item and the menu makes references to charging for all pieces unfinished. I get it...just because this is all you can eat, it doesn't mean it's all you can waste. For dessert, we ordered Green Tea and Mango ice cream (yum) and Mango jello (not yum).

Towards the latter part of the evening, service was slower and harder to find. You really have to look out for staff to either order more or get the bill. Either way, my benchmark was set low that I knew what I was getting into. 

So, having said that, I would not come out of my way to eat here. If it weren't for the fact that my bf and I made a split decision to have sushi outside the wings place (and they were beside each other), I wouldn't come here at all. The particular night I went was family night I guess because every family coming in or already sitting down brought their baby along with strollers and carriages. And everyone was talking in baby voice. Gah...

For 18.99/person on weeknights, I don't know if that is a good price or not. I guess if you ordered sashimi galore it would be. The total bill for two people including booze and tips came out to be $70 and change so pretty average. Not a place I would take my date or family, but it might be a good place for groups if you happen to be in the area and feeling like AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"Ambience was wonderful.  We were in a private dining area which allowed the 8 of us to carry on 4 or 5 different conversations and know and hear what was being said. 
Food was fabulous.  Dishes were presented beautifully and we did receive everything that was ordered without needing to ask numerous times. 
Wait staff checked in to gauge our satisfaction and progress.  
Grilled salmon was a hit, as was the beef and the salmon tataki. Shrimp, ribs, sushi and rolls all were great. Salads were very tasty. 
In fact our table comments included consistently delicious (from us who were there many previous times), to a declaration of \"My new favorite sushi place\" from our newbie friends who joined us. 
Great menu with excellent variety. 
Enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"Relatively speaking, it is the better of the AYCE sushi restaurants in downtown Toronto. Service is quick, menu is decent and the quality is decent for AYCE. One cannot compare this to an a la carte restaurant as it is comparing apples to oranges. Aji Sai does use MSG in their food given that I felt severely dehydrated within half hour of our meal and had to down several cups of water. To be fair, I'm pretty sure all AYCE sushi  restaurants use MSG."}
{"text":"After seeing lines out the door for this place every weekend, I figured it had to be good. Interesting what people will do for AYCE. I guess growing up in Michigan where Golden Corral and Old Country Buffet were the norm, I have always been jaded by realizing that,  \"you get what you pay for\" and \"your eyes are always bigger than your stomach\". 
So, one night when I wanted sushi take out, I ordered two rolls off the special take-out menu. The regular menu apparently has all the stuff that comes with the AYCE.  
I returned with rental DVD in hand and got my two rolls. I had scanned the menu for a roll that didn't contain \"fried\" in the description. They almost all have friend shrimp rolled up in them. 
However, I failed to realize one of the rolls I ordered didn't contain fried items, it was deep friend- whole! 
Argh- not even filling, more than $15 for two rolls and fried. 
Unless I marry someone who will take advantage of the AYCE- I guess the Cliche's just can't keep me away- I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Giving 2 out of 5 seems a bit harsh but the \"I've experienced better\" description is really spot on. The selection here is pretty standard, the food is OK, service I found to be on the slow side. On the plus, parking is well adequate and the interior is nice and cozy. It's a convenient and easy place to go to and that's probably the main reason I'd come here again. 

In one word, Average."}
{"text":"Majority of the time if I am in a Japanese restaurant it would be for the AYCE sushi menu.

This one is rated as one of the better ones when people recommend it but after a few visits now it is just okay.

The menu is good enough with a good selection but does not beat some of the other choices nearby."}
{"text":"Overall: decent food, good value... horrible service. 

This is a nice place to go when you're craving sushi and really hungry. The decor of the restaurant is nice, and they have an extensive selection of sushi as well as many other dishes. I recommend the spicy salmon,  green and black dragon rolls... and DO NOT recommend the sushi with banana in it . Forgot what it was called, but there was no mention of banana, and I totally did not expect that. Ugh. 
In general, the sushi was pretty good. One of the better ones, for the price.

The service was not good though. We asked for refills for our tea.... about 5 times... and it never came. It took quite a while for us to get our ordered food as well. I've never experienced such poor service in a restaurant before-- but at least the staff was not outright rude. It was more like they ignored/forgot about you."}
{"text":"Went here at the urging of my husband before attending a musical. Had high hopes for this restaurant but I was very sadly mistaken. The staff is all over the place and no one has any idea what table ordered what and you never get the same server so it is impossible to follow up on your order.
For my first selection I ordered a variety of sashimi and it was fairly tasty, but nothing special. When I ordered my second selection (my entree) I waited for 20 minutes trying to get the staffs attention to inquire what was taking so long, turns out the server threw my order out for some unknown reason even to her. First and last time I will ever eat at this sushi chain."}
{"text":"Great sushi place in downtown Toronto for AYCE before 3:30. Never gone after that but it's pretty good for the money."}
{"text":"I give it 4 stars because as far as AYCE sushi goes...it's the best. The service still sucks but the food is good and the menu is huge. I dont remember everything but some of the highlights

Good
Cheese wontons- we didnt actually order but what an amazing mix up
Philly roll- smoked salmon and cc cant go wrong
deep fried banana with ice cream- everyone had seconds

Bad
Cowboy roll- beef teriyaki roll without any sauce
The roll wiht the banana- banana and sushi is a no go in my books
BBQ salmon belly- not my cup of tea"}
{"text":"Meh, neither here or there. This is your typical AYCE spot, with mediocre sushi and slow service. It wasn't terrible, and since the bar for AYCE sushi is so low, I'm gonna give it 3 stars for being just \"alright.\""}
{"text":"I thought that the food quality was very poor.  The fish egg roll wrapped in nori was not wrapped, and the fish soup was only the fatty brown part of salmon (no other type of seafood) and too salty.  As well, I asked what the BBQ fish was and was told they did not know.  It was a sardine fish with head cut in half.  Worse,  my friend and I ordered a couple of things when we sat down but the staff (because there were 4 young Japanese men serving us) kept trying to take them away.

There's no al a carte menu.  As well, you have a 90 minute maximum and are told on the menu that you'll have to pay for anything you do not eat.  Considering there are no prices given b/c they only do all-you-eat, who knows what they would charge.

The decor was very nice though and if you are going out with a big eater, this might be a great choice.

I went on a Saturday afternoon in November at 12:30 pm, and there was no line up.  By 1 pm, there was a line up of about 10 people."}
{"text":"Went for AYCE. Decent place, extremely mediocre, aint that fresh. For the lunch price its a good place to have lunch and be full for the rest of the evening. Went for dinner once and the menu was not much of an upgrade for the price you pay."}
{"text":"The worst bang for the buck of all the AYCE sushi places.  Fish wasn't fresh, was tasteless, and most of their sushi is pre-made.  It's impossible to have that much sushi come assembled to your table in 90 seconds.  The Bloor/Yonge location is much better."}
{"text":"I have to say with all the AYCE sushi places I've been to in the downtown area so far, this one kind of stuck out for me. In a good way!

Let's start with the presentation/layout. Pretty modern and interesting. Service isnt too bad and the place seems to be popular because it was busy when we got there, but then again it WAS dinner time haha ;) 

Food came out in a timely manner with no screw ups and food quality was actually pretty decent. The sashimi were all pretty fresh and I LOOOVE the wakame salad aside from the overload of dressing thats put in it and the surprise of lettuce underneath it.

It has a pretty comfortable atmosphere where friends and family can easily come here to enjoy some good food and have a good time. I would definitely come back here if I got the chance!"}
{"text":"Love the sushi ...this place is very nice and fish is fresh . Seats are little too comfortable so I would take the table . 
Absolute must to eat the spicy salmon and butterfish rolls . The people over there are doing a great job and service was very fast . Highly recommended ."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times usually for lunch. They have AYCE and its very reasonably priced. It's about $14 for lunch and a few bucks extra on weekends. 
 
I don't really expect a lot when its AYCE but this place is pretty darn good. It gets busy so you might want to make a reservation. The sushi is fresh and the quality is good. The service is average and the food may take a while when its busy. If you don't want to splurge and satisfy your daily sushi cravings, this is a good place. For some fine sushi dining, look for my other reviews."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a week day

Pros 
Place is renovated and looks nice. 

Cons
VERY slow service 
Food is bland
At $17/person for all you can eat there are many better places in the area."}
{"text":"AYCE that is decent quality is hard to come by these days - Aji Sai was no different. I remember when all-you-can-eat was such a great bang for buck, the varieties were great and the large group was so happy - especially the kids.

The one advantage to taking kids (of a reasonable age) to AYCE is that they will take care of themselves. The waiters will serve them, everything you can pick off the menu is already included in the price, and there is no concern of there being not enough of anything. My little cousins were veterans - knew exactly what they wanted and only that, with no room for error. The rest of us browsed the two-page list slowly and debated over sashimi counts, maki rolls, and appetizers. Overall, nothing was horribly bad, yet I struggle to say anything was good at all. The sashimi was limp, the rolls all tasted like California rolls, and the various appetizers were drenched in the exact same watered-down sub-par teriyaki sauce. I was told the hand rolls were horrid with chewy seaweed.

All that said, quite a number of people were visiting on a Friday night - I suspect it was due to the convenience of accommodating large groups and varying appetites, and many tables had many children.

I won't be back! Unfortunate, given the plaza is actually a prime location that could be so much more..."}
{"text":"This restaurant delivers a decent AYCE for 13bucks. It's not the best in town but it's pretty decent and surprisingly fresh. But if you want a better restaurant, it's better to scratch yourself for a bit more money."}
{"text":"In my opinion, one of the best all you can eat sushi restaurants in Toronto.

Lunch is $12.99 and has a decent selection. Dinner is $21.99 and has much, much more to offer. If you come hungry and you lay off the rice, you can definitely get your money's worth here. The service is usually pretty good and they do a good job at remembering what you've ordered (unlike many other AYCE sushi places I've visited).

They have a huge selection of sashimi, nigiri, all sorts of special maki rolls, hot dishes, soups and salads. The back of the menu also has a very useful description of all of their special rolls so that you can figure out what's in each of them.

I've been half a dozen times and the fish has always been very fresh, especially the sashimi, which is how sushi should be enjoyed.

Personal favourite: Butterfish sashimi
Coolest combo roll: Firehouse roll (spicy tuna with banana)

I recommend a bowl of miso soup and some gyoza to get your taste buds rolling, then move on to the delicious sushi. Be warned though, all that rice will start filling your tummy after a while, so try to eat less of it if you want to try as many types of sushi as possible."}
{"text":"Best AYCE in downtown Toronto from experience. But that isn't saying much.......  

Need to expand the menu, order from I pad, and the front door always let's in a freezing cold breeze in the winter and doesn't stay closed. Get it fixed."}
{"text":"My Favouite AYCE sushi place in Toronto. 
Food is fresh and comes incredibility fast!
I'm a regular and I always receive decent service. 
Sometimes, it's tough to get the waitress' attention for more tea."}
{"text":"yes yes im a big fan all you can eat sushi and hand rolls this is the place okay sometimes you have to wait in line but its a great place and everyone wants to eat sushi so you got to have patients and wait service is fast and they dont try to kick you out as long as you eat and i can eat 

try it you wont be sorry"}
{"text":"I was honestly a big fan of this place. $23.99 for unlimited sushi WHICH INCLUDES sashimi and Nigiri. I've never been to an unlimited sushi places that allows you to get sashimi!! I was also a huge fan of this Salmon Rose thing- two pieces of salmon wrapped around rice with a dollop of aoili on top. It was a great rice to salmon ratio.

The rolls we ordered were meh, nothing special. The dynamite role was fine. The excellent role was actually pretty bad, despite the description sounding good. I was not a fan of the butterfish on top, even though I love butterfish.

My only complaint was the service. We ordered a lot of items that never came, and were brought some things we did not order. 

Got sake hot sake and saparo as well.

Overall, would come back and get so many salmon rose things and sashimi slices."}
{"text":"Honestly this restaurant was pretty cheap and good years ago but then the service got really bad and the food became really crap. 
I was here for lunch one day and this one waiter was staring at me the entire time because I was taking the sushi apart and only eating the fish part at first and he came over to tell me I would have to pay for the rice balls I didn't eat. I told him I am going to eat the rice but with my teriyaki chicken or beef or smth because unlike traditional sushi where the fish is supposed to drape and cover the rice, the lunch buffet sushi here was like a ginormous rice ball with a fish condiment on top. It's impossible to eat like regular sushi. 
Anyway.  The waiter kept on staring and came over 2 more times to warn me. It was like eating in jail or smth.  At the end I ate everything and he went on with his life. Worst experience ever. I would never step in that place again after how I was treated."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible, terrible.  I just find it absolutely atrocious that people line up to eat this awful food.  Yes, it's cheap.  It's cheap cuz it's cheap!!!  The quality is sub-par.  It's a disgrace of a \"Japanese\" restaurant if there ever was one."}
{"text":"How is this place still opened? The food here is disgusting. Left after 3 dishes in on ayce. The sushi isn't even fresh. Everything is brown! Worst service ever!"}
{"text":"For years this was our go to take out and delivery joint in the neighbourhood.  Our office was within delivery range and I can't remember a week pass by without a large group of us ordering in Aji Sai for lunch. 

 The staff was always friendly, the food affordably priced and competently prepared, served up in sizes that satisfied.  But those days have slowly slipped away.   The trouble started right about the time they remodeled the interior of the restaurant.  Perhaps they over spent, and had to start cutting corners?  I hate to speculate but something happened.  Something not good.

The quality of the meat and fish was the first thing we noticed going.  Then it was the flavour of their sauces.  Then the care put into presentation.  Within six months a place I totally adored eating became a restaurant that, after two questionable stomach issues after eating there, I've sworn off forever.  It breaks my heart to \"two star\" a familiar haunt like Aji Sai but I hope that if enough people speak up, Aji Sai will recapture its glory days and go back to what made them a neighborhood staple...quality food at a good price.  For now, if you want good Japanese...don't go to Aji Sai."}
{"text":"With all the AYCE sushi places in Toronto, there is a lot of competition these days.  This place used to be great and on the top of my list when it came to good all you can eat sushi and sashimi, but as of late it has gone a bit downhill.

The last time I was here with a party of about 10 people, the service was extremely slow and we were even given a time limit for our meal.  We never met the time limit deadline, but it felt strange to be given a limit before our meal even started!

The food was alright and the sushi was definitely better than their cooked food.  The sashimi was not as fresh as it could have been and there were pieces of salmon that tasted a bit on the frozen side.   On the up side, the menu selection is huge and there is something for everyone on the menu.  I really liked the dessert iced cream and pudding on the menu, which is always a nice treat before leaving. 

Overall great for the price and I will come back again in the future."}
{"text":"Was looking for an AYCE sushi and came across this one on queen st! The place was not busy so it was not hard to get a seat, and there were a lot of workers so was helped out not too long after. I wish I took a picture of the menu to show how easy it is to choose from the wide selection of rolls, as there were pictures for every sushi, and it was all on one sheet so def easy too read! The service was quick, I really enjoyed the cheese wontons, and found myself to keep ordering more. Ordered Philadelphia rolls, shrimp tempura rolls, crab rolls, to name a few  and was impressed by the quality/freshness. Also liked how in the dessert menu they offered other dessert such as cheesecake and tiramisu so it wasn't just ice cream! Overall I liked the atmosphere and service at this sushi place, and would recommend if you are looking for sushi place that offers AYCE!"}
{"text":"This place was closed due to renovations from a fire but it is now open. The decor is upgraded and looks classy. Same great sushi and service has improved ."}
{"text":"ok so if u are in mood for some none authentic fast produced pseudo japanese food, this is it! 
It's cheap and they have a huge variety of food u can choose from. 
I normally just stick with the rolls and sushi as their meats are pretty gross, mysterious and prepared poorly."}
{"text":"Been here several times with different people and different numbers.

SERVICE:
Usually, the service is quite good, but only when they are not busy. 

Came in today and the place was over 1/2 full. Because of the rain, the place filled up quickly and was almost full within 30 minutes. They brought out a couple more staff, which was good, but food was constantly being sent to the wrong table (usually 1 or 2 tables away), or the server kept asking if we ordered the item they were about to put on our table, or the server got confused as to which table was supposed to get what. 

Overall service was slow, and not everything that was ordered came to the table. I would suggest to anyone visiting here to take a picture of your order with your phone so that you have proof if you don't receive everything.

As well, desserts were served before some mains.

FOOD:
Quality was not bad overall, but there were a few small problems:
\"Excellent Roll\" had a smoky flavour that was not described on the menu - possibly the tobiko.
\"Mango Tango\" roll had spicy sauce on top instead of mango sauce.
\"Deep Fried Chicken Udon\" was just that - chicken with udon noodles and some seaweed - no vegetables.
\"Beef Skewer\" were overcooked, although almost easy to chew.

WHY STARS WERE REMOVED:
1 star off immediately for removing the wine/beer/sake menu as soon as tea was served. Lose-lose situation as they lost on extra potential revenue and loss on us customers for possibly having a better time / experience. Maybe they thought we looked underage, but we would have produced ID if they had asked.

1 star off for service and food issues. We also noticed that a couple who had come in at the same time as us were seated several minutes after us and were completely ignored, so they left."}
{"text":"The food tasted decent but was not fresh. Even the ginger and wasabi was not fresh, and the miso soup tasted off. The server was a bit rude to us at the end and my girlfriend got food poisoning afterwards."}
{"text":"This is the worst AYCE Sushi place downtown.

I love love love sushi and the quality at Aji Sai is poor compared to other places like Sushi D. I went in for lunch with my friend while we did some shopping and we arrived before the lunch rush just as they opened. Once our order was placed and the food came I thought the sushi was edible but not great. The gyoza was just again ok. Everything was just ok. But what made this place one star was the staff. I felt like we were being hurried out of the restaurant once we started eating. I felt like they didnt want me to order more (and its all you can eat) and I kept being asked if I wanted the bill. NO actually I will let you know when I want the bill.

Like I appriricate you want to flip tables at lunch but like I seriously wasnt being slow or anything.

Save your money, go up to college st and go to Sushi D. Its much better quality and the servers don't rush you through your meal."}
{"text":"The all you can eat menu is great!  $13.99 for lunch and $20 for dinner.  

The service was not great.  They forgot to bring out a 2 dishes and had to ask several times in order to get it. 

The fish was fresh and all of our food was delicious."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER.

Being an AYCE sushi joint, I was not expecting excellent service, but the service I received here was so ridiculous it's laughable. When we requested for some utensils (which should have been provided) for a party of 4, the waiter brought back only one. When we asked for additional utensils for the rest of our group, the waiter stalked off shaking his head in disbelief as if we were so demanding. During our meal, when I asked for more ginger, the waiter returned, placed down the ginger, and sarcastically added \"happy?\" 
Honestly, I'm guaranteed better service at a McDonald's."}
{"text":"the most amazing sushi restaurant on earth. eat plates of food and they say nothing then bring you a measly bill hahaha i love it. best ever!!!!"}
{"text":"After today's bad experience, I just have to lean towards 4/10 overall. 3/10 for the service, 5.5/10 for the food.

To start, they missed our first sushi/sashimi order. We were waiting while we saw the chef standing there idle. We thought \"shouldn't he be working on our sushi?\". We suspected that they missed our sushi order.  Then we saw our next table, who came and ordered after us, receive their sashimi. We told them to check our order. So instead of putting a rush on our order cuz they missed it, our next table got more of their sushi. And the server was not apologetic about it either. So yes, they missed our order. We had to wait another few moments for our sushi to arrive,

On to our food. Was kinda disappointed when the sushi orders came. Food in general was \"meh\". Scallop sushi was warm, like it was cooked. Texture was also very off. Having been to Aoyama (comparing ayce with Aoyama is just silly, but I digress) and having had their scallop sushi, scallop at ajisai was just wrong.

-Squid sashimi was decent for ayce.
-Oyster roll had a decent amount of oyster in it. Tasted good.
-Salmon sashimi was between decent and unremarkable (as expected in ayce), as were other sashimi.
-Cooked food were better. Shrimp tempura was good. Beef roll, ribs, and teriyaki beef were good.
-Dessert was the best part (only because its the hardest to screw up)

I only came to ajisai cuz I was somehow craving ayce sushi and ichimoto in Richmond hill was closed. From now on I will just stick with non-ayce like Aoyama, Miyabi, and Le Cafe Michi (last week's toro combo at miyabi was amazing)."}
{"text":"This Aji Sai location has its pros and cons. It doesn't offer all-you-can-eat like many of their other locations, but their hot special, salmon special, and dinner special options are a great value. I find their sushi rolls to be a bit on the small side (the hot special being an exception!), but I do love their vegetable sushi combo. It's a great option for a healthy take-out meal in a pinch. Not a big fan of their udon or teriyaki, but their tempura and Aji-dashi tofu are tasty. The staff are always very warm and friendly."}
{"text":"WARNING: STAY AWAY! DO NOT EAT HERE!
(Is there a way I can rate this below a zero star?!)

Normally, I would jump for joy when it's all-you-can-eat sushi and I'm shocked I consumed the food, but lucky enough for Aji Sai Restaurant, they only remembered to give us green tea toward the end of our meal.

BLEACH! No not BLEH, not BLECH or not even BLAH, but BLEACH!

Our green tea smelled like bleach. Wtf? And sadly, I only made this discovery after taking a sip of the soapy flavoured concoction. My throat still hurts.

I can't believe I smiled as I interacted with the staff.  Somebody needs to give this place some tough love cuz their food is garbage.  How is this place so gawd damn busy?! These people have obviously never tried mediocre (yes, mediocre blows this place out of the water) Japanese cuisine. Constantly, I kept searching around in disbelief. Were we the only ones with crap on our plates?

Overly oily shrimp tempura and gyoza, limp sushi rolls, the avocado in the rolls was actually an avocado spread. It looked like someone threw up their meal on our sushi pizza and I'm still wondering if that was seaweed salad they served.

What of waste of stomach space. I wish I had starved myself last night instead."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite AYCE sushi restaurant. Not so much for lunch as the menu is kinda limited and not as fresh, but I love it for dinner! Never had to wait longer than 10 minutes for a booth because I always make reservations. The line does get pretty huge, though. Especially on weekends.

The price is pretty good, like others mentioned. Around $14 for lunch and $24 for dinner. Sometimes it's fresher than other times but it's definitely never stale.

The service can be slow at times but 90% of the time, the place is so packed that they keep up with all their orders pretty well. Some of the waiters don't speak the greatest English so sometimes you'll either get something you didn't order, or like 10 pieces of tempura instead of 5. Not complaining though, I always manage to finish it.

I've been to Aji Sai about 50+ times. Absolutely love it. Definitely a regular there and the waiters/staff definitely treat my bf and I as regulars."}
{"text":"Service is always attentive and the sushi is usually well-made for an all-you-can eat place. Love the amount of selection there is as well."}
{"text":"Went for dinner to suppress my craving for sushi. This place did its job. Came to the restaurant around 6pm on a thursday night. It wasn't that busy still some empty tables. Servers were attentive always filling up my tea. It had a great selection to chose from.  Food tasted okay. I would back for another round!"}
{"text":"$12.99 AYCE sushi: better than you think.

I never thought I'd find myself in an AYCE sushi joint, but it happened yesterday over lunch and I was really, pleasantly surprised.

The menu is pretty sizable and all of the food looked and tasted great, especially the green and black dragon. Yum. And the butterfish. Oh man.

The staff, as well, were on top of everything despite the packed house. We didn't have to wait, nor ask for anything."}
{"text":"I will give the food 3 stars. The service is not friendly. Still a good place for Sushi."}
{"text":"Place was pretty packed. Sushi here is always great. The fire house roll is unique and you love it or you hate it. Services was really slow when we went, but recommended."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time. Not the best AYCE restaurant but it was convenient since I'm a frequent queen st dweller. 

I try not to pay too much attention to it but I have to say that the place is not the cleanest. Once you walk in, it smells like a toilet where they try to mask the smell with bleach. They tried to seat me near the toilet once. I refused.

Really huge restaurant. Service is okay. I may come back here if I'm nearby but very unlikely."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst sushi meal I've ever had. The sushi rice was so dry and underseasoned it just tasted like plain rice. Their fried foods were disgusting and tasted really funky. You can definitely tell the oil they use isn't fresh. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"It got better! If you haven't been to Aji Sai in a year, it's time to go back. This place has changed dramatically! Besides the OK service, the menu has become a creative piece of work. There are signature rolls that you probably never heard of at an AYCE. The salmon sashimi was fresh-tasting and not fatty (white lines). It's definitely worth it to go for dinner, which will cost close to $30 a person including tip and tax. 

KEY FEATURES: 
-red tuna 
-muscles 
-scallop 
-nice/clean environment 

Everything tasted really great, but some of the rolls were too warm for my liking and I didn't feel that great after when I got home (if you know what I mean...)"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to have AYCE sushi. I've only been here for lunch and I've always been very happy with the service, the price, and the quality of sushi that they serve. The only little slip up I had at this place was ordering the spider roll. I usually love spider rolls, but their spider roll just tasted a little off. 

Anyways, I definitely get my money's worth at this place. The sushi is great. Often at AYCE sushi places the rice is either mushy, or the rolls are tiny, or they skimp out on the good stuff and make up for it by shoving a heaping amount of avocado in there. One time I dropped by, my waitress just told me to write \"no avocado please\" at the top of the paper and the size of the rolls still stayed the same! amazing! 

Service is really good here. Yeah, the servers don't have perfect english, and some of them can't speak english at all, but if they don't understand you, they give you a big smile and get someone who can help you. I love this place. Pricey for dinner, yes, but totally worth it- I swear. It can get busy here, but service is still top notch and there's plenty of seating available. Loveeeeee it!"}
{"text":"When I worked downtown this is where I go for dinner when im really hungry which is usually all the time. They have alot of creative rolls can't really recall most of it but they have a roll called Fire House Roll which has banana inside and has a sauce with a kick. Go for dinner as most of the rolls are available. I also like their avocado salad and Dynamite Roll. The service however is lacking when it gets busy and they tend to skip alot of orders.

Food- 4/5
Recommendations- Fire House Roll, Dynamite Roll, Cowboy Roll"}
{"text":"Location: 467 Queen Street W Toronto ON M5V
Price: $
Service: ehhhhh

There's so much to say about the restaurant! Let's start off with the positive... Their interior design is really nice; one side is all you can eat, the other side is à la carte. You can say it was a cute setting. 

I was not pleased with the restaurant at all. So, on to the food. We ordered teriyaki chicken, katsu, sashimi, and a monster roll. The terror begins with the fact that my friend had found a bug (to be precise a fly) in her salad... Then we told them about the issue; they had the audacity to tell us something on the line of it being normal thing.. Da faq! I don't know what restaurant would think of it as \"normal\" and then tell my friend she should be okay. NO!! Funny part was that they said she didn't have to worry about paying for her meal.........

Any who... We then get the rest of our orders. The teriyaki chicken was tasteless, blahhh, and not yummy. Katsu was alright- the dipping sauce seemed to be made with sodium alone. The monster roll was alright, it was pretty much tempura assortment roll without the rice. To be short the best part of this was just the sashimi (salmon, surf calm, & mackerel) - especially the mackerel. 

Verdict: If you're hoping to enjoy your meal try again."}
{"text":"The sushi was always fresh for me. Service was always quick but the servers were sometimes very rough in their interactions."}
{"text":"Location: Downtown. Street parking is available [metered] and I'm sure there's a street car that'll get you here if you're using transit. 

The place: Dimly lit and fairly spacious. It doesn't boast a fancy decor but it's nice and cozy.

The goods: I tend to stay away from all-you-can-eat places because personally, I never eat enough to make it worth my while. My date was in the mood for sushi and we were in the area so we came here. The AYCE menu includes appetizers and dessert as well as sushi - so it's a pretty good deal! That said, even though we ordered a variety of different rolls, the outcome was the same - bland. Everything tasted the same which basically meant that everything I ate was lacking in flavour.

Service: OK.

Price point: I think the AYCE menu was $21 + tax, which is pretty good considering everything is included."}
{"text":"Decor is nice and neat. Servers look unhappy except one female server, she was ok. 
Keep in mind there is not only AYCE, they have a la cart menu. Make sure to ask, if u want to try out this place. Sashimi don't look fresh so we only felt comfortable to get their hot dishes. Too bad the management and servers cannot bring out the quality service, as they look grumpy and not able to provide welcoming environment to customers.   No server even came to check out our feedback about their food. Seems not care at all. We cannot tip well because there isn't service to make customers happy except taking orders and deliver our foods. Sorry they lost four stars for giving an overall poor service. 
One star worths for acceptable hot plates.

Return? Nah thank you,  there is a lots of choices out there with way better service and way better fresh food.  Importantly, a pleasant vibe does affect appetites"}
{"text":"I used to love this place for lunch but recently they've changed their menu so now I rather go for dinner. One of my favorite rolls is the sakura roll. They have good salmon, shrimp tempura, and miso soup. The service is not great but for the price, you can't complain. This is one of my favorite places for AYCE sushi in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"The food wasn't fresh and the service was bad. We did get all of what we ordered, they just chose part of the dishes, and I guess not the best ones. The dishes we did get wasn't fresh at all. I will never go there again. NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Hello, my name is Aeryn and I'm a Japanese food addict.

Good, now that's out of the way...

I'm always looking for a new favourite sushi bar, and have not found anything better yet than Aji Sai's all-you-can-eat dinner for about $20 per person (not sure if there's a lesser charge for children).

Their dishes are fresh and delicious and since you can order how much you want served, well proportioned.

The restaurant itself is wonderfully modern-decoed, with soft music.

The wait staff itself is usually good.  An order was once missed, but we didn't mind 'cause it turned out we didn't have room for it anyway.  

The first time I went, our waitress told us that we had a \"last-call\", while we had only been their for roughly 40 mins - not sure if she mistook our table for another that had been there longer...  Our two occasions after that were much longer and there wasn't a difference in food selection, so I'm still a little perplexed about the last call the first time.

But despite that baffling first occasion, I have gone and am planning on going again within the next month.  Another Japanese food addict is coming to Toronto for a weekend in July, and we've already got dinner planned (always willing to enable addictions!)"}
{"text":"Pretty solid quick sushi I like to grab on the go. Friendly staff and service, not the fanciest joint but hey its the danforth and you get a sweet 13% discount when you pickup. Love the Wakame Salad and Spider Roll!!"}
{"text":"I never tried AYCE sushi before coming here so I wasn't sure what to expect, however soon as the first order came to our table I was sold! 

After reading a bunch of reviews here I went expecting bad service and wasn't disappointed in that regard, but given the number of people they have to deal with every day I can't say I'm surprised. It could have been worse! The servers weren't rude or anything, just really busy. Though I did notice they tended to \"forget\" to bring certain orders out toward the end of our visit. 

The food itself was quite good. Again, given the number of people being served it could have been much much worse. The sushi pizza was a bit overdone but otherwise I thoroughly enjoyed everything we tried. 

My favourite sushi place is still Sushi X-tra just down the street but I'm definitely going to come back here for lunch again one day soon."}
{"text":"So impressed with the freshness, speed and service at this establishment. We ordered sashimi, CN Tour roll, Rock and Roll Roll, Green Dragon Roll, Rainbow roll and Sesame chicken. Prices are great!"}
{"text":"Aji Sai is my go to Sunday Lunch destination.
Ever since my friend brought me here, things have never been the same.

Aji Sai is the perfect balance between value and quality.

Their all you can eat is one of the best I've ever had. The menu offers many choices, some better than others. I usually go for the black dragon roll, fire house roll, crunchy spicy salmon roll, yakitori, japanese fried chicken and plate after plate of veal chops.

I just can't get enough of their veal chops! Similar to beef ribs you would find at your favourite Korean restaurant, these are just a bit thicker and...ENDLESS.

Their specialty is the Fire house roll. It's unique because it contains banana in it. Sounds weird, but it's fantastically delicious.

The quality and presentation of the sushi is top notch, considering it's AYCE. The waiters don't mess around either, they come to YOU without you having to flag them down. Insane? I know.

Aji Sai is a tradition that my waistline hates but my wallet truly adores."}
{"text":"One of the better AYCE joints downtown. I like that they keep their fish to rice ratio high, so you don't get full just from rice. Menu is pretty normal but service is quite fast and food is good. They also have caramel pudding at some locations."}
{"text":"Visited Aji Sai on queen street last week after friend and positive reviews on Yelp. I have to say I was impressed with the freshness of the sushi and great value. I wasn't bothered by the luke warm service but who cares as long as they are courteous and listen to what you want. The orders came pretty fast and lines formed quickly. We went mid-week so probably worse on weekends. Only downside is even the \"spicy\" sushi rolls were far from spicy."}
{"text":"Decent all you can eat sushi for the price. Lunch = 15.99, Dinner 23.99. 

The menu is not as vast as some other options in the city, but it's fine for all you can eat. In my opinion although the sushi is decent, the best options are the kitchen items. The Japanese fried chicken was good, general chicken had a great sauce and the vegetable tempura was crispy and tasty (not soggy like other places). 

Overall if your in the area the lunch is worthwhile where dinner is not-so-much."}
{"text":"Don't you love going to a restaurant where they practically fight over picking up your dirty napkins? Well if you've never experienced that service you clearly have not been to Aji Sai yet. As Lindsey said, it's a team effort, we were never left trying to wave a server down. 

The food is excellent - we opted not to pay for the all you can eat, but decided we would get better bang for our buck with some menu items. I immediately gravitated to the Gold Bento with terriaki salmon, beef, or chicken, mixed rolls, soup, tempura crab, and tempura veges (which i replaced with salad. The salmon was large, and I got all of this for around $10. 

If you have a hinkering for some authentic Japanese I recommend Ematei, but if a quick fix is what you're after - Aji Sai is your best bet!

P.S. They give 10% discount if you take out!"}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan of the $10 dinner special cause it is delicious and affordable. However, I haven't been back since last summer. I ate a bad piece of salmon sushi and had a stomach infection for a week. If you go here I would recommend getting the dinner special, but don't eat any raw fish."}
{"text":"As far as AYCE sushi places go, this is a good downtown option. They don't offer the fancy torched sushi or crazy house rolls but they do have all the basics at a very fair price point (~$25 weekend dinner). 

Service was quick and all our orders came out correctly which is rare for an AYCE restaurant. At the counter all the sashimi is pre-cut...kind of odd but I don't mind as it speeds up the service. The sushi unfortunately comes with a lot of rice, but luckily the rolls do not. I like that this menu includes wakame salad, a refreshing change from all the other AYCE that only offer seaweed salad. 

I've been here a few years back and have noticed that the service and quality is significantly better."}
{"text":"This review is a long time coming...

This is the worst experiences I've ever had - and I've been there more than 5 times always giving them the benefit of the doubt. First, they are rude. They always forget items when ordering off the all you can eat menu. It's like they do it to save money. The waitresses like to congregate together or even eat together at a table right in front of you! I feel like getting their attention is like hailing a cab in NYC!

The food is okay once you get it (in parts of your order)... but this review is all about the people. We are huge sushi eaters and this place is officially off my list. I'm done with bad service, waitresses looking the other way and half orders arriving at my table."}
{"text":"Started with a lychee martini and I thought it was delicious! The sashimi was good and tasted fresh. They don't offer tuna sashimi but I was okay with that since I'm a huge fan of salmon and butterfish. The menu has very small pixelated pictures of all the food items but doesn't list what it is. We tried the oyster roll, and CN tower roll and I didn't like either. I loved the hand rolls and the veal cuts! I'm only giving 4 stars because they were inconsistent with quantities even though the menu stated the quantities. For example, we got the cheese wontons and it lists it comes with 2, but we got 3 when we ordered it which was perfect because there were 3 of us at the table. We ordered the same thing during our second round and only got 2. We also ordered the Japanese dumplings (forget the menu name of it) and they forgot to bring it out during the first round of orders so we had to order it again. We noticed once it started getting busy, the service was declining, but nothing unbearable. Went for dinner at 5:45 and was seated immediately. Started getting busy around 6:30. Would definitely come again! A must try AYCE in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"$21 for an AYCE sushi dinner, and I was really impressed by the quality of the sushi rolls.  A lot of the sushi places around here try to make their rolls look bigger by adding more rice than necessary, but Aji Sai had just the right balance between fish, veggies and rice in the rolls I ordered.  I also tried a fresh seaweed salad, and thought the creamy ginger dressing was really unique.  They were a bit slow to refill our water throughout the meal, but brought it when we requested.  I'll go back!"}
{"text":"tonight i ordered a $90 take out (2 dragon rolls +80pcs combined sushi and sashimi the plus 1 stir fried veggies). Got home and find out the quality and portions was so ridiculous and very disappointed!!!! All fishes (salmon and tuna and tai)on sushi was super thin, perhaps as thin as 2mm!!! The basic california rolls not even come with the combo.
how ever it come with 6 tiny pieces of avocado & cucumber rolls. The salmon and tuna sashimi was very thin and tiny too. I Never ever experienced such takeout japanese food in GTA. It's definitely a ripe-off and a shame to run a restaurant like this. 
I do not recommend anyone to try this place at all. and perhaps that's the reason why their customers rated this place 2.5. Spend you money else where!"}
{"text":"THESE PEOPLE, smh.
Was it just the day we came, or what? Was it just the staff we happened to encounter on this day? Even some of the locals told us the service here was trash. Why am I giving it a one star? Because I have to.

So we all ask for straws with our waters, he replies with \"Straws?\" Yes, straws. He looked so confuzzled. We get ONE straw at a table with FOUR people. We told our waiter we needed 3 more and he rolled his eyes and threw the straws across our table. We all looked at each other like, \"Wth?\" 
Are straws too much to ask for? Okay then.

My friend asked for some kind of sauce, he brought it out and said \"Happy?\" and walked off so quick before any of us could put him in his place. The best way to put a waiter like that in their place is to write a big \"0\" where it says tip. We are ones to tip more than necessary if service goes over the top, but in this particular case - it was completely opposite.


Oh and the sushi really wasn't all that.


There's a reason why we didn't give you a tip, asshole. \"Happy?\" 
:-)

To top it off, let me tell you what we did with the sushi we weren't able to finish...we threw all of them into the window of this despicable place :D

HEADS UP: *If you don't finish sushi here during the lunch special, you will have to pay for all of it at regular price*"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. The decor, atmosphere and cleanliness is very good. The plaza has plenty of parking as well.

Service was good, didn't experience any issues or concerns, the dishes were cleared regularly and orders placed accurately.

The food itself on the other hand was lackluster. It's really an average quality for almost everything, not bad but not great either. I suppose for the price they charge it's actually spot on. Menu variety is a positive though. The main issue was I felt they are a bit heavy on rice on all the sushi and rolls. The dinner menu with sashimi is a much better value in my opinion. If you have to order from the lunch menu, skip the Salmon sushi for Salmon Rose as you will get a lot more fish and a lot less rice comparatively.

Would I be back? Probably not as I'm willing to pay more for either better AYCE or A La Carte, but this place is really OK to try out if your expectations aren't very high regarding food quality or taste."}
{"text":"Great service (fast and friendly)! Love the \"all you can eat\" menu. The sushi was great but there was one thing that confused me...

Overall my experience here has always been great. But this is the first time that the rice has been warm. It's a bit of a pet peeve of mine to have warm rice in my sushi. Not just 'room temperature' warm. But more on the steamy, warm side. It was to the point that the sashimi was starting to get really warm too and when sushi gets warm, it's mushy in the mouth! I know this is an on-going debate about how the rice should be: should it be a bit cooler, room temperature or warm-warm? And how warm is warm? It's all perspective at the end of the day. I'm sure it must be hard to get the rice just perfect when it's an \"all you can eat\" environment. Speed and quantity is the key. So considering this huge factor, Aji San is doing a fantastic job! 

In terms of being baby friendly, all the high chairs had working belts and seemed to be clean (I always wipe mine down with a disinfectant wipe anyway, just in case!). 

Would definitely come back again :)"}
{"text":"Her name is Ariel, like the little mermaid we all cherish and love. She's a spectacular waitress with a lovely smile, great mood, and excellent service. Sorry for the girl crush. But she's really the reason why I dine here. She makes the whole experience delightful for myself and my family. 

In addition the sushi is rather delicious. Our favourite menu item is the sushi salad. It's listed under salads, which is deceptive because it's a salad roll. The ingredients are stuffed into thinly sliced cucumber and drizzled with spicy mayo. Try it my fellow sushi lovers. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"IT'S REOPENED NOW.  The restaurant was closed for most of 2015 due to a fire but it just reopened.  Our favourite AYCE sushi place in Richmond Hill / Markham area.  It's been renovated but the prices have gone up a couple of bucks per person.  They now have red tuna on the menu as well as a few other new items!!!  The wakame salad is still the best in town.  The price now includes soda ... don't drink too much or you won't have room for the red tuna!"}
{"text":"I see some people say the service is hit or miss. Well, mine was a miss. It is hands down the worst lunch experience ever in my life. 

I have never felt so insulted when having a meal. After ordering food, we wait a very long time to get the food. When we try to ask the waiter politely what's going on, and if we can have some water, this one waiter would roll his eyes, make grunting noises and show that he's annoyed right in our faces. Lots of attitude from that one waiter, made me wonder why the hell I'm sitting here. I was ready to leave the restaurant, but my table insisted we give them another shot since we already waited so long. We waited a good 40 minutes to get any food.

To be fair, the food is not bad. But would you like to wait forever and feel mistreated to have food that's just okay?"}
{"text":"Service is bad. All sushi and sashimi are fishy. 
Only tempura was okay. i will never return to this place."}
{"text":"The food was decent and the decor is nice, but the thing is the service is horrendous...I've never really given a bad review but this place is far out of the way for me to begin with and it was not worth the drive. I came here with my SO and we were starving. After filling out the form for AYCE, we were given only half the items we ordered. We had to order again on a second sheet. When we were done, we wanted some ice cream and it took over twenty minutes just to wave down a waitress. When we were paying it came out to 56 something for both of us and the man behind the counter kept repeating \"56 without tip. Without tip. Without tip\" and kept pushing me to add more money for the tip. I thought it was rather rude and I'm quite a generous tipper to begin with, but not if the service was lacking as much as it was. Its a gratuity, shouldn't be asked for like that and then scoffed at when we tipped a little this time around. It's not a necessity. Suffice to say, never coming back because of the poor service and the rude attitudes we received."}
{"text":"Not at all one of the best all you can eat sushi joints that I've been to. The food was okay at best. There was nothing special or standout about this place. They don't even have the Ipad's for ordering like a lot of the other places do. The menu was pretty basic and didn't really offer anything spectacular.

It wasn't the worst and it wasn't the best. This was just a truly mediocre experience, I would go back if it was close by and if it was lunch time, but I would probably find somewhere else if I had to go for dinner since the price really isn't worth it."}
{"text":"I live literally 2 mins away from this place and I can say that's the only reason I still go from time to time, even though I despise it. 

Their AYCE is $21 on the weekend and it sucks. First of all, in my opinion 21 is a little much for AYCE anyway, but what irritates me more is that the sushi is bland and borderline falling apart. That's why it comes out so fast. And it's the exact same if you order regular take-out on any average weekday, so it's not like they save the garbage for AYCE. 

The service sucks. There aren't enough waitresses and maybe that's the reason why they're so disorganized and unattentive. I'm almost a doormat when it comes to wait staff for fear of being that person who's rude to the waiter, but don't come to my table once every half hour and say \"sorry we're really busy\". Not my problem. You know this place is busy every Friday so get your shit together and hire more people or learn to deal with the volume properly. My dad complained so the owner came over and was very kind and apologetic, so there's a star.

The seats are comfortable. There's another star."}
{"text":"I came here once before and had a so-so experience but thought I would give it another chance since others seem to like it. I should have stayed away.

The menu is quite large, although they've just changed the order sheet so none of the numbers match. Not a big deal though.

What was a big deal was that the food was pretty bad. We started with edamame, which was wasn't even cooked, and then moved on to handrolls. The salmon handroll was okay but the crispy spicy scallop handroll was all crispy with no scallop, as was the crispy spicy scallop maki. The red dragon roll had tiny, paper thin slices of salmon on top, and the seafood soup was mostly seaweed with the trimmings off their sushi salmon (long thin slices that were mostly the grey layer that comes between the 'meat' and the skin. And the butterfish sashimi was still frozen.

The salmon sashimi and the salmon rosettes were really the only things saving this from being a 1-star review."}
{"text":"Ordered my food for 12:55 they came at 12:05. Now, I got this sent to my work and decided on 12:55 because I would not be going on my break until 1. when I told them about this they didn't even try to compensate me in any way. \" next time you order, well get it right\" is all I got. or to send it back and get it at the right time. I use to work in a restaurant, so sending it back is not an option. Also, the food was terrible. The Chicken had bones in it, was covered in fat and over cooked. The aged tofu was not done right and had a weird jelly like substance on the out side of it. After I had a few bites of my chicken, which didn't even taste like chicken, I called to complain about my whole experience and they wouldn't do a thing. This is not acceptable. I also bought food for one of my coworkers as well (same order). All I asked was to be compensated for one of the meals and they wouldn't even do that. If I had another option for food I would have sent it back."}
{"text":"Cheap sushi deal around the area! Sashimi are fresh!!! What you pay for 2 combo at other places you could get 3 combos at this location!. 

Parking is only street parking and no AYCE. It is only a la carte."}
{"text":"We went here for a la carte menu and they don't have the basic rolls available. I wanted to order a sake (salmon) maki roll and they told me it wasn't available for me to have. Also the ayce table beside us got all their first page of orders before my simple yam and avocado maki arrived at our table. They were sat 10 min after us and ordered 5 minutes after us. After a very long while I finally got my food and it barely had rice on it and was messily put together. I'm very unhappy with this experience and I'm almost always very happy with my food experiences."}
{"text":"Found a cockroach in my seaweed salad. Laying dead on the side... ruined my appetite and everyone else at that table. Quality of food has seriously gone down in the last 4 years I've been here. I would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"After waiting for half an hour, server told us that the chef forgot to make half of our order! And this is all you can eat, so we had to wait for a long time.
The food quality is good though... try sashimi"}
{"text":"We've enjoyed the food from this place up until the last few months. On 3 occasions of ordering for home delivery we've received our food cold. Strike 3 \"you're out\". The food is alright as I've had much better but when you're finished work at the end of the day and you're tired, this place will do. Well we've moved on to a Japanese place on Queen East. Don't bother with this place, it ain't all that."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Sushi place in Toronto, a very clean and modern environment.  The lunch buffet is really fresh and tasty and the service is super quick.     For dinner you can order Sashimi which I didn't eat until I tried it here.      Awesome place and a very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I just have one downfall about this place. The waitressing staff. 
I go back continually, with the thought in mind that service is mediocre. Waiting staff could stand to smile.. and one thing I can't stress enough... when you're placing food down on your customers table, do not place it at the edge. Also, don't expect your paying customers to retrieve the dishes from the waitresses hands and place it on the table for them. That's why we tip you. To effectively carry out your job. Your tips are a reflection of your service you provide. it's your trade. You're not doing us a favor. remember that! It's also not just this restaurant that does this. It's a fair amount of servers in Sushi restaurants that are cold and grumpy. I guess it's a cultural thing. 
Now, to the sushi;
I love several items from their menu. Wakami salad and steamed egg are amongst the favorites that are not common in most AYCE sushi restaurants. I drive a fair distance to come to this restaurant. 
The Salmon sashimi has a bit of a chemical taste to it. I assume it's a chlorine or pesticide used to fight off some sort of Canadian food regulation for safety rule/limit.
Bathrooms are hideous. Far from clean. You sit way to close to other patrons. 
I went by one day to pick up take out, and I noticed it was closed. 
I peaked inside and it looked like major renovations were happening.
Here's hoping the staff will also be going through the refresher!
We all have an expectation and standard we want from AYCE. But for $20, you wont be breaking the bank for good sushi and rude servers. 
your choice!"}
{"text":"Formerly the best AYCE sushi place in the city, Aji Sai has unfortunately given up on quality and instead embraced a speedy, but ultimately unsatisfying approach to AYCE. Sure, they manage to offer more tables and the wait times have shortened, but your rice will be warm, Maki will be half-formed, and you're unlikely to get a good deal of what you order. 

Do yourself a favour and go elsewhere for your AYCE sushi fix."}
{"text":"Another AYCE sushi place. During our visit on Wednesday the a/c was not working very well. I found the chair a bit too low and the banquette is not padded...its just wood.

The place looks pleasant enough, but the service was desultory. I did not experience what others had (re bleach), but the tea cups were kinda sticky and greasy.

The Salmon sashimi was ok, as was the mackerel sashimi. Aside from that, nothing was memorable.

They charge for their soft drinks (unlike my favorite Maison du Japon), but they offer a few more desserts. Their ice cream is cheap and grainy.

The various forms of sushi we tried were ok.....but just that.

We will not return."}
{"text":"Sushi was pretty good, everything else was overly oily. They had a large variety of rolls, but they do taste very similar. The service was really good though!"}
{"text":"The food was okay. I am not having very much luck finding an all you can eat sushi restaurant in Toronto. I found the service EXTREMELY slow. 
We arrived at about 4 for dinner on a Saturday and it wasn't busy yet it took forever for the server to come over and take our order and we were completely ignored. In the 2 hrs that we were there, we only ordered two rounds of food. 
The food took a long time as well.

I was disappointed in the service. The food was alright. Not spectacular, but definitely not disappointing.
I would probably not come back here again because there are so many other options! :)"}
{"text":"What happened to this place?! This used to be my go to spot for sushi but it seems that the quality of the sushi has gone down a lot since the last time I've been here. Ordered the salmon sushi and I noticed right away that there was way too much rice. All the rolls I ordered, including the hand rolls had more rice than fish or other fillings. The seaweed salad was not the typical ones you see in restaurants, half was seaweed the other half was lettuce. The cheese wontons were the most disappointing, barely any cheese in them. They also used to sell a bbq salmon sushi which was amazing but unfortunately they downsized the menu and removed that item. The only items I enjoyed were the vegetable tempura and chicken Katsu, but then again it's hard to mess up deep fried items. All The changes to the menu did not justify the increase in price; not worth $20. Overall it was a very disappointing lunch"}
{"text":"When signs say things like \"All you can eat sushi for 10.99,\" it's really hard for me to say no.  So I didn't.

I should probably say that I've only been here for lunch; not sure if the menu is different, or if the price is different, for dinner.  Here's what I think about lunch.  Aji Sai offers up a big menu and most of it is available under the $11 umbrella.  This includes many kinds of maki and hand rolls, as well as things like gyoza, some barbecued meats, spring rolls, etc.  It doesn't include sashimi, but for $11, what else can you expect?

I enjoyed the food, and I'd probably give it a 7/10 on quality.  Not the best, but still excellent.  Service is a bit hit and miss there.  The thing seems to be the size of your group.  If you decide to go with your whole office (it happens...) be smart and divide yourself into groups of 4-6 people.  Anything bigger, and it just becomes too unwieldy.  The staff will (obviously) bring you your food but things get confusing easily, and it just turns into bad news for no one."}
{"text":"I can't be bothered to write a full review but between the waiter throwing a pencil at me, getting a platter full of the exact same rolls (although their clever names suggest otherwise) and finding not one but several hairs in our sushi, I will never return. I figure I've already waisted my money on this place, better not waste too much time on the review..."}
{"text":"Came here for my husband's bday as a second option. No reservation needed for a saturday lunch as they are not busy today. Service was great and the food was great. A lot of variety. I love their appetizer (coconut shrimp and mussels ). We asked for the dinner menu (cost us $27.95) instead of the lunch 17.95$ because my husband wanted the sashimi."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and mediocre food. Definitely not worth the money you pay. Won't be coming back l"}
{"text":"This is a favorite spot amongst our friend group- we love the all you can eat $20 dinner specials. There is a lot of assortment and the sashimi always tastes fresh. The decor is modern and clean (which is a nice change from some other Japanese restaurants in Toronto) and the staff is quick and efficient. Aji Sai gets really busy between 630-9pm so make a reservation ahead of time if you know you are going. 

Try the butterfish sashimi-so good! :)"}
{"text":"Wend there for All you can eat buffet.

Horrible customer service!  This is the first time in my life I did not leave a tip.  The waitress was rude. Never said thank you, please or you're welcome, no eye contact.  
Few times we called her over when she was passing by our table and she pretended not to here us. Took long time to clean our table. Forgot to bring us couple of dishes.  
We ate the desert while the pile of dirty dishes were still on our table. On top of that the last order, the desert (fried banana with ice cream) she brought for adults but forgot the kids.. Had to reorder and she brought them just ice cream. Ordered AGAIN and she told us we gonne have to wait 10 minutes.  

We asked to talk to a manager.  Took a while and she sent her friend who told as that she is the manager. We asked for her name. She said Jane.  And she just said sorry.  

I'm giving two stars only because the guys making sushi did a good job and all the food tasted good and fresh."}
{"text":"This place is typically bustling with customers on weekday afternoons. As far as the AYCE Sushi($11-14) is concerned -yes, generally conveyor belt sushi and AYCE are sub-par when compared to a slow sit down sushi bar. The menu features a lot of variety, yet everything tends to be drowned in rice. Still, you can get some decent Katsu and Grilled Salmon from their list of non-sushi items. Avoid the hand rolls like the plague, since the seaweed is impossible and tastes like plastic. 

My beef with the restaurant is the lack of staff during the obvious rush hours. It's a challenge to flag down a waiter for just about anything, and sometimes it will leave you extremely frustrated, so I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're at all pressed for time. 

It's definitely nowhere near great sushi in the GTA, but compared to restaurants in the area, like Wasabi, Aji Sai might be worth a visit."}
{"text":"Good: sushi on the all eat menu with lots of choice
Bad: slow service and a bit cold inside (in winter)"}
{"text":"Basic sushi spot, I find the prices not to bad at all. I did get the feeling that they serve you quickly and you get the mentality that they want you to eat quick and leave so the next people can come in. Compared to all the sushi spots in Toronto this one isn't stand out or anything."}
{"text":"I think I have reviewed enough amazing places to open door number \"bad review\". I'm not THAT picky, I eat absolutely everything and I do have the occasional taste bud so I won't exactly eat garbage. I went to Aji Sai over 10 times. At first it was great. The sushi was great, I think Hockey and 168 are better but I haven't tried them before my Aji Sai experience so this was fine. I took all my friends here, my family.

I HAVE BOYCOTTED AJI SAI. Forever. Too bad for them because I am a generous and hungry (maybe not so good for an AYCE place?...) customer.

The food was fine but the service....oh god, the service! I felt like garbage, they treat you like poo and actually yell at you. I am a nice person HOW DARE YOU YELL AT ME! I didn't do anything wrong. The last 3 times I went, it took over 20 minutes for them to bring out the first item. A wakame salad, seriously. Sour faces for all, there was not a smile in sight. A guy sat down, also, at the same time as me and my two friends and was full of sushi/ready to pay when we got our first rolls. I'm not exaggerating - it was awful.

For the positive, the love roll is good...that's it. You get one extra star for that.

All the times I left this place I felt down and upset and trust me - there is something wrong with a place that can upset me.

(PS My review would be completely different for the downtown location...i love it there.)"}
{"text":"Honestly, I came in here expecting absolute garbage because of the one downtown. However, I was wrong.  VERY wrong. This place recently reopened, either late 2015 or early 2016, and I'll just say that it's good. This place pays attention to small details, and I really appreciate that. In other AYCE sushi joints, the rice is usually not prepared great and everything kinda falls apart. But the eel sushi here was fantastic, the little piece of seaweed holding it together was actually CRISPY. This is unheard of at an AYCE place. 

Verdict: it's good. There are a lot of options as you'd expect from an AYCE place. It's clean and food comes relatively quickly. 

That's all."}
{"text":"We ordered from them on Foodora. Food was an hour late (confirmed to be the restaurant's fault). Chicken and dumplings were cold. Salad was soggy. Would never order from here again."}
{"text":"Meh. Just ok. Canned tuna on the excellent roll? weird. No tuna sashimi...humph, that sucks. 
Rolls were warm. sashimi was warm. Gyoza heavily deep fried - yucky. Rolls had little rice which was good but sushi pieces were the thinest slices
I have ever seen! You could read a magazine through them because they were so thin!
No low salt soy sauce (don't be fooled by the green tops -- it's all the same regular soy sauce).
Service was good, hence the 2 stars. 
No plans on ever returning."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for dinner the other day. AYCE sushi. The menu is very tame, nothing exotic. Fried oyster sushi is not exotic. They didn't have octopus (I am referring to sashimi). Maybe there is an etiquette reason for not having it in the menu. At any rate, the food was good, but nothing spectacular.

We had a lively conversation and stayed for a long time and at no point where we made to feel that we had over-extended our welcome."}
{"text":"This is my go-to for all you can eat sushi in Toronto. A great balance of price, quality and location. The menu is okay, ingredients fresh, and service is swift.

One itsy gripe is that in the winter, you know, that stretch of six months when everything gets cold and dark, the doors have a tendency to be left open by parties entering and exiting. When that happens a blast of frigid air will make you feel definitely not warm. One of those fancy, heavy winter curtains would solve that problem, or just better doors, but if you don't see those accessories between the months of November and April, grab a seat as far away from there as possible."}
{"text":"I've been to Aji Sai many times and it has become my favourite All You Can Eat Sushi joint in Toronto. Because of the popularity of this place, you may have to wait in line, but once you get in the service is usually quick. The firehouse roll and the cheese wontons here are to die for. I feel those two dishes alone are worth the trip to Aji Sai."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour. PLEASE DO NOT EAT HERE. They have the worst customer service ever! It took us forever to receive all of our orders and they did not give us some of our orders. we ordered salmon belly, we waited for like 15-20 mins and when we asked the server, she checked the kitchen and told us they ran out of the salmon belly. All of the customers were like waiting for their orders to come. Will not comeback here. Terrible restaurant and customer service."}
{"text":"This place is my go-to for good cheap AYCE sushi.

The location is great since you'll be hungry after a super long tiring day of shopping around downtown and seeing this bad boy down the street is awesome.

Dinner is a little bit pricey but this place is great at lunch so if you're planning to make a trip to eat here, try to aim going during lunch hours.

Food quality and taste here varies. On some days it'll be tasty and fresh while on other days, it'll be lacking in taste and the quality is sub-par. The service is some what lacking but that's alright, at least they talk to you, unlike Kyoto House down on Dundas, where they grunt and make weird cavemen sounds at you. My favourite sushi roll would be the sakura roll, oh man it was delicious. Spicy Salmon Sushi is also one of my favourites as well!

Overall, definitely check this place out if you haven't already but you'll be in for a real treat if you go on a good day!"}
{"text":"Price: 4.5 stars
Food: 4 stars
Service: 4.5 stars
Environment: 3.5
*Don't leave left overs, you have to pay $5 for that.*"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favourite place for AYCE sushi place. Although some of the staffs are not so friendly but the food are definitely satisfying. When I've friends visiting me in Toronto, I always bring them here and they were always satisfied with the food, both the variety and quality."}
{"text":"I came here for all-you-can-eat sushi lunch on Friday. Man, the place was packed! We still managed to get a seat in 10 minutes (I've waited far longer at popular Chinese restaurants lol), and when we placed our orders the food came surprisingly fast. I'm impressed by how well they handled the peak workload.

One thing that concerned me is that the waitresses came around quite frequently to refill your glass of water. After the first few times, I started looking at the clock each time they came by our table, and they came about every 10 minutes (or ~6 times per hour). It's not wrong or anything, but I think it might be a subtle strategy to encourage drinking more water to fill the stomach and avoid eating so much AYCE food.

As far as the food goes, the sushi tasted well-flavoured and fresh. It met my expectations compared to what I've had at other sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"This is more 2.5 star-ish. I think it's better to come here for the AYCE. I popped in for a quick post-work out dinner here and just wanted a couple rolls.

The regular menu is kind of limited, didn't feel like there were any good sushi/sashimi combo dinners.

I settled on 2 rolls - a california roll and something called a Queen roll which was supposed to have mango in it. When it arrived, it didn't have a mango in it. Meh.

Also, considering I ordered $14 of rolls, it would have been good service for them just to bring me the small complimentary miso soup and salad that comes with every other dinner combo - but they didn't.

The rolls were pretty tasty, however, and rolled large but with not too much rice - just right. 

Service was mediocre."}
{"text":"Good variety of food, little attention to detail (Plastic was in my friend's hand roll!) and terrible customer service. We won't be returning for that reason alone!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today.  Salmon sushi.  It was wonderful!  Food is a definite 5 star.  Service was really slow though, and a bit confused by our large party and the different orders."}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times before they had a fire and renovated. The sushi is not bad but the hot items need to be worked on. I notice they charge more now since the renovation but one thing that will always be the same is the staff are not friendly and don't smile"}
{"text":"First time here, not bad, but not that great. A few things my husband and friends shared were spicy salmon crispy, California roll (not great) cheese wonton (mostly batter) I did really like the veal chop (Kalbi) that was hot and flavourful. The salmon and butterfish sashimi was good and fresh. Service was ok, good at clearing the table, but did not offer to refill tea, water, soft drinks at all. I don't think I will come here again. I much prefer sushi queen!"}
{"text":"They don't bring half the stuff you order for the all you can eat. I think they do it on purpose because others have pointed out the same thing. 
Sushi taste was also well below average. Even the soya sauce and hot sauce tasted odd."}
{"text":"This is a really good sushi buffet place that is downtown on Queen & Spadina. If you are ever downtown & wants some good sushi. Check it out but go during the weekday on Mon to Thursday when they are less busy. Mon/Tuesday is better. 

Don't go on Fridays & weekend as it's too busy and the service will be bad.

The only thing is I felt the rushed us way too much like they keep on asking on if we want to order anything else as they want to get the table from seat other people.

The food quality was good and fresh. I liked the sashimi, grlled squid, seaweed salad and all the rolls. They didn't put alot of rice on the roll to make you full like a lot of sushi buffet places which is great and the portions are really generous."}
{"text":"Can't say the fish was of the highest quality. The general chicken was undercooked and gummy. The nori for the hand rolls was crazy chewy and the service was a C- at best. Very curt and short. The selection on the menu wasn't great either, the dinner and lunch menus could be different though. All in all 2/5 can't really recommend."}
{"text":"Pretty average AYCE.  We were in the mood for AYCE sushi (and 8Sushi was not opened yet!) and went over here on the Danforth.  They have other locations too.

Nothing to write home about, pretty average sushi and offering.  Average price too.  You get what you pay for.  Haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Another AYCE japanese place run by Chinese. 
Food is horrible, sushi tastes like garbage, fish is not fresh at all.
Consider yourself lucky if you do not get a diarrhea after visiting this place."}
{"text":"Aji Sai was a very average joint.  I ate here kind of on a whim while doing a walking tour of the Danforth.  They have a good selection of sushi and other Japanese items.

The quality was pretty firmly average.  Some of my sushi tasted on the fishy side and was a little wattery, so I think they may skimp a bit on the quality of their ingredients.   The prices are reasonable although not outstanding.  They were very quick and the service was good, but for the price, I think there are other sushi places I might try instead.  My friend had a dish with tempura which was generally well-done and earned them a little bit back compared to their sushi quality.  

Overall, a pretty neutral experience.  Nothing good, nothing bad.  It looks like they do a lot of take-out and delivery business, as I saw lots of food walking out the front door."}
{"text":"4th time going here.
It was really crowded yesterday but the waiting time for a table was short. Service was really fast as usual. There were no order mix-ups. Going for lunch is the best minus the fact that you don't get any sashimi.

If you're going to get sushi, I highly recommend the Dynamite Roll, Green and Black Dragon Roll. Their Chicken Teriyaki and Squid Tempura was also very delicious. Otherwise, the food was up to par, better than most AYCE places."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time when I was in the area but it's definitely gone downhill since a year ago. 

Sashimi was a bit chewy. Could've been the size of the pieces. They are big but maybe by cutting down the sizes could help the chewiness. 

We ordered a bunch of dishes from the kitchen. Everything was honestly average. There was nothing mind blowing. At all.  

Which sucks cause they were my go to AYCE sushi joint. 

The service was also 'meh' at best. It wasn't too busy but we felt neglected. 

Just my 2 cents."}
{"text":"Modern AYCE sushi restaurant located on Bathurst and Queen that provides an extensive list of food choices for a relatively cheap price (given its location). Interior is clean tastefully decorated.

Pretty standard list of sashimi choices, although I would have liked to see squid or octopus. Sashimi tasted fresh. Surprisingly, rolls and makis arrived before sashimi orders. Recommend the Volcano Roll and Aji Sai Sushi. Veal chops and salmon belly were also very good. Standard dessert choices such as ice cream, jelly, egg pudding, and fried banana. 

Service is quick and servings are exactly as ordered; they don't skimp on giving you your sashimi. Seating is comfortable and not cramped. Ambiance is quiet and subdued. 

4 stars, would return again if in the area."}
{"text":"I live close to here and ever since I was little, I remembered going here for occasions or just for dinner. Honestly I think it's a great place! Unfortunately, however. Myself with my boyfriend and my mother went there for dinner, expecting great food. Their steak teriyaki was microwaved, their sashimi was very disappointing. Not only were they small slices, they were cut badly. I'm really disappointed after coming here, hopefully they get better soon!"}
{"text":"Downtown all you can eat sushi never fails to disappoint me.

Sashimi was barely passable, but that's not super surprising. 

The rolls were pretty bad. Lacking in any real taste and seemed dry for some reason. We ordered a roll with cream cheese that came out really strange, to the point of being inedible.

The best things were:
-Ikayaki (squid in a honey barbeque sauce)
-Scallop hand roll

Service was pretty terrible. Again, I have low expectations for AYCE, but why does it take 3 order attempts, and over 40 minutes to finally get ice cream? Is it that hard to open a fridge door?

Malus (opposite of bonus): Why do they insist on playing the most annoying pop songs of the last 25 years on loop (if you're there for more than 70 minutes you'll hear the same songs again!!!). This was the CD mix from HELL."}
{"text":"My friends and I wanted to find an AYCE place that wasn't too far in the boonies since we lived all over the place.  So we decided to head to Aji Sai in Thornhill - conveniently located in the middle of all 6 of us.

It was a typical AYCE restaurant - owend by Chinese people and what not.  We were seated in a room.  Considering that it was 5 guys.. and me, we ordered quite a lot.  Surprisingly, our order came by REALLY quickly - and very little things were missing from our orders!  I was surprised about that. 

However, I wish they had descriptions of what each sushi roll was -- my friends and I decided to order the most ridiculous sounding ones and just went from there.  Sushi was okay - wasn't *amazing* -- typical sushi in uptown Toronto.

The only problem was that when we were waiting for our bill - they took FOREVER to come by."}
{"text":"A hidden gem with all the Japanese basics well-executed and well-priced. It's my first choice for sushi on the Danforth."}
{"text":"A pretty decent restaurant but it has a limited menu for all you can eat. The sushi is average quality as expected at most AYCE places but service is good. 

This place is good for a casual meal but if you want better quality for a fancy event I would suggest another place."}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean and nice, maybe a bit dim, but nothing major.  The food was decent, the seaweed salad wasn't what I expected or was used to, again, nothing major.  The service was average, nothing over the top but nothing outrageous either.  Until the bill came.

As a table, we had enough on us for a tip in cash, but not enough to pay the bill full in cash.  So we decided to pay the bill on cards and leave cash for tip.  Except, when the waitress was processing the last payment, she snarkily remarked: \"just so you know, tip is not included in the price\".  Great, thanks.  We were going to tip you in cash, but you just saved all of us some money."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced AYCE sushi for lunch... the last time I went, I believe it was $11.99. Great location as well; I love Queen Street; and this is not too far from the Urban Outfitters on Queen.

Deets? 

Ambience: I am a fan of the upscale, clean decor. Nice seating too. It's a small restaurant but doesn't appear to be so.

Crowd: Group of friends, business lunches, Asian people... haven't seen very many family lunches here...

Variety: Not a huge AYCE menu, but you get salmon sushi so what the heck?

Verdict? I keep going back... and I will continue to"}
{"text":"Friday evening, me and my friend decided  to have some \"good sushi\".
The place was filled with people having \"all you can eat\", they were served fast and promptly.
Me and my friend had to wait  @15 min, just to order our food.
The waitress was somehow helpful, but gave me impression she was too busy to wait for our order. When the food came, it was just average. Sushi A (rice) was falling apart, edamame was a nice little snack to munch on, dragon sushi seemed to be better. Dessert-tiramisu-good enough, but the size of it was just like a little sample ( 2 bites).Mango ice-cream?
well, made from the concentrate and a bit too sweet.
Overall just average place. Looked like the waitresses wanted us to go asap- she wanted us to pay, without even ordering the dessert. l know they have better business serving \"all you can eat\"- but pls do not rush me to go if l am not willing to.
Because of that  attitude and just average wuality of the food,  it is rather unlikely for me to go there again."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now... Lovin' the cheese wontons"}
{"text":"Rude waitresses. I'm appalled at how many times we (a group of 4) were approached by different waitresses about last call orders or what we want for dessert to get us to leave. 

We waited ~20 minutes for our second order to arrive and when we asked about it, we were told \"the kitchen is really busy right now\", which is fine, no problem. The manager came over to ask how we were doing and I mentioned that we were waiting for our food. Before she could respond, a waitress came over and said \"your order is coming!\" to get the manager to leave. 

They also brought us two bills at separate times. Once before our dessert order arrived and again when we were eating dessert, likely due to the lack of communication between staff members. 

Sushi was made poorly and sizing was inconsistent. Food tasted okay - not great and it definitely doesn't make me want to go back, especially given the service. 

One waitress was really nice though. Constantly refilled our drinks and took our orders. 

I've eaten here one other time and had the opposite experience. This was when they still had men on their wait staff though."}
{"text":"The food quality is better than your average ayce and the wait staff were some of the nicest servers. I wish 100% of my bill went to their tip.
The amount of time I waited for the sushi bar was atrocious. By the time the first 5,6 pieces of nigiri came my friend finished all the kitchen food he ordered.
I ended up paying 24.95 plus tax and tip for 5,6 pieces of nigiri, 2 miso soup, 2 salad and a cup of tea. With that, it's actually better value to go just across the street to ToNe.
According to Google, this location is closing soon. I hope there will be a new ayce place with a different layout where a part of the patron area is used to extend the sushi bar for more chefs."}
{"text":"Pretty good as far as AYCE goes. Following their reno and reopening, it looks like food quality has increased. Sashimi cuts are somewhat thin but the fish is superior quality compared to the average AYCE place. We'll see if this keeps up after their business picks up. The menu has also expanded to include an extensive variety of cooked foods, desserts, and even drinks! To go with, I think the price may also have increased slightly.

I haven't been here for lunch yet, but it will be interesting to see how much rice they stuff their rolls with compared to the filling."}
{"text":"Food here was NOT impressive at all. I feel like over the years aji sai's food here has gone downhill. I ordered a red dragon roll, which was executed sloppily with thin butchered pieces of salmon thrown on top and the dynamite roll had too much sauce on top which overwhelmed the actual taste of the roll. All the kitchen dishes took 45 min to arrive, which we asked 3 different waiters for before it showed up to our table. The forced 10% gratuity is not appreciated either considering our experience and service here. Paying 28$ for mediocre saucy sushi and negligent service almost seems like a scam! 

Not eating here anytime soon, or ever."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night as my partner had a sushi craving and wanted to try a different AYCE place than our usual, Echo.

Menu is very comprehensive and it is nice to be able to order red tuna and butterfish on an AYCE menu.  Lots of fancy maki, too.  Quality was very good, but I think Echo's sushi is a tad fresher.  Kitchen items varied - gyoza were delicious, chicken teriyaki too fatty and tough, and fried tofu was fried at too low a temperature.  Miso could have been a bit better too.  Very good mango ice cream - not sure whose they use.

Atmosphere is fairly minimal and not memorable.  Service was very helpful and considerate."}
{"text":"Menu is identical to the downtown place.  Fish was very fresh - much better than our last visit downtown which was disappointing.  Atmosphere is a bit more suburban and this location has private booths."}
{"text":"In the world of sushi AYCE this place scores as \"decent\".

There are a few dishes that are tasty and different, and others that are very \"meh\". Service also was inconsistent and sketchy, but not horrible. I am actually struggling to write much as there really isn't anything negative or positive. The only negative I can think of is that for the price there are better AYCE sushi out there, but there may be some that really enjoy this place.

If your in the area, it's worth a try, but otherwise I wouldn't go out of my way to visit."}
{"text":"After moving to Toronto, this was the first meal out for my wife and I based on the previous Yelp reviews, and it was amazing.

We had the all you can eat buffet, which we typically avoid, but we certainly got our money's worth this time. Any kind of sushi imaginable is served, and it all tastes amazing. It was very packed, yet once we were seated the food was served very promptly.

So the food itself is great, but there are a number of cons that make the experience a bit unpleasant.

There is a good selection aside from the sushi, but it is a little more limited than other Japanese buffets I've been to. For example, no dumplings! I also got the vibe that they really don't want you to dine-in unless you are paying for all you can eat. They also never asked us if we wanted any more after our first order, we had to flag them down to indicate that yes, we really would like all that we can eat, as advertised.

It is typically packed to the brim, so you're going to have to wait. I also believe that all-you-can-eat buffets are scams in general, and you can most certainly get just as stuffed at another restaurant for less money, depending what you order.

The food was great, but there are a few Japanese restaurants in the area that taste great too and offer more value (e.g. Ho Su Bistro to the east), so I can't say there's enough here to make me choose this place over the others."}
{"text":"Their $12.99 AYCE lunch special is a favourite at Queen and Spadina. There was a line-up but my friend and I didn't wait longer than 10 minutes, and by the time we sat down, we knew what to order thanks to being given the menu while we waited. 

The atmosphere is fast-paced; it does make for an interesting scene when you see servers bicker about getting the orders on time to your table. It's also a little frustrating when you're trying to get their attention to order more food. They're so focused on fast service that they end up rushing in their actions, which can result into mistakes. 

One example was our server banged the leg of the chair into my foot as I was leaving it and they wanted to clear the table right away. It didn't hurt and he did apologize but witnessing their speedy service, I was tempted to turn to them and tell them to, \"R-E-L-A-X.\" I might be leniant but someone else might not be. 

As for the food, the lunch menu is long so you have a lot of choices of sushi rolls, maki and tempura to try. My friend and I had the squid tempura (very chewy), large sushi rolls of tempura shrimp, fresh salmon and eel (one of these was called Rock 'N Roll). One roll we did try was the Cowboy Roll, which was stuffed with onions and beef. Personally, I didn't think it paired well with the other fish dishes and tasted more like a cheap steak wrapped in rice.  

A challenge with all you can eat sushi is that you end up ordering too much and in some restaurants, you get charged for leftovers. Here, the platters are small, about four to six pieces, so there's minimal leftovers. However we didn't have this problem. We left the restaurant comforting our swollen bellies and with satiate look on our faces. 

Aji Sai is worth a revisit but perhaps not during the lunch or dinner rush. 

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"This a cheap lunchtime AYCE, and I came here often when I worked nearby with my colleagues. They have a fairly large selection on the menu, even for lunch, at a decent price ($12.99/lunch), though the food itself is just average--not bad, not great. 
The service here, however, could use improvement. The majority of the time, the waitstaff is essentially hurrying us to leave so they can turn over the table. The most recent visit was entirely opposite: we couldn't even wave down a waiter to refill our waters, much less take our orders. If you can overlook the service, it's a decent price for decent AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"A few years ago, I used to frequent this place pretty often.  Recently I have found that the quality isn't as good anymore.  The last time we went, we couldn't stop drinking water during and after our meal.  This was a clear indicator, that we were consuming a lot of MSG.  

Lots of choices for rolls, but it's a pretty standard AYCE.  Service is quick, but sometimes food items are overlooked.  My favourite is the firehouse roll, which is shrimp tempura and banana on the inside, topped with tuna on the outside.  

If you're going as a big group, consider making a reservation."}
{"text":"We came to this sushi place for dinner. The sushi was below average. The waitress initially provided a paper for us to fill out (we opted for the all you can eat) the order that we received was not correct it was missing many items. We had to inform the waitress to bring each item that was missing."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here a couple days ago and she was hospitalized for the last two days! Please be careful if you eat here it's not the highest in quality clearly. The health board has also been notified since this was the only place she had eaten that day and by how severe the food poisoning was. If I could give zero stars I would plus I never plan on eating here again. She thinks it was the butterfish sashimi."}
{"text":"Such a find for lunch. Typically all you-can-eat places are a bit sketchy
but I love the $10 lunch. Ouch! that little bottle of sake will set u back $20 bucks - my cheap lunch went out the window with that decision but it was a sweet experience and thoroughly enjoyable. I love the little disclaimer on the lunch menu that warns if you over order and can't eat it you will be charged at the per item rate. That's a first..but smart wouldn't you agree?"}
{"text":"Not sure how I haven't reviewed this place, as this has been my #1 sushi joint in Toronto for years now.

Simply put, service is swift and friendly, the sushi is delicious and fresh TO DEATH (not literally for humans, but I guess so for the fish), and the price is right for AYCE. I don't think I've ever had to wait more than 15 minutes for my order, no matter how large the order, nor how busy the place.

I love y'all! Don't ever leave me."}
{"text":"Aji Sai? More like Aji SIGH... Because that's what I spent the better part of my 90-minute visit doing here.

Coming in on empty stomachs, bae and I were excited for AYCE sushi. We quickly filled out our first order, checking off 10+ separate items, and handing it to a server. Thus began the waiting and the sighs.

20 minutes later, we got our first plate, a small order of sashimi. Shortly thereafter, gyoza. Eventually, green dragon maki rolls. 

Soon enough, a server came by with a tray of four plates.... FINALLY! But kidding, he was at the wrong table. He snatched the plates back up, mumbled something, and walked away. (This happened a second time later during our \"meal.\") We were sad. In our boredom, we filled out our second order and gave it to a server, letting him know that we still hadn't gotten the majority of our first order 40 minutes after ordering. He just said \"Oh okay, sorry,\" and never followed up about it.

Looking around at the FOUR other seated tables in the entire restaurant, we were perplexed as to why service was so painfully slow and inattentive. Our patience was running thin. 1.5 hours in, we started to get small plates of sushi from our second order, when we still hadn't received most of the sushi from our first. Aji SIGHHHHH.

Your girl was cheesed. Bae and I got our things and walked up to the front. I told the guy standing there that this was the worst service I've ever received, and that I was refusing to pay for this monstrosity of a dining experience (lol). Turns out he was the manager, and instead of trying to make the situation better, he demanded that we pay for everything we ate. The servers ran up and started defending themselves in their native language (Japanese I assume), so we couldn't corroborate their statements. But basically I gathered that they were saying \"They ate! I brought them food!\" Yeah, we ate five dinky little plates of food over 90 minutes... Thanks for that.

In the end, we got hustled and gave in to the manager's demand for $20 because we're spineless :'("}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now for the All You Can Eat sushi lunch, both times on weekends.  Although it is always busy, I have never waited more than 5 or 10 minutes for a table.  

Food is decent quality and a great selection.  You order off a menu but you can order as much as you want.  Don't order too much or you will be charged for wasted food!

I find the staff very attentive, and I don't think they rush people at all.  I think that some of the previous reviewers have mistaken the staff's efficiency for poor service.  Yes, they sometimes bring the bill before they've even brought dessert, but who cares - they do it so that when you are ready to leave, you can do so.

My friends and I always leave here happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"After a four day week, which felt like an eternity, a few colleagues and I decided to go out for dinner. Between the six of us, the majority felt like Japanese rather than Greek cuisine. 

This place is more convenient for me (during the weekday) than anything else. It's about a 20 minute walk and 5 minute drive from my workplace.

As we did not have a reservation, we were required to wait for about five minutes. The five minutes were to put the tables together. Half of us ordered from the sushi menu and the other half ordered dinner sets - chicken teriyaki and salmon teriyaki. The service was quite slow and it took a good 15 minutes to receive forks that we requested. Portion sizes for the dinner sets were quite big. For example, the salmon teriyaki set comes with two pieces of salmon. The sushi was okay; it didn't blow me away.

For the drivers of Toronto, it's quite inconvenient as there is only metered parking. I must say, this area has the most feisty parking enforcements ever! I went with my colleague in his car. After bidding our farewells to everyone and wishing each other a happy Easter, we noticed that expensive yellow piece of paper on his windshield. We were two minutes late and there was already a $30 ticket.

For the TTC users, it is about a five minute walk from Donlands Station on the Bloor-Danforth line."}
{"text":"I believe this establishment is in need of money. They are grabbing money from their patrons in any form possible. They threaten to charge me for 3 unfinished sushi because of their 'new policy'. (Note we only ordered one round of food) 
To add to the insult, I received a deadly stare that lasted 5 seconds that made sure I paid tips for their 'service'.  
Food wise, sashimi could have been fresher.
Service wise, miles of improvement needed.

Will I return? Maybe never."}
{"text":"Ok i am not going to lie but let's be honest. I can't believe that this place gets 3.5 stars. I know most people who live in downtown love to go there because it's more convenient for them . And they don't even know how bad the place really is.  Yes, i know that this place is better than most of sushi places downtown .However if you compare to all the place around GTA, this place is a joke. The food is just decent, and some stuffs are just bad. Last time i ordered sushi, the sushi was like so big. Like twice of the size it should be. Even a salmon sushi was so small but the rice is so large. The quality is like just below decent. The service is beyond the worst of all the restaurant I experienced. I am not talking about that i was being avoid, but it seems like they just want to start a fight with you. The service was pretty slow most of times. And it's funny how bad it is that it is always packed. If you want to go to the best all you can eat sushi places then just travel uptown. Trust me after you try out many other ones you probably won't come back to this place."}
{"text":"After hearing raving reviews from friends, a friend and I decided to grab a late sushi dinner at Aji Sai.

We got there around 9 pm and I was surprised that there were at least 10 other people dining that late. 

Service was \"meh\"..nothing memorable to comment on. However, I don't see what the rush was because one of the guys just walked by really fast and slid our glasses of water on the table which made the water spill onto the table.

My friend ordered a bento box and I ordered the salmon sashimi, firehouse, and spider maki. If I knew there was AYCE, I would've arrived on an empty stomach. The maki rolls were awesome and nothing fell apart (y). If you ever go to Aji Sai, try out their Firehouse maki. It sounds gross because there's banana in it but my friend insisted that I order it.

I would totally give them full stars but the service brought them down."}

{"text":"I've been here a few times but the time that that stands out was Valentine's day last year. My fiance and I really wanted to go to a nice ayce sushi restaurant and we had heard amazing things. And they were right, fresh, fast, delicious. Portions where huge and everything was made so quickly and most of it tastes amazing. But I need to talk about why I only gave 4 stars. I would have given 3 but the food was honestly really, really good, especially for an ayce! My issue is that my fiance is a vegetarian and we would get his sushi served with mine. Now I don't care, but he didn't want his food touching my fish, which I can understand. And I'm talking dragon rolls, salmon roses and unagi was on a shared plate with his yam tempura Maki rolls and egg sushi. They were a bit hesitant on making his again and making them seperate even though we had stated when we first ordered drinks and when we ordered our first round that it was to be seperate. Also I'm severely allergic to mackerel which I also told the serve to which the chef has made something with mackerel before my food (I'm totally guessing here) and I had started to get sick. Some fresh air and lots of water helped and I didn't need a pill but I was pissed this happened in the first place. Other times I've gone they have been great and attentive and I tell them many times (the poor servers probably think I'm a huge bitch) while ordering about the vegetarianism and my allergies and I haven't had a problem since, but that first experience sucked so much"}

they dont deserve support"}
{"text":"Aji Sai is my favourite place to go for sushi :] maybe I just haven't discovered the best knock-out sushi place yet, but I think Aji Sai comes close!
Admittedly I only go for their lunch special--11 for all you can eat is really such a deal that I would just go there every day if I could. Too bad my stomach has a limit to how much sushi it can eat.
On top of the great price, the sushi is also pretty good. It's not gourmet, but I don't think anyone expects that from an all you can eat place. I always get eel handrolls though--I love eel and it's all you can eat!
My only complaint is that it's usually crowded around lunchtime, but I guess that's not strange. For such a good deal, I'm surprised they haven't hired security yet to calm down the crowds! Looks like my secret sushi hideout has been discovered by the masses."}
{"text":"If extreme sushi eating were an olympic sport, I'd...well I'll be honest. I  probably wouldn't win. But at least I'd make it to the little leagues.

This aji sai would be my training grounds. Get ready, competitors!

Clean, spacious, almost quadruple the size of the one downtown on queen street west, the waits are not nearly as deadly. They even have individual rooms off to the sides for large parties (over 4?).

With a variety of rolls with dubious names, aji sai is pleasant enough. Warning: they take their time with your orders and they always seems to forget part of it. Not a good thing on your first order, but a good thing for the subsequent few rounds to give you time to refresh and recuperate. Work those digestive muscles!

Some roll favourites include red/green/black dragon (rolls with topped with salmon/avocado/eel respectively), dynamite, rock n roll, spider, and spicy anything. There is one with banana and cream cheese (fire house? crazy love roll?). either way, avoid."}
{"text":"Owner is arrogant and rude. Came here a long time ago food was ok.

A while ago I went with my 1.5 yo to there and he charged $3 for that. Saying rice cost money in a very rude way. The waiter looked embrassed when the owner said that. Not that it was wrong but I have been to other all you can eat sushi place with her and 1.5 yo was never charged for anything. My lo was hungry at that time and there aint many choices at that plaza so we settled.

If you come right when they start their business you will know it is very clean. Because all you can smell is chemical. 

The price (even without a baby/toddler) is not that cheap compare to the food they serve."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, good price for Japanese food, decent sushi, BUT the service needs improvement. It was hard to get a hold of someone when we needed things like food and drink. The biggest star-drain for this place was that we didn't get everything we ordered. We even asked for those items several times, and were reassured that they were coming right out, but they never did. We eventually gave up and ordered dessert. The dessert sure did come out. I think our table got cut off :(. We didn't even order that much vs. how many people we had. Perhaps it is better if you come here in smaller groups."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place no stars. We came to this sushi place again even tho they have horrible service because my boyfriend wanted their sesame chicken. Well, we didn't even get our sesame chicken and the staff is still incompetent and still don't care about their guests. There were 2 waiters and none of them ever came To our table. I'm honestly fed up with this place. Never again visiting."}
{"text":"This place makes Miso happy! They are Soy awesome!

For $23.99 all you can eat dinner, you really get your money's worth at Aji Sai! I came here with a friend a couple nights ago after we were craving ayce sushi downtown and somewhere closer to the Entertainment District/Old Toronto 
Surprisingly, this was one of the few places that we could find... So it's not a surprise, when our expectations were high and the food blew me over!
Both Kitchen (Miso soup, salmon belly, tempuras, salad, teriyakis, pad thai etc) and sushi menu are fairly stocked and have a large variety of items to chow down on! 

The Thornhill location tends to have more variety of food items (more sashimi varieties, more special rolls) but the current items are more than enough to fill you up. Those more daring may find the menu a little lacking for tempting their taste buds but for us, the menu was just perfect. 
We ended up ordering (the usual) colour rolls (black dragon, red, green) in addition to Philadelphia (Friend's choice, I can't stand cheese in sushi...), Spider roll (Absolute favourite!) and items from the kitchen (tempura, grilled items, and teriyakis)
And topped it off with dessert (Egg pudding was delicious!) + Ice Cream (Vanilla/Mango/Green Tea/Red Bean) and they were delivered fairly quickly!
Servers were a little rude, and they seemed rushed, but this could have also been due to the high volume of customers on that particular day. We were the last ones to leave the restaurant, and they were extremely nice and accommodating and didn't seem like they were rushing us to leave. 

All in all, food - 4/5 (Take off a star for lack of variety)
Service - 4/5
Money's worth - 4/5 
Convenience - 5/5 (there's not a lot of good ayce sushi places near this area...)"}
{"text":"It seems like they expanded since I've walked past this place. The new room was freezing cold. They had a portable heater behind our table that didn't really do much so the dining experience was kinda of out the door. In terms of food, they have a decent selection of sushi at lunch at a cheap price, but that was not worth it for me when I got food poisoning after eating at this place. It's safe to say that I will not be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Been there a bunch of times with coworkers.  Every time I went I got all you can eat sushi. 

Locale: if you are there with two people the tables are pretty small, with more people the the tables are comfortable.  Some of the tables close to the door can get cold, but otherwise fine.

Food: The food is good, not amazing, but for $18 (including tax and tip) it is worth the visit.

Service: The service is good, did need to call them to order more food a couple of times, but no major issues"}
{"text":"At work we did a lot of our farewell lunches here at Aji Sai. The quality for the price is quick good, and I usually walked away feeling satisfied.

They don't handle large groups too well sometimes. One time we were under the impression they were cutting us off and we had hardly had any food. We ordered a lot of food, but we had 13 mouths to feed...

When it comes to all you can eat sushi this is my place in Toronto. I would recommend going for lunch though as it is cheaper then. :)  Try the pan fried squid!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was pretty good for an AYCE joint. We got there at 6.15 and it was still relatively quiet. But it filled up in about 15 minutes!

We were really happy with the sushi and sashimi but not so impressed with the rest of the menu items. 

Service was about as expected for a busy Saturday night yet they still managed to bring everything we ordered. This will probably become our regular AYCE sushi haunt from now on!"}
{"text":"AYCE Sushi Weekday Lunch for 1:

I found the price okay for the area, but the quality of the sushi was not that great. Service was good for an AYCE sushi place.

The avocado was very squishy and resembled a thick sauce. That certainly made the green dragon roll very interesting... mushy avocado and filled with too many cucumbers. It definitely was a 'green' dragon roll. All their rolls are small which I guess is great if you want to try many different kinds. I did like the crazy love roll... a mix of salmon, cream cheese and tuna which I hadn't seen before. The oyster roll was deepfried, but I'm not sure what I was expecting. Presentation was uninspired and an afterthought... did they really just serve me a make with one of the rolls leaning over?

The salmon sushi was expectedly thin. The tamago sushi was falling apart. Of the kitchen orders, the katsu was thick and had meat content, which I thought was far better than most sushi places. The kalbi beef (veal chop it's called on the menu) didn't have enough sauce, and wasn't as tender as it could be.

The (men's) washroom is clean, but has lots of graffiti.

Next time I'll resist the urge for AYCE sushi and eat at one of many other great non-sushi places in the area."}
{"text":"Finally, I found an all you can eat Sushi place downtown, and on Queen West none the less! And lucky for me (and all Toronto sushi lovers), it's affordable and great quality and service.

The restuarant is mid-sized, and can be found 1 block West of Spadina on Queen. Not sure if the place takes reservations, as we walked in on a Wednesday night, but I would recommend you call ahead if so as it seems like it would fill up quick. On this particular typical bitter winter weeknight, the place was packed and had quite a few groups waiting anxiously at the door for a table.

The service here was spectacular - I'm used to surly waiters and waitresses at sushi places in the burbs. We were seated directly next to the door, and when I hesitated (as I mentioned, it was bitterly cold this evening), the waiter offered to bring out a space heater for our table, which he quickly did. The service was quick throughout the meal, despite the full house, and always given with a smile.

The range of food available on the menu was quite extensive. Udon and miso soup, hot dishes, terriyaki, tempura, wantons and dumplings, and of course sashimi, suhi, hand rolls and maki rolls. I was surprised at some of the unique rolls on tap, particularily the Fire House Roll (banana and avacado on the inside, tuna and tempura bits on the outside - very interesting taste and would order again) and what I think was called the Everything Roll, which like its namesake, had a bit of everything. We also ordered some spicy salmon crispy rolls and yam rolls, which were both exceptionally fresh and tasty.

The only \"disappointment\" was when it came time for dessert, the ice cream came in portions of about a tablespoon and a half. Being a red bean ice cream fan, and only being able to get this at a sushi restuarant, I really look forward to the dessert course. It was a little embarassing after ordering dessert once to order it 3 more times. So I would recommend ordering a few portions to begin with, or even better if you have a group - order several portions and share :) Makes you look like less of a fatty ordering 5 ice creams :P

For $20.99 for an all you can eat dinner, you really can't beat this place for quality and service, and most of all, location. See ya, overpriced a la carte Toronto sushi joints!"}
{"text":"I always loved coming to aji sai, their sushi is always delicious, many rolls to choose from, ones that you have never seen at other ayce. I love all the choices especially the baked mussels! The service had improved over the years and the people that they have now are more attentive and smiling. We had a child with us under 5 years old and one of the waiters was talking to him about his toy, and asked him several questions about what his toy can do, this guy was great!"}
{"text":"Took Vivian V here the other day and I have to say, they just keep impressing me each time I go.  

Micki nailed it when she said they fight over picking up your napkin!  My glass was never empty, and the plates of sushi didn't stop flowing.  I even got Viv hooked on edamame.

As usual the place was packed, but we didn't have to wait long.  The food was stellar and Viv and I had some good laughs at some of the patrons expenses - trust me, if you were there you would have too.

We rolled out so full of yummy butterfish, miso soup, sesame chicken and good good mango ice cream.

This was my first check in location using the iPhone App...very cool.  

Check it out!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with a medium-sized group at a somewhat busy hour (weekday lunch). It's one of the better AYCE sushi places downtown but nothing spectacular.

Service was all right. We only ordered about 3 rounds before they told us it was the last order, which seemed kind of abrupt, especially considering one of our party didn't arrive until later.

The food itself is better quality than a lot of the other sushi places in Toronto but not amazing. My expectations are never that high for AYCE sushi quality anyway so the quality was about right. I was disappointed with the variety, though. Maybe I don't go to AYCE sushi enough, but I'm used to more fish options than just salmon and tuna.

The winning point is really the price. This is definitely some of the cheapest AYCE sushi you can get in the area.

I'd recommend this place if you've got a big sushi craving on a budget, but not for a real fine dining sushi experience."}
{"text":"The sushi here is pretty decent.  Probably the best all you can eat because it includes specialty rolls and pretty much all the bells and whistles of any typical sushi place.  For 21.99, you can't go wrong.
I really enjoyed their plum wine and the waiters are especially friendly and patient.  
They have a wide selection of rolls and I loved the butterfish sashimi.  Mostly because I've never seen or heard of it before.
This place is rather busy so I suggest you come early because their last call is 10:30 on the weekends."}
{"text":"My favourite AYCE sushi restaurant in Toronto, for sure. 

The service here is fantastic, the food is good, and the menu is so diverse. I'm surprised by the reviews saying the service is poor. I have been at least half a dozen times and, besides the occasional forgotten \"round\", I have no complaints. They don't pressure you to eat quickly, even though there is usually quite the line up. And the style of the service (lots of servers serving lots of tables at once) makes it conducive to ordering lots of small rounds. This is perfect to not overdo it on your order and to try out different things at the table to see what everyone wants more of. The variety is also great for my friends who don't like sushi.

Why it doesn't get 5 stars:
1. The sushi isn't the best I've ever had. It's fine for the price. 
2.The lunch menu is very limited."}
{"text":"This is our \"go to\" place for the dinner special. Best deal in town - always fresh, hot and delicious and the sushi is excellent!ff"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi fresh and tasty and the all you can eat deal is well worth it. We started with seaweed salad, tofu soup , tempura veg and four different sushi rolls."}
{"text":"We most part the food was pretty good.  My only complaint is that my favorite dishes tend to be Spicy Tuna and Salman Rolls.  Well, they were good but not that spicy.  The atmosphere was nice as it was busy enough but not crazy.  The service was quite quick, but at the same time patient.  The food was very good for a cost efficient all you can eat sushi shop."}
{"text":"So I want to start of saying that I've been a customer to this restaurant multiple times so this is not a first impression review.
Due to the fact it's across from my hs made it easily accessible for me and my friends.

As for the rating, I've experienced a LOT better.
The service first of all is not too good.
Once, one of the \"head\" was training a server and when he made a mistake, she smacked him on the head infront of me and my friends. What kind of respect and sight is that for us to see?
The servers always seem to ignore you when you call for them multiple times.
On several occasions, the staff kicked out my group of friends while we were eating because \"lunch time\" was almost over.
I'd like to also mention the fact that they HAVE MESSED UP MY ORDER EVERY SINGLE TIME I'VE BEEN THERE. Never once have I recieved everything I ordered. On multiple occasions, they gave my food to the tables surrounding me.

As for the food, the food is worth the money knowing its an all you can eat restaurant, but the service of the staff makes me pick Aji Sai as the last resort for food in this plaza.

Though this may sound like a harsh review, I'm only stating the facts.
Thanks."}
{"text":"don't go here unless you're stuck.  can't understand why it's so busy.  picked up 3 rolls and a miso soup to take out. very basic. 

If you've ever eaten good sushi, you wouldn't be satisfied here."}
{"text":"I always wanted to come here since it's supposedly one of the best AYCE. So while I was in downtown I decided to walk in and try it out. This place doesn't have drinks included and even if you get charged for a drink on the side it isn't unlimited refills. I found that this place didn't have much variety for an AYCE. My friend accidentally dropped his chopsticks and when I asked for another pair I got attitude instead. The sushi isn't bad but it's not amazing. Dinner for one in total was 28$ not including tips. If I was rude at all I would understand why the waitress would be extra rude but it was unnecessary since a restaurant should have a standard customer service knowledge. Even if I go by downtown again I would never come back here."}
{"text":"One bitten twice shy? In my case, once bitten? When was that?

So went back to AS for their weekend dinner buffet, cuz a man needs sushi ayce to survive.

Noticed that it's a bit more expensive, like 7 bucks more on the weekend. No biggie, understandable since its supposed to be a special menu. But does it have soft shelled crab or escargot or something else more special and expensive on their weekend dinner menu? NO!

All that this place offers are their bland, avocado filled \"special rolls\". Each special roll that we had, no matter what it's origin or ethnicity, be it Philadelphia or California or a Dynamite or a Spider, was one big avocado/cucumber party!  Other places I've been to offer these special rolls 24/7. Tres disappointing.

Also, our server returned our menu back to us saying we had ordered more than we could chew. I looked her in the eye and sent it right back saying \"Lady, black is a slimming color and my shirt hides my girth well!\" Of course, my table finished our menu ninja style and even ordered some more!

And of course in typical Aji Sai fashion they forgot to bring several items that we had ordered.

But seriously,fair folks of Toronto, especially those denizens South of Bloor, wake up and smell the sushi! Aji Sai is pretty crap. There has to be a happy medium between the heavenly Sushi Kaji and the abysmal Aji Sai. Please enlighten me. Better still invite me."}
{"text":"It's hard to review this restaurant. Probably because almost every negative and positive comment you'll read is true. But please consider what this restaurant is: one of the busiest AYCE places in Toronto and it's intended to be a cheaper-end sushi place.

This is the second Aji Sai location I've visited for AYCE and it was quite delicious. They have a great selection of rolls and the quality of their fish is not too shabby. The pricing is pretty decent, but I would recommend that you go to this place for their AYCE rather than their meals or individual rolls.

Fair warning, this place is busy as hell and not necessarily the most organized. While you could tell that the host was trying his best to keep everyone waiting to be seated and balance his other responsibilities, he was being overwhelmed. The waiters and waitresses are fairly friendly but the service is slow.

The decor at this Aji Sai is pretty nice. All and all, if you want a decent selection of sushi at an AYCE and don't care too much about service, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Their new renovations are really nice! The menu also has many great options and the sushi is delicious. Recommend the salmon rose, cheese won tons, and ribs. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"The shrimp was old and tough. The seaweed salad tasted like old fishtank (I'm not at all exaggerating). A lot of the rolls left a weird after taste. As me and my date got furthe rinto the night, we order more and more conservatively. Even the Chicken teriyaki and General chicken were poorly done. 

We actually got to the point where we just ordered hash browns. Even these were unappealing at best. The only thing I found adequate was the Mackeral cut I ordered, and the vanila ice cream at the end.

About all I took away from this restaurant's AYCE is that I probably couldn't do much worse in the future. Though, honestly, for the following to days, I didn't want to consider sushi again for a while.

This is the first time I've ever not tipped at all. I still feel cheated."}
{"text":"Best AYCE sushi restaurant in the Bayview area! Not only is a comfy but the sashimi is on point. Fresh and plentiful. Order the coconut shrimp and fresh shrimp sashimi if you are shrimp fan like myself. The price for Friday night is also very reasonable. I would avoid the beef sashimi though...I've had better."}
{"text":"Considering that lunch was only $14.99 for AYCE sushi, it was very good and delicious! The menu selection was big and there was a lot of options to choose from. The only thing was the rice was lacking flavor therefore making the sushi a little bit bland. 

The atmosphere was very nice and comfortable. The service was very good as the waiters were friendly and helpful.

I would definitely recommend this place to a friend! The food other than sushi was also surprisingly good and I would for sure come back."}
{"text":"$27 for all-you-can-eat sushi...during dinner hours?! As a NYC girl, this is unheard of, so imagine my excitement when hearing about this place!

The all-you-can-menu is actually pretty extensive, and has several options. Looking at all these negative reviews, I must've come on a good night because our servers were very polite and fast with our orders. 

Obviously, you get what you pay for in terms of quality of sushi, but the ones we ordered were quite good! Besides the sashimi and sushi rolls, they have various other options, such as fried rice, dumplings - all of which I enjoyed. I was probably the most disapppointed with their sushi pizza as I've definitely had better ones before in the Toronto and NYC area.

Make sure you save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"First of all, the service was terrible. The server was rude to the max. 
Not one food was good even the wasabi was terrible. 
Can soda was the best part of the meal. 
Can't believe we had to wait for this crap."}
{"text":"What a disappointing AYCE experience!! 

I came here on a recommendation of a co-worker, who said it was the best AYCE in the city. To give her the benefit of the doubt, she did recommend we go for lunch, and we went for a 9:30 PM dinner, SO perhaps that was some of the problem, but I can't imagine this place gets much better. 

Service: MEH. Really unresponsive and sometimes just rude, they didn't come by frequently enough and when they did generally kept a sour look on their faces.

Food: DOUBLE MEH. Probably some of the worst sushi I've had in recent times, and I get desperate some times and eat the stuff at the grocery store, so this is saying a lot. Nothing stood out as excellent, even the rice was kind of crappy. Sashimi slices were basically non-existent, and a lot of what we ordered just never showed. 

Overall experience: Pretty much terrible. I was too full off crappy food and just sad that I had given them so much of my money. 

Don't bother, the city is too full of decent sushi to waste your time here!"}
{"text":"If you must go to an AYCE, Aji is pretty much the only place to go near Queen/Spadina. It's a pretty large setup with plenty of booths, and you can pretty much walk in at most hours without a reservation. Not worth your $$ for dinner, but at 17 big kahunas (taxes in) for lunch, it's not terrible.

Food is typical, and average at best. As expected, sushi has too much rice, but that's not a big deal. The roll selections are decent, with plenty of options for noob sushi lovers as well. Green Dragon Roll had good amounts of avocado, and didn't skimp on eel - pleasant surprise! Hot food though was meh. Had a few dishes including karage, tempura, teriyaki.. basically good to fill your stomach. If you still have room at the end, they have a handful of ice cream options and dessert too."}
{"text":"food is mediocre. Service is horrible

waited over half an hour to get portion of my first order and they never delivered the rest. the story continued to the very last second my visit. And No it was not busy when i got there. 

I think they are just CHEAP.  they downsized my order and when i asked them for more it took them forever !"}
{"text":"This place is very hit or miss, and unfortunately, my most recent time was a huge miss! 

To start off positively, it is a nice, clean location offering ACYE which seems like an anomaly in the downtown area. Service is typically average and menu has a decent variety. Unfortunately, last time my boyfriend and I went, the staff misplaced part of our order, leaving us sitting for over 20min after being served our first portion. When we told the staff, they acted quickly; however, the food they brought looked rushed and did not taste fresh. Both my boyfriend and I ended up feeling sick for a few days after. 

Probably won't be returning, but can't say every experience has been awful."}
{"text":"Food quality is ok here, service is a bit slow. My main problem though is that they use way too much rice for all their sushi. I don't eat raw seafood so pretty much all my rolls and sushi was carbs. I had to remove half the rice from each item I got, that's how bad it was."}
{"text":"I went to Aji Sai with the expectation that it as at least a decent sushi place.  Unfortunately, from the start the menu is limited for an AYCE sushi place.  

- They did not have sashimi nor unagi.  
- The seaweed salad was cut with lettuce (did the the price of seaweed go up?).
- The sushi portions were small.

What was good!
- Grilled salmon belly

Everything else was mediocre at best...not the worse I've had but it isn't on my list of restaurants to return to in the near future.

END"}
{"text":"If you love sashimi, do not come here. This was one of the few restaurants I have visited where I could not decide  an overall rating. $13.99 all you can eat for lunch  is a very good deal, but not when sashimi is included on this menu. The other dishes on the AYCE menu were very good except for the seaweed salad which had a weird cream sauce on it. Service levels were fine, but the wait time for food was a little long. Be prepared for 'evil stares' from the staff if you don't finish off anything you order. I would have given this place 4 stars if they had included sashimi on the AYCE menu. On the other hand if you are not a big sashimi eater, definitely stop by here for lunch, as they do have a good selection of hot dishes and rolls."}
{"text":"Interesting to see that my first review is such a rating, and it is exactly for that reason that I have started 'Yelping'.

If I could, I wouldn't even give one star to this place. We were looking for a close and decent ayce and knowing this one has been around for a while we assumed it would be ok.

There goes the saying \"Asian eyes\" and it couldn't be more true than the waiters here - blind, you might even call them. After sitting down for close to 15 minutes, it was like a mission trying to get any waiter's attention to take your order; it was quite obvious they are understaffed. I understand you are busy and trying to keep up with the tables, but that is no excuse to ignore customers. 

When we finally managed to find someone for our order, the food didn't take long to arrive but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary, which I was glad because at least it wasn't terrible. Might I mention we purposely ordered a larger batch on the first round because we feel like it would take forever to find another waiter for our second round? And of course, they didn't disappoint. We were trying to order desserts but of course to no avail; I distinctly remember two waiters seeing me with my hand up but was IGNORED? To my amuse the table beside got fed up with the waiting and yelled out \"I've been waiting to order for 20 minutes!\" She was acknowledged alright... but her order wasn't taken until another 15 minutes later... when I was finally successful in waving down the waiter for my dessert order, the food that came was totally wrong.

To avoid wasting more time and energy, we decided to call for the bill and surprise surprise, that was the fastest thing that happened. Needless to say we gave $0 ZERO tips; we honestly felt like we got zero service at this place, so seat yourself in a corner and think about why, Aji Sai. 

Customer service is a huge thing for me, and although I don't expect you to be entertaining me and following me around like a sales, I do appreciate some sort of acknowledgment, and not having to go through frustration and anger to eat at a restaurant. I honestly cannot understand why this place has so many people going there, considering what they offer, if anything at all."}
{"text":"This place is by far the worst restaurant/dining experience i've ever had in toronto. 
I came here about 2 years ago for lunch on a weekday with one other person. I specifically came here because i heard positive things about it on yelp, but I was extremely disappointed. 

The service was slow, the servers were rude and just chatted in mandarin in front of my table while giving me uncomfortable looks from times to time.  

the worst part about this place is actually the food... all the raw salmon used in the sushi were no fresh, the oyster roll was super fishy, the sushi pizza tasted so wrong that i was sure i was going to be sick the next day. avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I was so stingy with the extra star. Aji Sai is a go-to! Both dine-in and delivery. Solid."}
{"text":"We came to Aji Sai for a group dinner on a busy Saturday night.  Luckily, we had made reservations but there was still a bit of a wait for available tables to accommodate everyone.  

A few people in our group were delayed so it worked out but I don't know what would have happened if all of us had arrived at the same time as there was only a table available for four people at our reservation time (we were a group of 13).

The order process was chaotic.  We all ordered a variety of different rolls and they arrived on two huge platters with no way to tell the rolls apart.  We're not picky eaters so we dug in but I specifically ordered the Firehouse Roll to try and it was no where to be seen.  Someone else ordered the Enoki Mushroom Rolls, which didn't arrive either.

The rolls that we did get were good but again, I couldn't make note of which ones I liked best because I had no idea the names of them.

I personally am not a big eater so I tend to avoid all-you-can-eat places, although I would consider coming back if I ever decide to take up competitve eating for sport.  Also, I'd probably limit my group to 4-6 people so that we could keep a handle on the ordering process."}
{"text":"Okay, the food was decent. I'd give it 4 stars if I was just reviewing the food. But seriously, service was sh*t. I visited this place twice, and they were both bad experiences. 

During my last visit, I arrived at the restaurant an hour before closing and they told me the kitchen would close in 30 minutes. I thought okay, I have enough time to order... so we got the all-you-can-eat special and ordered our first round. I asked the waiter for a simple maki roll recommendation, and he refused to give a recommendation because he was afraid that if we don't like it, we won't finish it (and he'd have to charge us a fee for it). I thought that was kind of rude and discourteous. But anyway, we made the first batch order, as well as a separate take-out order. 20 minutes later and we still haven't received a single dish. Meanwhile, the table in front of us were getting waves after waves of dishes of sushi. So I thought that was a really retarded way of distributing the orders. Why would you give more sushi to the table who still haven't finished their first dish?. They could've given our first dish a little earlier. 

So we waited for our first item to arrive, and when it came, it was our take out order. Unbelievable... why would you give me the take out order first???? You're suppose to give that to us last!!! Anyway, when we finally received our sushi and sashimi, i thought it was pretty fresh and tasty. Though I don't think it makes up for the horrible service. When it was time for last call, the waiter didn't even bother to tell us. All we wanted were ice cream.... and there's last call for ICE CREAM! they expect us to place an order for ice cream when the \"kitchen\" closes; before we even finish our food. Seriously, If you care about service at all, avoid this place. There are plenty of better sushi places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place is not worth your money. Not a single cent. The service is terrible. The waiters don't give a **** about you, because they are understaffed and have too many people to serve. The food is awful. Yes, I know it's a buffet and I should not expect Michelin-starred restaurant food, but my experience totally ruined my impression of the place. To top it off, my wife and I felt a bit nauseated several hours later. Aji Sai, you can be sure that I will NEVER step my foot back in your establishment."}
{"text":"My parents love aji sai and today after work my mom asked me to grab some takeout she ordered. We ordered 3 orders of the dynamite maki (8 pieces each), 1 cali roll, 2 avo rolls, 1 yam temp roll, 1 spicy salmon hand roll, and 1 other veg roll something with an S (it has mayo, avo and temp pieces inside and it is shaped like a tear drop). They placed it all on a big tray and it came out to $49.12 - they give a discount if you come pick it up. 
My family usually comes for the all-you-can-eat menu but we were just too tired to sit at a restaurant today. The take out is good, rice is fresh and so are the ingredients. 
During the weekends and evenings the place is PACKED and they hand out numbers for a table, you have to get a little aggressive to make sure other people dont bug infront - have had it almost happen to me!
Overall, good sushi close to home :)"}
{"text":"I don't really have anything to add on top of what other reviewers have said. Aji Sai has very nice decor and looks modern and nothing really to complain about. Their sushi is on par with other AYCE Japanese restaurants. They also have a pretty large selection of choices of food.

For me, a big factor on a good AYCE restaurant is their enoki beef rolls (I believe they call it something different here). I am a huge fan of these appetizers and eat a dinner's worth of them. I don't really like the taste of the rolls at Aji Sai comparatively to other places.

For me, I prefer Sushi Island to this place, but this place is still one of the few AYCE Japanese restaurants near downtown."}
{"text":"I visited Toronto a few years ago and I have to say that this is 1 place that sticks in my mind, time and time again. 

I'm so upset that I didn't arrive at their lunch buffet earlier (2pm when it closed at 2:30pm) and more than once during our trip. It's literally the best $12.99 I could ever spend and I've considered making a trip back to Toronto JUST FOR THIS PLACE. 

It's All You Can Eat and from what I can remember, they have an extensive menu of over 50 items and speciality rolls as well. They make them fresh to order (not buffet style) and the truly was honestly divine. You have to make sure you finish all of your sushi or I believe they will charge you. But for all you can eat and at that price, I don't know where you will find a better deal. If you know of a place, please let me know!

The service was excellent even though we arrived towards the end of lunch. I can see how this place can get packed quickly during the lunch hour so make sure you get there early!

Love this place. I've gotta go back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this AYCE sushi restaurant a total of 5 times, but I think after what happened the last time I went here with a friend about 2 weeks ago makes me think twice about going back anytime soon.  As there aren't too many choices in downtown for 'good' AYCE sushi places, I would consider this one as one of the better ones as it usually gets pretty busy.  

Came here for dinner and ordered: seaweed salad, sashimi (salmon, butterfish, mackerel, surf clam), edamame, shrimp tempura, cheese wonton, beef teriyaki, chicken cutlet, salmon belly, and maki rolls (dynamite, soft shell crab, and green dragon). So the 'thing' that happened which grossed me out was that I found a hair in my dynamite roll! I'm not kidding..and I know it wasn't mine as it's highly unlikely that it fell off my head and sandwiched itself into the sushi roll...ick..we didn't mention it to the server as the discovery was made in the middle of our meal with more food coming. Then I found myself inspecting the other foods we ordered.  On the other hand, I really enjoyed the cheese wontons, which we ordered twice.  It was kinda strange but we noticed the first time there were 4 cheese wontons, and the second time it came there were only 2 cheese wontons. Hmm..maybe they were really popular that night and they had to conserve some?! This isn't my favourite AYCE sushi restaurant but if I had to pick one in downtown, I'd probably suggest this one."}
{"text":"This place offers two menus AYCE or per order. Came with husband and kids, we went for AYCE

It's $21 for adults $11.99 for kids and $6.99 for toddler/preschool 
The service was bad really rude servers, but the sashimi and sushi rolls were really good. 
Sashimi was fresh doesn't taste frozen like a lot of other AYCE places.
Our fav was the green dragon roll. The eel was tasty and the avocados were fresh. 

Dessert menu was limited about 4 different ice cream Flavours. 

Will come back, hopefully catch them on a good day!"}
{"text":"We went there for lunch and their selection is a lot smaller, but the price is also a lot cheaper. For 12.99 you can get all kinds of special rolls, nigiri, hot foods, dessert, starters, etc.

The only thing that I thought was missing that made me sad, aside from the expected lack of sashimi which I don't eat anyway, was that they didn't have shrimp tempura. They did have tempura everything else. Thankfully that was made up for with rolls that had shrimp tempura. I was satisfied. 

I didn't find the salmon in the spicy salmon hand roll to be that great though. I've had better.

I think my favourite thing about the restaurant is its service. This is probably the first and only AYCE restaurant that has good service. The servers there are really friendly and prompt and will tell you about the food even without you asking (such as when I asked for the wakame salad, he told me it's dried seaweed layered on top of green salad).

They give student discount, so bring your student card :)"}
{"text":"Ordered a large sashimi. They did a complete bait and switch. The picture has four pieces of tuna. Instead of tuna we received the cooked pollock imitation crab. Total and utter fail. Please see attached picture."}
{"text":"Took a chance on this place and it delivered. Nothing extraordinary, but satisfied my sushi craving! Service a bit slow. Very busy place, decent decor on the more modern side."}
{"text":"Lunch AYCE is a great deal! Dinner time is awesome for a date night and the food has always been on point. Service is great and the overall experience has me coming back multiple times a month"}
{"text":"I visited Aji Sai last night with some friends who had been to another location.  I've been to a lot of sushi restaurants and this one was by far the worst.  Aside from the horrible service, which sometime is expected in these all you can eat place, the sushi pieces were tiny, everything tasted the same, and each piece had way too much rice.  The restaurant was nicely decorated, but I am not planning on visiting this place again."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and I can't believe I've never rated it.
This is probably one of my favourite AYCE Sushi joints in town but beware the wait... during lunch the lineup are long!

Once you are in the service is pretty quick. I highly recommend the Firehouse Roll and the Black dragon roll which as amazing here. Sashimi is only available for dinner but it's fresh and worth paying extra for at night."}
{"text":"Great service and food quality here. Came here for dinner with a party of 15. We all ordered AYCE. Everything is cooked fresh and prepared to order. There are about 4-6 sushi chefs at any given time preparing your sushi. Beware if you don't eat all your fish they may charge you $1 for each. We enjoyed the salmon, butterfish nigiri, green dragon roll, salmon hand rolls, Ikayaki, and any of the spicy rolls. We left stuffed and happy. Buffet for around $23 is was well worth it. Staff does need a bit of training. When asking about the menu, they only point to the menu pictures and no. Not very informative, but the food makes up for it. Highlight had to be the buttery salmon that melts in your mouth. Save your stomach for desert because it is also included. We ordered the mango and red bean ice cream. Both delicious with creamy milk and strong fruit flavors. Everything was beautifully plated and rolls come out in 5-10 minutes. Wait times can be long so its best to reserve in advance. I do wish they had the low sodium green soy sauce. The red once is just way to salty."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure how you can make sushi taste boring or awful, but Aji Sai has done it.

Quite an achievement, I think.

All you can eat sushi should not mean terrible quality, but that's precisely how it is at Aji Sai. My friend warned me, even, walking in, that it would be sub-par, but I don't think I was quite prepared for how genuinely bad the sushi is.

I'm pleasantly surprised I didn't get sick, and that's not a thought you want to be having after eating at a sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"I LOVE sushi.  My last meal would be sushi.   I would choose sushi over chocolate any day.  Ok, I think I made my point.

My girlfriend and I ended up at Aji Sai a few months ago for AYCE (All You Can Eat) sushi.  Been there multiple times, but not enough.  I knew it was too good to be true when I remembered that soy sauce was wheat-based (I'm trying to avoid gluten).  Err!  Sushi without soy sauce is like peanut butter without the jam.  But I survived with plain maki for the night.  The good news is that I could actually TASTE the fish.

THE MENU: Massive for an AYCE place.  I challenge you to try it everything on it.   Go for the green tea ice cream for dessert (I'll live vicariously through you, now that dairy is taboo on this diet).

OUR ORDER:  I can't remember them all but here goes - Aji Sai roll, Excellent roll, Tuna/Mango roll, Salmon/Snapper roll, Wakame salad.  I know I'm missing a few, but honestly, they're all great.  Excellent roll was up there if you like tempura and butterfish."}
{"text":"The best all-you-can eat sushi restaurant I've found in Toronto. A wide selection of rolls and sashimi; it always tastes fresh and flavourful (especially for an AYCE menu).

The price is totally reasonable - if you have a decent appetite like I do, you'll absolutely get your money's worth. Try it for lunch if you're craving sushi and it's even better value!"}
{"text":"The food is still good, however the service went downhill since couple of years ago. When i was paying, the asian lady got really mad and gave me attitude when i left her less than a 15% tip, funny"}
{"text":"I went here upon recommendation for the AYCE.  To sum it up, this place is pretty meh.  
The crab salad was crisp and delicious and the noodle soup was hot and flavourful.  They had a variety of things on their AYCE menu including meat skewers, fried rice, and ice cream.  Unfortunately, the sushi itself was ok and didn't taste as fresh as I'd like.
We came near the end of lunch and it was a little hectic.  However, they have a good amount of seating so we didn't have to wait long.  Service was very poor.  I had to constantly motion over our server.  At some point I gave up and asked another server to wait on us instead.
Personally, if I was going to do sushi I'd go elsewhere, even though it's relatively cheap."}
{"text":"ok so went there on the 14th the experience started out good but service deterioted service started out fast and then slowed down but the thing that was the kicker was the fact that the server spilled some some sauce fromm left over food from someone elses table all over my $100.00 j lindeberg golf shirt. She made no attempt to help me get my shirt  cleaned up or anything. When the bill came i was expecting to get my meal for free because that is something that has happened to me before at other restaurants and have got free dinner. The fact that she went back to the other servers and told them and they started laughing and looking over at me. I was not impressed."}
{"text":"I have been to Aji Sai and number of times and it is for the most part average. Tonight we reserved a table for 6 and were seated in the cozy side room. There was what looked like ice cream spilled on the floor and spattered on the seat that the server didn't seem to notice so we had to ask her to wipe it up. The service was not exactly enthusiastic but it was regular and all of our requests (that we had to say quickly before the server ran away) were addressed promptly. The food was very fresh; the rolls are regular sized, not the miniature ones you get at some AYCE places and the tempura, teriyaki and tea was all good.The fried banana was a tad overdone, but the ice cream was creamy and all in all we had an enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"I've definitely had better food. There are a lot better choices nearby.. not necessarily sushi, but trust me on this.. Also, I don't always expect good service at AYCE, but service was noticeably slow. Oh and in the winter don't sit anywhere near the door because this place does not like to use their heaters... we ate with our jackets on"}
{"text":"I WANT to like this place. It's affordable (ish), conveniently located and quick with bringing my tummy food.

Brought my SO there last week, but was sorely disappointed. The service was inconsistent at best, the sashimi was ok (the surf clam was TINY!). We've been there a few other times, and were looking for an AYCE that has better sashimi selection than Sashimi Island on College (it only has a few options, odd at best). It does, but at a cost.

We ordered miso soups, wakame salad, seasoned seaweed salad, shrimp tempura, spicy salmon handrolls, assorted sashimi, two handrolls, as well as three maki rolls. The 'awesome roll' (or something equally lame, it doesn't deserve capitalization) was mushy at best. Neither of the two rolls we received had any discernible texture. That third one? (Yeah, your math was right) never bothered showing up. When we asked about it it took them ten minutes to tell us that they no longer served Spider Rolls. REALLY? I get the idea of running out, but I do not understand why it takes the better part of an hour to inform the customers. If I order something for dinner, I don't expect to hear about it when ordering dessert.

So yeah, we're looking for a new AYCE sushi place. If you know of one in the core, hit me up?"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi place; I was a bit afraid of the quality.  Surprisingly, the fish was quite fresh.  Good varieties:  sashimi, appetizers, rolls. bowls. and desserts.  The tuna mango roll was that good.  I couldn't make out the mangoes even when I isolated them from the  roll."}
{"text":"Great sashimi, and they don't put too much rice on the rolls. The tempura was decent as well. They tried to give us a few dishes we didn't order and forgot a few as well but when does that not happen at AYCE?"}
{"text":"Cheap AYCE, but i guess thats what you pay for. The sushi isnt the greatest, quite dry. I had a difficult time actually finishing my sushi because I just could not get myself to swallow the pieces. The handrolls were better but not by much
The menu is very diverse, which is a pro. Even the desserts were so-so as my friends and I struggled to finish the tiny piece of cheesecake and tiramisu because the flavors were just not there"}
{"text":"The only reason that I will give this place a star (aside from the technical reason that 0 star is not an option) is because they offer some nice warm dishes. I like to have some vegetables to balance it out since sushi has quite a bit of meat and rice. The amount of avocado in their rolls are increasing. I ordered a black dragon roll and I could not taste the eel unless I eat it by itself. The entire roll was made up of avocado. And yes, the tempura shrimp in there was soggy. Also, we made ONE order and thr waitress said we can only order one more time. Um, how is that AYCE... In terms of food...it might be me only, but  the two times that I have been here, I got a stomach ache afterwards. Oh, and lunch is $13.99 now."}
{"text":"Ayce ayce, ayce ayce. This is a common chant amongst my friends whenever we're deciding where to go to eat. And when it's a large crowd, ayce normally wins. In case you're not sure what ayce stands for, it's all you can eat. For many of my friends, ayce almost directly translate to Japanese. That's right, not an Americanize buffet place or an Indian joint, it's gotta be Japanese... specifically sushi.

So with a group pushing around 15 people, we headed over to Aji Sai on Queen for ayce sushi. This place has been here for a while and a popular choice downtown. Word to the wise, definitely make reservations if you can. Whether it's for a table of 2 or for a table of many, make reservations. The wait can be pretty brutal and they won't seat you till you have 75% of your guest there. The place is decorated well, nothing great but it's definitely not a dump. I would call it the typical modern asian fusion type of decor that has flooded our food markets with.

We got our table and we order almost immediately. The selection is quite good but the only major different between lunch and dinner is probably the ability to order sashimi.  And the sashimi here is alright. I would say average to maybe just slightly above average. For the salmon peeps out there, it's alright you won't complain nor will you sing their praises. The hot food wasn't bad and with such an extensive menu, you can get lost. The shrimp tempura was fresh and nicely battered.  We ordered wayy too many meat dishes so be careful when ordering as the they give you a fair amount with each order.  Didn't like the cooked fish as they didn't feel fresh. And when they're not fresh and you have a huge portion, it's gonna be a long night.

Now the maki and sushi we had were all rolled pretty well. They didn't over stuff it with rice or cheap out by giving you more vegs. You did get what you ordered. I'm a big maki fan and though all the ingredients and portions were there, something just didn't add up. The flavour wasn't there. Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad at all, you can eat much worse maki, but just... Didn't meet my expectations. Had better but very similar to New Sushi Island. The sushi was okay. The fish to rice ratio was good which is very important.  Angela's a huge salmon sushi fan and she was able to put her stamp of approval.  Service wasn't bad but they did forget a couple of items on our order. So you may have to remind them or reorder a couple of times.

Overall, Aji Sai wasn't bad. The place looks well kept and they do appear to care about cleanliness and quality.  It's quite popular so service can drop once it gets busy. And you're probably bound to have a few items missed. But the food selection is pretty good and the quality is a little bit above average. Is it the best ayce sushi in town, no... but you can do much worse."}
{"text":"Found a cockroach in my salad... beware. Exited after this; never had a chance to try the rest of the food."}
{"text":"Not sure why all my friends go here probably because it cheap for Ayce. But I personally don't  like the food here. The service can be very slow at times. The last time I was here and probably my last time was when I found this long piece of hair wrapped around a piece of my salmon in my seafood udon. I had 97% of my udon finished before i discover the long strand of thick hair....I guess it was too late to make a complaint  at the point and I need to get back to work. Oh well no coming back for me."}
{"text":"It seems to me that at lunch they ONLY do All You Can Eat. I love AYCE sushi, but if you just want to order a few specific items on a quick work lunch it might not be what you're looking for. They seem blown away if you aren't into AYCE. Are they only AYCE? I still don't know. 

Anyway, it suited my growling belly today so that was swell, and it was only 12.99.

I was a bit annoyed that certain items are only on the \"dinner menu\" which you CAN get at lunch but it costs more. This included edamame and ebi (shrimp) sushi and all sashimi, I found this a bit strange. They are AYCE staples in my mind, and aren't necessarily the most expensive items. It's not like I asked for soft shell crab... ok... I did... but it was a no go... but I understand that one.

The sushi was fresh, but not the freshest, and I'll go back when I want to indulge over lunch, but it wasn't the best. 

The servers were sweet and on top of everything, but it just wasn't the great experience co-workers told me it would be."}
{"text":"Aji Sai is by far the best AYCE sushi restaurant in the GTA and it becomes very obvious of that when you visit as it can be packed with a huge lineup no matter what time you choose to visit. They have the best selection of Sashimi (only at dinner) Sushi and maki and their specialty rolls are fantastic with plenty to choose from as well."}
{"text":"Not a fan of huge line ups, but it was not too bad this time. Had a chance to catch up with my buddy from Montreal who was feeling the Asian vibe. Oh it's Asian alright!!!

The sashimi/sushi are fresh and delicious!! Oh, you have to try the short ribs. I dont think this item is on the menu but ask for it.... It's REALLY good!! Their portions are generous and service is overall good despite being so busy....

I would definitely go again, given that it's my second time already)!!!"}
{"text":"First and foremost, the service here is the worst. Rude servers. They don't bring everything you order and will bring the bill when the time limit is up. Correction: they bring the bill before your time limit and want you out ASAP. I seriously can't stand the horrible service here. Which sucks because the food is awesome. They have some great rolls and decent quality food. The lunch special is totally worth dealing with the servers, but the dinner price is not worth the abuse. 

In fact, I'm STILL waiting for my sushi pizza. They never bring me the sushi pizza. I order it even time I go, and they never bring it. Ever. 

If you want good sushi in the neighborhood, check out To-Ne across the street."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying the service here is VERY hit or miss. Some days I'll go and have awesome service. Other times, the servers are all in horrible moods or just generally don't care about serving anyone anything. 

Aside from the service, I've never had a problem with any of the food. It's not THE best AYCE sushi in the city, but I keep coming back for those damn delicious Firehouse Rolls! I can't get enough - they're my absolute favourite things to order here. There's banana in it which sounds odd to a lot of people at first but you really have to try it.

I'm not a fan of their spring rolls - to me they taste just like the ones you can buy in a big box in grocery store, freezer burn included. I don't even bother ordering those any more.

Their sashimi was okay, but I've had better at most other places. 

As wth most AYCE sushi places, don't forget that they can decide to charge you for leftover food - most of the time they don't charge me if it's just a couple of pieces, but if you've got lots left over you'll definitely get charged.

If you're looking for a quick cheap place for AYCE, this place is great. If you're a sushi connoisseur and looking for top quality, you're better off going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Service was SLLLOOOOOW. we spent 30+ minutes of our 1 hr lunch watching everyone around us - including people that walked in 20 minutes after us - eat while we waited and waited. the staff was extremely unapologetic about it.
They screwed up our order and though we were not completely satisfied we were already 1.5 hours in and could not bother to wait. 
oh and here's the kicker. it's about half an hour since I got back from lunch, and i'm feeling extremely sick.
The actual sushi was okay at best. no tempura shrimp and no edamame.
12.99 is pretty cheap but not worth it for the bad service or if it's gonna make me sick for the next few hours (or more..)"}
{"text":"Ordering was like Russian Roulette. Just order a bunch of things and only half of it will actually come to your table. They were polite enough to replace the missing food with a bug. 
I would consider giving this place a 2/5 stars; however, I'm pretty sure the waiter took more time styling his hair than actually doing his job."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot because it's across the street from my high school but one day my friend and I went in and it was time to pay the bill. The bill read $40.00 meaning $20 each. I told the waitor I'd like to pay my half on debit. When I looked at the machine it read $25. When I asked them for an explanation they could barely give me one. So I said okay nevermind I'll pay in cash and pulled out a 20. They then insisted that I still owed 25 cash. I had to argue with them and explain how this was impossible as the bill read $40 meaning $20 each. Not rocket science! The experience ended with my friend and I walking out of the place yelling back and forth with them. For obvious reasons I put down my 20 and left no tip. Since then I have not been back. The food also sucks."}
{"text":"My friends and I walked in at dinner time.
No one noticed us until we started waving for attention.
The Wakame salad was awesome.
The food was pretty good.
The service I have to say is lacking.
If you call it service at all."}
{"text":"I've been to the downtown location and loved it. Expecting it to be the same experience, I was greatly disappointed. 

The interior decoration was not as appealing as the other location but the seats were comfy. 

When we first came in the servers were very attentive but after the first round, the service went downhill. With the exception of one, all of the servers interacted like a sack of potatoes. They didn't smile and weren't courteous at all and they would stare at you while you eat making you feel very uncomfortable and unwelcome like you're freeloading off them or something. Like the other guy said it was like they wanted to get you in and out as quick as possible. When the bill came and we paid, the server just walked off without saying a word. RUDE MUCH? 

Moving on, the food was EDIBLE. It's just there to fill you up but not really made for enjoyment. Nothing popped out and all of it tasted pretty much the same, BLAND. The vegetable salad was so gross with random creamy orange dressing, not the typical dressing that every other japanese restaurant uses. Chicken dishes were dry and tasteless. Most of the non-sushi dishes were soaked in oil but if you don't eat it the server who has been staring intently at you up until this point goes to great lengths to tell you that you will be charged if you waste food.  Sushi had too much rice, and presentation was weak. Some of the sushi was on the verge falling apart. Service really slows down after the first round (they take their time so food moves down and you feel full). Another disappointing aspect is the fact that soft drinks cost extra where as most AYCE sushi places now include it. For 21 bucks a person I would expect a greater amount of effort put into making and presenting of the food and maybe even ipads to order.

What bothers me is that this place gets packed at during dinner time. Why are there so many people when the food, service and value is terrible? If the price was 10 to 15 dollars then I expect this kind of BS experience but what they offer at the given price is unacceptable. 

Another laughable thing that I haven't seen anywhere else where children were charged according to age rather than one all encompassing rate.

I loved the other Aji Sai location and would go there again but this place is one that  I would avoid as it doesn't even come close to the other one. If you're hungry and want to blow through 21 bucks on sub par food I'd recommend going to Burger King or Mcdonald's over this. At least the service there is better.

This place was so bad I literally made a yelp account to give this place a bad review."}
{"text":"Best AYCE Sushi in Toronto!

I've been to many AYCE sushi places in the GTA, this is by far the best. The sashimi is fresh and they have a bigger selection of sushi compared to other AYCE places. You can get any sushi you can think of. It's not run by Japanese, but still great.

The price is also reasonable. Lunch is $12.99 which is awesome, especially since it's downtown. Dinner is $21.99.

The sushi is really good. My favourites are the Bushido roll, Black dragon roll, spicy salmon crispy roll, spicy salmon sushi, and deep-fried cheese wontons. Soooooooo gooood. Satiates my tastebuds and satisfies my sushi-cravings, cause I can eat a lot. My boyfriend, even more.

Service is good. Most of the time they're quick, although sometimes they're a bit slow. 
They mixed up my dessert order a few times when i ask for Deep Fried Banana with Red bean ice cream, they keep giving me vanilla. But my boyfriend always orders the same thing except with Vanilla ice cream, they never mess it up. I guess red bean ice cream is a bit rare here. They always give me the red bean ice cream though after i told them they got it wrong.

It gets reaallllly busy at dinner time on Fridays or Saturdays, so come early or make a reservation, to avoid lining up all the way to the front of the restaurant.

Washrooms...i never went to the washrooms there. The reason is because my friends and boyfriend have used the washrooms before and they all say the same thing: dirty. I can't say for myself as I've never gone to the washrooms there.

Overall, food is great. Best AYCE sushi i've had so far. Nothing fancy, but for the price, beats other AYCE places."}
{"text":"My experiences here have been very hit or miss. Sometimes the service is great, but recently it has been lacking. Sometimes the food is good, but many times they don't bring you what you ordered. The quality is mediocre but all you can eat lunch for $12 isn't so bad. If you're planning on heading here for dinner, I'd recommend that you look elsewhere. For the price and quality you can find better sushi places in the city!"}
