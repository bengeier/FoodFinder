{"text":"Nice authentico burritos, and the roasted jalape√±os are awesome! Not a lot of seating but the service is good and fast! Horchata is homemade and excellent."}
{"text":"Found my new taco spot. The experience was surprisingly gratifying. Cheap and flavorful.  It isn't a very lavish but the food is so worth it. Bring cash. Cash only. Hopefully you don't miss the sign outside stating that or the other 5 inside reminding you of it. Stop and get some cash. The asada- tender, juice and seasoned. When I ordered tripas (not for me, the husband) I was asked how I wanted them, \"tender or crispy?\" that was the first time I've ever been asked. He says they were delicious, I believe him. Ordered a carne asada quesadilla, it wasn't a huge portion like most others but definitely quality over quantity sorta thing. The food IS on the grease side but, hey, I think that's what may make it so delicious. There isn't a huge menu which I appreciate. 10/10 will come again ...tomorrow. 
Oh. I don't know if it's a typical night here but there is a slight chance it may be difficult to order if you don't speak Spanish. Maybe. Shouldn't discourage you from trying it I just wanted to make sure you're prepared lol."}
{"text":"Found this gem on Yelp.  We had 4 different items and all we're great.  Definitely would stop again."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Tulsa, Ok and wanted something inexpensive but good. The reviews were pretty good, so we gave it a shot and I am SO glad we did! I had a taco, and was one of the BEST tacos EVER!! It's a family business and they were VERY friendly! We all enjoyed our food and felt very comfortable! Definitely stopping in when we go back to Arizona!"}
{"text":"This taqueria is by far my favorite in town.
Although the style and decor obviously screams owners are from Sonora, this style taco is the one I grew up with in Sinaloa.
Typical tacos as I know them come with a sprinkle of finely diced cabbage and your choice of tomato sauce or hot sauce.
Their tacos are really delicious, the tortilla selection of corn or flour and the delicious way theyve been warmed in fat from the same meat is heavenly.
Their guacamole is none of that americanized mixed with pico de gallo. It's plain avocado and lightly seasoned to taste.
Dont forget to ask for the side of cebolla asada (roasted onion) and add it to your taco.

My favorite item to order from here are Papanchas.
Which is basically mashed potato made in heaven, with meat on top plus cheese and cabbage and your choice of tomato sauce or chile. Accompanied of your choice of flour or corn tortilla. I dont remember ever seeing Papanchas in Sinaloa, so it's either this restaurants delicious creation or it comes from Sonora. Whoever's idea it was, it was a godsend.

Their breakfasts are also delicious. We made an order of their huevo con jamon (eggs with ham) with a side or refried beans and it was a big order enough to feed two hungry four year olds.
Only downside is that they take only cash.
Still, it won't deter us from calling back again and again :)"}
{"text":"Best tacos hands down! Just opened up and thought I'd go check it out and was blown away. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Great tacos...super spicy and delicious.  Quesadilla was overstuffed and cheesy. Moderately priced for taqueria-$2/taco"}
{"text":"Wow! Let's talk about a hole in the wall. Horrible location. You can't see it from the street. From the outside it doesn't look that great. You walk inside and it doesn't give you a good warm feeling. The menu looks kind of weak. The photos aren't that great. We ordered the quesadilla, chorreadas, and the papanchas. When it's first brought out to your table it looks like everything is over fried and overcooked. The wow factor does not come in visual form. The style of food is from Sonora. This is not your traditional small Taco Shop. However, the food here is amazing. It really catches you off-guard. They serve guacamole salsa in a yellow ketchup bottle and regular salsa and a red ketchup bottle. I can't even begin to describe how awesome the food is. I wanted to order more but was already stuffed. Chances are before I finish this review I'm going to turn around and order more and tried to stuff my face even more. the only thing I can tell you is try it. You really can't go wrong. The menu is small enough or you can try two or three things and fill your belly just fine. Happy getting fat because you ate too much food."}
{"text":"You know it's good when it's cash only!!   Tacos con tortilla de harina are good and the chorreadas (sopes) are fire!!   I also tried a papancha (mashed potatoes with your choice of meat)  wooooooooo!!! Heat!!    Will definitely be back..."}
