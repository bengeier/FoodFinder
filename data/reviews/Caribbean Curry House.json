{"text":"Delicious food! Fast service and clean. The chicken roti is my favourite. I tried other dishes and all were good."}
{"text":"Excellent. Bloody good food - big portions, spicy and dripping with delicious sau---goddamit, I'm actually salivating as I'm writing. I'm calling right now to go pick up some curried goat with plantains. Awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"It'd been about four years since I'd last had a Jerk Chicken, so I was pretty excited about going to this Caribbean restaurant and seeing it on the menu. I wasn't disappointed!

It's not a fancy place, and you certainly wouldn't bring anyone here to impress them, but for a quick fix of great food it's a good option.

The plate came out PILED UP with food. A really generous serving of chicken, a good sized amount of rice and peas (although, this looked somewhat less than freshly prepared) and a heap of salad. The fried plantain was a really nice touch too.

Going to any restaurant and having a decent sized meal of tasty food for under $15 is always a pleasure. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"While on vacation with the family, we went here for lunch after our first choice was closed (permanently). We were pleasantly surprised by the staff, service and food. It was an awesome find, thanks to yelp. We all enjoyed ourselves with familiar dishes from our native Caribbean. Kudos to the owner(s) and cooks!"}
{"text":"Loved the roti here...meat so tender and tasty...clean place, friendly staff..food was fresh and delicious..will be back"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is rated this high, the food comes out fast but it's straight out of the microwave. I ordered a chicken roti plate and my girlfriend ordered a vegetable roti, both were bland and tasteless. Sorry but I wouldn't recommend this place"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place on and off since 2007 (when I was first introduced to carribean food). 

The customer service is so-so, but the food is sooo good! My favourite is the roti (chicken) and my newest love is their stew chicken (to die for!). 

If you are in the area, it's totally worth the detour!"}
{"text":"Un restaurant très bien dans l'ensemble.
La décoration reste assez rustique mais l'essentiel (ce qui se trouve dans les assiettes) reste très bon.
La majorité de plat sont assez épicé donc attention au personne qui n'aime pas sa !!!!!

pour ce restaurant j'ai juste un point négatif à mettre en avant c'est l'ambiance générale, la musique qui passe qui reste pas en accord avec les origines du restaurant. C'est dommage parce que sinon j'aurai mis 5 à la note !!!!"}
{"text":"Montreal's Caribbean community seems to know about this place, but few others do. Located at the end of the commercial strip on Victoria in Plamondon, it's easy to miss, which is a shame.

I've been to La Maison de Cari a few times, and each time had a fantastic, reasonably priced meal. The roti are fresh, and stuffed with excellent, flavourful stews. Dinners include the range of Caribbean dishes: oxtail, goat, red snapper, etc. And I love the fresh sorrel drink.

Is this the best roti in Montreal? I haven't tried many of the rest, but I wouldn't be surprised if it is."}
{"text":"Excellent roti. So far, we just tried take out but the dining room looked comfortable. I will be back."}
{"text":"My Go to spot for Rotis and Patties!  The prices are decent , they also have daily lunch specials for less than 10 bucks!

Located on Victoria  near Jean talon. Easily accessible by metro ( plamondon) or car. The restaurant is not fancy at all, but you will get a good vibe! Island music in the background, somewhat friendly staff depending on how their day is going. I always had good service. You can either pick up your food and enjoy at home or eat there. I personally pick it up.

I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the cote des neiges area!"}
{"text":"2 words: GOAT ROTI

This place has amazing goat roti..not to mention all their other authentic carribean dishes. I have been here over 10 X and i have never had a complaint. The food is fresh, flavorful and reasonably priced...you cant go wrong. 

Will i be going back? Yes, 100%"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me there a few weeks back and I love it. Doesn't look like nothing at first because the place is so small (maybe sit 20) but once you walk in you fall in love with the ambiance. Great Caribbean music, all the smells come together and the staff is smiling and very friendly. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is that the service is a little slow and you have to stand in line to get your order taken.
Everything on the menu is no more than 15$ and you get very good portion. Perfect use of spices not too much but just enough that you can get your spice fix. My boyfriend and his brother had a Rotti that I tried and wasn't crazy about but the jerk chicken was to die for.
So since that first time my boyfriend took me there we have been back many time and its always good. This is one of the best place in Montreal to get Caribbean food."}
{"text":"The Caribbean land mark has been around for over 30 years and has maintained one thing Quality .. every plate is done with the same passion as a  Jamaican mom cooking in the kitchen all day with no help. the total disregard to basic standards goes to show that these people know how to cook and serve great food .. from the Ox tail to the Roti's will blow you away .. with Caribbean music playing in the background you can't help to order a rum punch a relax to the chill vibe."}
{"text":"Most authentic and insanely delicious curry I have ever had. The kingfish was just incredible but the one with goat is the best. The goat roti is amazing and the oxtail is the best I've had. Also I liked the stewed chicken as well, it melted in my mouth. Rice with beans were ok. It's priced amazingly for the taste you're gonna get."}
{"text":"I went to eat food at this restaurant and I forgot that no one takes my American debit card. That is after I ordered the food. The restaurant was nice and was like go to an ATM in the Subway. So I went to the Subway and when I came back they still had my food waiting for me. That was good because when I ate the food it was really good. I like the ground beef. This is one of my top ten restaurants in Montreal: Thanjai, Caribbean Curry House, and Poutine!"}
{"text":"Ox tail plate is good. Goat curry need to be more tender. Price are reasonable for the portion."}
{"text":"This has been my go-to for Caribbean for 10 years.

Great decor and the staff are straight and to the point. 

Daily specials."}
{"text":"Location: Victoria, below Jean-Talon. If you're using transit, Plamondon is the closest subway (less than 10 minutes away if you're walking). If you plan to use street parking, be sure to check the signage. 

The place: I can't comment on the location or service because a group of us called in our order for pick-up. The process is pretty smooth - just call them to place your order to make sure it's ready for pick-up at the time you plan to go. 

The goods: I should start by saying that I'm not an expert on Caribbean cuisine. In fact, the extent of my knowledge starts and ends with Jamaican patties. However, I do think I have a decent, though be it, selective palate. I'm a big fan of the Roti - I ordered the shrimp and wasn't disappointed at all. The ratio of shrimp to chickpea/potato/veg was pretty good, and the size of the Roti was definitely big enough for one person. The flavors were subtle, yet delicious - for those of you worried about spice, this isn't spicy at all. Based on my buddy's feedback (he's a regular), these guys will make it as spicy as you want, but you have to ask for it. He also says it's the best place in town to get Roti and so far, I can't disagree. Great place to grab lunch.

Service: N/A

Price point: The shrimp Roti was $8.95. I feel like that's a bit steep, but like I said, the portion is pretty good. Check it out and let you judge for yourselves."}
{"text":"Small and cozy with nice reggae music.  You order at the cash and go sit and they will call you when your meal is ready.  It comes on a platter so it's a bit like in a cafeteria.  The jerk chicken is very spicy (like it should be!) and the rotis has a generous of meat (I personally tried the goat and chicken one).   They have a fair variety of beer and liquor as well that you can order with your food. The cashier was mellow and friendly. Will surely return and try new items."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I went with the intention that I was getting Jamaican food. I was so excited to be getting Jamaican food while in MONTREAL. However the key word in the title is Caribbean. I went with my mom to get take out to bring back to our hotel and we ordered Curry goat and curry shrimp, both with rice and peas.  It was very salty and the rice grains were a bit hard. The meat also didn't taste like Goat... it was more like Lamb (mutton) The workers in there also weren't very welcoming, which also made the experience negative. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"I used to eat here off and on all the time until about 6 years ago when I moved out of town. When I came back, I had read some mediocre reviews so I had neglected to go back until this past weekend. I had the shrimp plate, which should be called the shrimp and chickpea plate. It was well-spiced and I really enjoyed the curry mixed with the rice and peas. The salad was basic, and the fried plantains (which are one of my favorite things ever) a little dry. I feel as if they make one batch and serve them all day. They have a number of fun drinks, so I had a coconut pineapple soda which reminded me a little bit of cream soda with a tropical twist - really nice.I also tried a bite of my sister's chicken roti, and that had a different combination of spices that was really tasty as well. 
I came back today to have one of the beef patties, and it was the best patty I have ever had! No lie. It was moist and had the perfect level of heat. The price point is perfect too, so I feel like I will be stopping in here more regularly in future."}
{"text":"My wife had a nostalgic 'three winks' kind of moment driving around her long standing neighbourhood. She bethought of this carribean joint which sold, instancing, roti and patties. She used to fancy them as a child. I had the beef patty. The shell sure was flaky and of golden hue. The filling gave me a cue of an aromatic blend of  curry spices. A suited and clean bite that leaves no maculated hands."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of west Indian food so naturally I go to Caribbean Curry House . This was not a good visit, the curry was fresh \" meaning it smelled amazing but had no flavor\" the passion fruit was amazing. So after the fresh curry I went back to ask for two roti skins and I was told that they had a rush now and couldn't afford to sell me two skins because they have customers that might want the same skins that I stood in line for.

My opinion is that you can find way better West Indian places than this place I will never give them my money or time ever again."}
{"text":"Excellent and I do mean Excellent food. I live in Jamaica, Queens,  NY...so I have had my share of good Caribbean food. I had the roti and it was definitely the best roti I have ever had. My husband had the oxtail and rice which he said was really good. The service is very good as well, the man who I believe is the owner is a very kind man. Someone mentioned crime? I am not sure but we hung out in the neigborhood for a while before actually going to the restaurant and I felt completely safe, I am from Queens, NY though and it takes a lot to get me shook LOL. Wanted to buy some to take home but we just didnt have enough time. Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Best jerk chicken in Montreal! If your looking for good food in Montreal make sure to come here"}
{"text":"I can't believe that I have never been here until now. Everything was exceptionally tasty and the service was quick and friendly. The only thing I would have liked to see was the bones in the oxtail. I find it gives a nice flavor. Other than that I was excellent. The mutton roti is a must."}
{"text":"Well, I was looking forward to this experience based on other reviews, but I wasn't impressed. I ordered a chickpea potato roti, which was bland and filled with canned chickpeas. If I had to make a guess, I would bet that the chickpeas came out of a huge Costco can and had been sitting around in a plastic container for a while. The oxtail stew was mostly fat and bones. Oh yeah - and I had to wait around 20 minutes for a takeout order. Meh."}
{"text":"I went here a couple years ago. The rotis were fine. But what really made this visit a memorable one is that two women started a fistfight while waiting in line. Believe me, you never forget that day. Lol."}
{"text":"Home away from home. This place offers you the tastes of the west Indies while paying a decent amount. I highly recommend the jerk chicken and goat roti. Both are mouthwatering and takes me back to how my grandmother cooked. 

The service has improved over the years. I know the place had its issues with a rude staff but they're now more family oriented now and look to please. Even the Jamaican patties are unique and makes a nice light snack. Don't  forget to try the ginger beer, it will go down well with the plate."}
{"text":"The roti is are amazing ,you got to have the sorrel too, taste just similar to the ones you get at family celebrations at Christmas.Service a little lacklustre but the roti is good,Skins made in house too"}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was a child. I would say it was better ten years ago compared to today in terms of food taste and quality but even then, it competes with the best Caribbean foods you can find in Montreal. Place is pretty small but you can always take it to go."}
{"text":"In town for a few days and One of the many things I love about Canada is its diversity of people which leads to diversity of food. It's been a long time since I had a good roti so that's where my search began. After browsing around I came across this place which had pretty good reviews over all. The location itself isn't that large but it was perfectly personified the family run setup.  

Once waking in you'll notice the menu is on the wall opposite the counter you place your order at. I glanced over the menu already knowing what I planned to order and was quite surprised by the nice selection of food.  Even the Roti selection has many choices . This time I got 1 chicken roti and 1 goat roti. Both of them were excellent but I must say I enjoyed the chicken roti the most. Add a little peppa sauce which is displayed on the table and you have yourself a fantastic snack and/or meal. I defended will give this place another visit when I am back in Montreal."}
{"text":"We took the Metro from downtown based on a recommendation by a local and I am so glad we did. One of us had the Red Snapper which filled the plate and the other had the Shrimp curry which was prepared Trini-style, different that I am used to, since I have only had the Jamaican style.  This one has carrots, medium-sized shrimp, plenty of rice, and plantain (sp??). I wish there had been more plantain. The portion was enought for two to share, especially if you are going back to a hotel room like I did and unable to take leftovers.  There was a live DJ on the Friday when we ate there.  Oh, and the price was only about $8 and $10 a piece."}
{"text":"Ce restaurant ne gagnera certainement pas un prix en ce qui concerne son décor ou son service, mais côté bouffe, c'est très bon! 

Je commande toujours leurs fameux rotis jamaïcain. Mon favori? Celui à la chèvre. C'est pas cher du tout et ça rempli bien - une belle option pour le lunch.

Bonus: moi (et mon corps qui se dandine présentement) apprécions beaucoup la musique des îles qui joue dans le resto."}
{"text":"Best chicken roti and patty ever. Food taste amazing. Try their hot sauce. They do accept debit cards"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong getting any kind of roti here. The patties were also phenomenal. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. Highly recommend, I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly and really good food. I came here for the first time a little over two years ago and I've been hooked ever since, the only draw back about coming here is the parking is not very easy to find, especially at lunch time."}
{"text":"Great Caribbean food, certainly the best I've had in Montreal.

Tried the Oxtail, knife barely necessary!  Great flavors, Jerk Wings were flavorful and falling apart, but a bit soggy.

Most definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Hands down our favourite Caribbean joint in the city. The restaurant is small but cozy, with a great selection of Caribbean dishes. From lamb to oxtail to goat to jerk chicken, this place has it all. Many people come just for takeout and we do too. Their daily soups are amazing and the rotis are what bring me back time after time. The flavours really pack a punch and always leave you wanting for more. :)"}
{"text":"Good experience. The Goat Roti was yummy, drinks good and service is self serve. Prices are cheap, plus you can eat there or take out. Lady behind the counter seemed passionate about her food. I will come here time to time."}
{"text":"A good restaurant located in one of the worst neighborhoods in Montreal.  It's truly a shame where this place is located.  I know A LOT of people, myself included, who stopped going there not because of the food, but because of the crime in the area.  Broad daylight or dead of night, the local gangs don't seem to care.  They will jack you up, and beat you down if you resist.  

But to the resturant itself, the food is great.  It's an icon of the community.  My only complaint is the dough in their doubles is too moist and gooey.  It's never properly cooked.  Their salad is also bland.  It's just cut lettuce with some tasteless orange dressing.

But don't let those two things change your mind.  The overall food experience is really good.  It's not the best quality but it certainly has flavor, especially their king fish plate.   But a WARNING on if you get their chicken roti.  There is often a lot of bones in it (which is why I am giving a 2 star.. a signature Caribbean dish they managed to mess up so badly because someone is too lazy to take the bones out of the chicken?).  The prices are decent for what you get though.

So if you unfortunately find yourself in that part of town, be sure to leave your ipod and wallet at home, and head on over to the Curry House."}
{"text":"I love both the chicken and the beef roti but don't forget about the doubles. So good"}
{"text":"Amazing rotis! Highly recommended :) The meat is tender and every component blends in perfectly. Best place to go to if you're feeling nostalgic about the Carribeans."}
{"text":"Have you ever had an orgasm in your mouth?

Well, that's exactly what happened to me when I tried their Jerk Chicken, flavors exploding everywhere. Spice, zest, heat, tang, all at the same time!

The litmus test for Caribbean food has always been how well they do their Jerk Chicken, Oxtail Stew, Ackee (fish) and fried plantains. I have not tried all these items but based on my experience with the Jerk Chicken and Chicken Roti (voted the best in Montreal) that will soon not be the case.
If you can't stand spice or heat, or like your food bland, then don't come here, go to Burger King instead. Vegetarians  also have options here as they are items like Vegetable Roti on their menu.
All items on the menu are $12 or less, this place is a bit small, maybe seats 20 people max, and there is a take-out counter. 
Not high end dining by any stretch of the imagination but if you need a spice fix done right, then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"What surprised me the most is that they prepare their rotis beforehand and only heat them up in the microwave (i think) for a couple seconds before serving...real turn off for me.

Food: 
Goat roti was the best (4/5) but chicken roti (2.5/5) wasnt as tasty as you'd expect and I didnt find it to work well with the spices in the curry (it's the same curry for every roti). The beef patties have a good flaky pastry that is a bit crispy on the outside and not dried out on the inside, but I found the beef filling to be really average: had good flavors but no meat flavor, so it sucked, but at 1.35$ -ish, I didnt complain.

Service:
The indians, whom I suspect to be the owners, looked unhappy ad unwelcoming both times I visited. They were rude to their staff, and impatient with me."}
{"text":"We found this place by luck. We drove down Victoria looking for anything interesting and fist corner we saw was here.
I had the mutton Roti which was excellent, while the wife had fish and my son chicken with rice. All was excellent.
We ordered jerk wings which were pretty interesting but way to much salt. Actually brought my blood pressure up!!! Would have given 5 stars if that was done right.
Service was good and very well priced!! Although area did not look the greatest. 
I will go back to get my Caribbean fix in the near future!!"}
