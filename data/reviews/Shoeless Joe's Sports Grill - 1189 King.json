{"text":"When we don't know what we want to eat- we come here! Great prices, yummy consistent food. Lots of choices on the menu. Service is good."}
{"text":"I will just say this Food Poisoning!!!
Went their for a hockey game last night and now i'm paying the price 
The food was crap so i'm not surprised now, never going back again.
The only reason I could see people going their to eat are the servers, 
which aren't very bright at all. Over 10 minutes to get a pint of beer, and it wasn't
even busy. Ordered the wings which were big but only cause the bone inside was big, and also had the fajitas wrap  which also was crap, had no chicken just cheese inside. Very disappointing, the only good thing was the leafs lost ....
 Stay Away!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Went there this evening for my birthday and they completely forgot my meal! They tried to cover it up by rushing it, so I ended up with nachos that were completely cold and unmelted in the middle on a scorching hot plate. On top of that they burned my sister's fish, and then argued with me when I requested that both be removed from the bill. They offered to remake both, but at that point everyone else was done eating. Then, as a final disappointment, the manager came over. But not to apologize, to defend the burnt fish saying that the pan gets hot and sometimes it just comes out that way. Isn't it a cook's job to know how not to burn the oil?! Will never go back."}
{"text":"Great bar to watch soccer especially when Toronto FC is playing, bar is sortof headquarters of a big supporter group of the club. Also great atmosphere for UFC events and hockey. Big UFC events or the ones where GSP is fighting really make the place go crazy"}
{"text":"I only ever go here to watch PPV sports, but it's an awesome place for it--the food is cheap, greasy, and plentiful, and despite the crowd, the service is prompt and attentive.  Besides, watching the fights isn't fun unless everyone's into it.  

Go early to get a seat, though--there's always a couple of moochers who show up at seven, occupy a ten-seat table, and drink colas all night until their buddies show up just in time for the main event."}
{"text":"Great spot in Liberty village.  Atmosphere is amazing during big sporting events like Raptors/Jays playoff games and UFC fights.  Lots of TVs (including patio) so anywhere you sit is a good view.

Menu is pretty standard for sports bar but made really well.  Stater apps and pizza selection are solid to choose from.  There's usually a good drink promotion like mini pitchers."}
{"text":"I just want to start by saying that this review is NOT based on the food, my husband had pasta and I had a flat bread pizza, I'd probably give 4 stars if it was based on what we ate however, we had the single most ridiculous restaurant experience ever here last week.   I'm copying the e-mail we sent to Shoeless Joe's (and never heard back from) in an attempt to summarize this ridiculous experience. It's unfortunate because this has been a go to for us since moving to the area and I've also spent many an afternoon drinking here before TFC games, unless we hear back from them we don't ever intend to return to this place.

When we arrived just before 7pm we were shown to our table and greeted by our waitress who seemed to be (and I believe she was) completely sober.  The restaurant was not busy at this time, and she got our drinks and left us with more time with the menu.

After approximately 20 minutes, she returned and seemed confused.  She greeted us like we hadn't been there yet, and we had to prompt her to take our order.  She came back with drink refills that she had incredible difficulty putting on the table without spilling.  When she returned with our food, she was wobbly and barely avoided dropping both dishes.  

When we asked for the bill, she had to lean on the table to steady herself and she smelled VERY strongly of alcohol on her breath.  She returned with the bill and a beer (that we didn't order) that she was continually spilling and could not form a sentence.  She eventually communicated that the bill was too covered in beer to give to us and stumbled off.

During all this time, the restaurant filled up and the other 2 servers had to cover for her.  I ended up calling the restaurant as I left and spoke to the server in charge , who was aware that she was drunk and had just spoken to her and told her she had to go home."}
{"text":"I have to disagree with Sam. If you are looking for a bar then this is a great choice. It's on a quiet part of King West where there is a ton of street parking right out front and the screens couldn't get much better. You can get a good view of the game from any seat in the house. 

In terms of the food, it's bar food. Having said that, it's better than most comparable places. Serving sizes are large and there's a ton of variety. All THREE types of fries (shoestring, lattice and sweet potato) are AMAZING. I LOVE fries, so take it from me - they are gooooood.  

Service is excellent here as well and the atmosphere is warm and inviting and during a big hockey night, it's also fun.

One thing I have to criticize are the nachos. I don't think I would even really call them mediocre and I definitely believe that every good bar needs a good nacho platter - so that's one thing they need to work on. Otherwise, I like it here. It's a cozy neighbourhood sports bar with pretty good food, service and environment - a solid 3 stars!"}
{"text":"Went here before MLS Cup 2010 at BMO. First off, the nachos are not big enough to feed 4 people and a small child. Second, the food is small for the price no matter what you order. The place was packed with TFC and FC Dallas supporters and our waitress did a good job on coming back to us. I'd go back again, if I'm in TO and I'm headed to BMO."}
{"text":"went here for late dinner & drink with a friend a couple of weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised at the new decor ... not such a dive anymore with new booths, lots more seating and updated washrooms
however my friend is pregnant and we asked the waitress about virgin drinks to which we were told they don't do that, or they can but the price is the same (ridiculous) ... so I asked about a kid menu with different drinks and we were told they don't do that either - waitress was rude and abrupt like we were wasting her time.  However a few minutes later I found a non-alcoholic drink menu and when we asked the waitress about the 'virgin drinks' that was clearly printed on the menu for half the price she said 'oh yea ... some drinks we can do but not all' so we asked specifically what drinks and she still didn't know and so we then had to ask her to go find out.  Fortunately the food was quick and good (good enough for bar food) but we could've done without the waitress attitude
The bar is nice (atmosphere, decor, food etc) and we will probably go back because of the location but will definitely request a different waitress"}
{"text":"Service is good but cant tell the same thing for the chicken quesadilla. This place is one of your options for pre-game TFC matches."}
{"text":"I had been to this location several times before the renovation and was disappointed every time. Just went for the first time since the renos and was actually surprised at how much it's been cleaned up. The space is much more open and comfortable. Tv's at every booth are a nice touch for sports fans. The menu has expanded considerably and improved tenfold. Choices are great for a night of watching the game with friends and best of all - mini pitchers of beer for under 10$! Good upgrade for the block."}
{"text":"Defo my favorite place to be before TFC games, also great for watching UFC and for generally watching any sport. They can control each TV individually which is AMAZING. 

They have pretty decent prices on beer and $5.50 tall boys of Stella before TFC games. 

The place is clean, ribs are fantastic. I wish they didn't take Jambalaya off the menu :(

Burger is surprisingly good, not hotel good, but very good. Nachos are a bit disappointing and it would be nice if they gave you a few more layers of chips for the money. 

I haven't had their steak or salmon or anything like that, I don't think it is that kind of place."}
{"text":"Seriously... if you're going there just because you can't afford a TV at home, you are at the right place. Otherwise, there's so many sport bars out there where you can actually have real ambiance and real food!

Even if we were hungry, hubby and I contented ourselves with 2 Coronas just because we didn't want to miss a second of the game. We ended up running to another bar after the 1st period to be able to have decent sport food with our sport beer watching our favourite sport.

Also, while most sport bars were crowded around, this one was empty - understandably so - and there was hockey, baseball and basketball playing at the same time on their hundreds of giant screens... needless to comment on the type of atmosphere in the place : dead."}
{"text":"My buddies and I ate here last night. We are from Atlanta and are one  a business trip. We spent over $200 at the restaurant and then the waitress loses my friends credit card. She just did not bring it back, we addressed it while she was still standing there. She fiddled around for a minute, looked around and could not find it. The manager on duty would do nothing to help. The owner called today to say they still could not find it and that he would do nothing to compensate us for the inconvenience. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"It's shoeless joes ..... Don't expect much. They had good service, good drinks and OK food. The server who waited on the table was helpful in ordering and checked on the table often. Good for a pre-drink or watching sports games."}
{"text":"Well I've always loved this place. It never fails to amaze me. Last time I had a burger and omg was it ever good. The wings are
To die for. They have some of the best sandwiches."}
{"text":"Yeah, it pains me to do this, as this is a local bar, but my boyfriend and I just left after waiting fifteen minutes for a server. We were seated by the bartender and she appeared a little upset to watch us leave. In the time that we spent there, we saw one waitress who hurried into the back, never to emerge again. I've been living here in the area for five years, and had been coming here regularly, but last summer things really went downhill. 

Upon arriving to sit on the patio last summer we were shocked by the new menu. Prices had shot up by at least 40% per item. $17+ dollars for a burger? $16+ for less than a pound of wings with a side of fries? And forget about ordering an actual entree (steak, ribs, or chicken), as the quality of the food is so poor, it's hardly edible. 

It's clear that during the week they are appealing to the drinking crowd, and their drink specials are often the only thing worth going for, but on the weekend it's so packed you don't often see your server for over a half-hour. 

So, it pains me to say this, but we won't be returning, and neither should you. It's massively overpriced, the service sucks, and the only thing on their menu that is any good are the wings, but at the current price point I wouldn't buy them either. 

So long, Shoeless Joes. With your current formula of business, you must be hemmoraging money like crazy."}
{"text":"I have never had such poor service at a restaurant like this! My boyfriend and I came to sit outside on the patio for a few drinks after a long day at work.

We were greeted and seated quick enough. We weren't provided any drink menus and waited for our server. About 15 minutes after being seated, a waitress finally came outside and served the table sitting next to us. She then walked directly passed us, made eye contact and went back inside without saying a word to us!

We had made it pretty clear that we hadn't been served yet and some acknowledgement would have been nice.
My boyfriend and I were insulted so we left and received far better service at Harry's. 

I won't be spending my hard earned money at a restaurant that provides atrocious service! Bye Felicia."}
{"text":"I've never seen such clueless people own and operate a restaurant. Waitstaff are treated like slaves, and the owners have a bed in the back office where they lay and watch the surveillance cameras. Super creepy and gross.

The chicken wings are good though."}
{"text":"Went here to watch a UFC card and since it's a sports bar there were a lot of TVs which is great so you're able to see a TV comfortably from anywhere you sit. 

Price is a little high for drinks. A pint of Keith's cost over $7. The location is in a higher priced area so I'm not surprised but for those prices I would have liked a better local craft beer. 

Ordered a desert and it was pretty good but I imagine deserts are probably coming frozen anyways so it's not much to screw up. 

For being a large sports bar and having what I imagine is a pretty male skewing demographic the men's room is criminally small. Two urinals and two stalls. 

Service was ok but not great. Took a while to get drinks but the place as packed so not very surprising. Some more staff would be helpful on busy nights. 

Overall, I would find somewhere better to go in the area but if it's the only option you could do a lot worse."}
{"text":"Terrible. Smelled liked a locker room (guess it's fitting?). For some reason they had the heat cranked. And whatever they pass off as food is despicable. 

Our waitress was horrible, took 14 minutes to bring us a second round of drinks and then came back and explained that the printer wasn't working. Last time I checked you didn't need a printer to pour a pint of beer. 

The place is sticky and gross, nearly went through a whole bottle of hand sanitizer in my hour long visit. 

Don't get me wrong, this place is amazing if you're on the hunt for bad waitresses with big boobs and daddy issues. And if sub-par food is your thing, this is YOUR PLACE! 

Take my advice and skip this place!"}
{"text":"went there after rock climbing in Joe Rockhead's. Location is perfect to go to after a work out in Joe's. 
the atmosphere is very sporty. Feels like all the guests are sports' fans and one of the games just finished and ppl came to celebrate and discuss the winning of their fave team!=) 
lots of TV screens around showing all kids of sports also adds to that feeling. 
in general very positive atmosphere and cheerful staff adds to that. 
the menu has lots of meal varieties and special deals for mon-thur. Monday was 30oz beer for $5.99. 
Not that many options for vegetairans but still lots of veggie appetiziers and few sandwiches. 
Would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"This is a great place to watch any sports games. There's quite an enthusiastic crowd for TFC soccer. There's also a pool table in the far end of the restaurant. 
Suitable for dates, large groups or families.
The restaurant is clean, and the service is friendly and fast.
The menu is pretty typical bar food, burgers, salads, wraps and flatbreads. 
Servings are pretty big. My boyfriend ordered some kind of crispy chicken burger with fries on the side which he enjoyed. the chicken was a chicken breast fried in a crispy batter. I had a classic salad which was good (the only vegan option available). Go here to watch sports and the beer and the crowd, not necessarily for the food."}
{"text":"My friend was in from out of town, so I had picked out Caffino for our dinner.  Apparently I should have called ahead before we were there and starving because the restaurant was reserved for a wedding.  I'm not overly familiar with the area, but I didn't think there were many options so we settled on Shoeless Joe's next door.  Definitely not either of our preference, but we were hungry.  I try to avoid chains whenever possible, I spent enough time on them when I lived in cities without other options.

It was after 7 on a Saturday and the place was empty.  We seated ourselves on the patio as instructed, and the waitress came by with menus and tried to sell us on beer before she disappeared inside.  We had plenty of time to make our selections before she came out - my friend had the bacon and cheddar grilled chicken sandwich, and I chose the chili and cheddar burger.  The food didn't take too long to come out luckily, although when it did I was left staring at my burger.  Okay, fine, it's a chili burger, I guess I could have assumed it would be a little messy.  I think I had ignored the chili part of the description and just focused on the jalapenos and cheddar.  But this was ridiculous.  Even if I were to try and pick it up, before I would even get my hands around it they would be covered in chili.  It was dripping down all sides of the burger!  I went inside and snagged a knife and fork, and that made it edible.  It was okay.  I got the feeling my friend felt the same.  The fries were very good though, although her request for extra crispy seemed to have been ignored.  

The service was really not very good though, and with so few full tables there was no excuse.  We waited a long time before she came out and we could ask for our bill.  We wanted to get going, so we had our money ready for when she came out with it.  For some reason, it took her a good 5-10 minutes to bring our bills - there was one order per person, we didn't even get drinks, so I don't know why splitting the bill would be complicated.  And again, it was nearly an empty restaurant with at least three servers.  When she did finally return, she put the bills on the table and disappeared again before we could give her our money.  At this point we were getting annoyed, so we went inside to find her ourselves so we could finally get out of there.  

All in all, it's a chain restaurant, with \"meh\" food and not-so-great service.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Good food and service! Highly recommend the all star appetizers coz it has a bit of everything. The people working here are always very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant no stars if I could. I ordered the turkey burger which was recommended by the server to be great. It was burnt. I'm not even sure why it was served to me in the first place. I sent it back and only ended up eating the side salad that came with it. The server gave me nothing but attitude so i asked for the bill. The burger was still on there even though I didn't eat it. The server said I ate the salad so that why it wasn't removed... I asked to speak to the manager. After several minutes the server returned to the table threw down the receipt and walked away. She didn't return. All that was on the bill was my drink. So I paid for it and left. I will not go back there. The server gave TERRIBLE customer service, my meal was inedible and management didn't even bother to try and rectify the issue."}
{"text":"I've only ever been here for drinks. It's a grungy looking sports bar, but it is always packed on the patio in the summer.

Service is ok, I've experienced WAY better elsewhere. Haven't tried the food so can't comment. The beer available is so-so, not a big selection. If you have no where else to go and are looking to wet your whistle, then stop here. If you can wait till the next bar, I suggest doing that. It's nothing to write home about, unfortunately."}
{"text":"My friend Andy performs at Medieval Times.  He is one of the knights.  We used to be roomates years ago and we always went to Shoeless Joes for a drink and to play some pool.

They have great food, excellent service and a place to eat inside and outside.

Good as a sports bar with tasty food, meet the stars of Medieval Times (they hang out there ALL the time)"}
{"text":"Surprised to see the bad reviews because I've been there twice now and have had great experience! Granted I was there for fight night and basketball (less crowded) but each time it's been great food and service. The New York sirloin dish there is better than the keg downtown in my opinion. Most of all, drinks are cheap here (gin and tonic was around $5-6 which is by far the cheapest for a sports bar in this area). Mini pitchers were $10. Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Didn't even know there was a Shoeless Joes here but it's conveniently located as I have ball hockey nearby as well it's close to the Liberty Goodlife. 

There's lots of TVs all over so whichever angle you sit at you'll be in clear view of a TV, so great for sporting events.

Not sure if our ball hockey league had a special deal but we got free nachos with 2 pitchers of beer. 

On the down side it took quite a while for our orders to come and 2/9 orders were incorrect. The waitress did try to make things up with free cheesecake but in the future I will repeat my order twice just to be sure."}

{"text":"All the waitresses wear low cut tops and the food is pretty good.  There's an Asian guy in a baseball cap that runs the show.  I don't get it, where's HIS low cut top? It's weird because this is a sports bar, but it's not Hooters so why is every waitress so well endowed?!  The chicken tenders and sweet potato fries are out of this world and I didn't notice any weird smells like other reviews have said.   Even though I liked this place, I really thought it was strange that the women were kinda pimped out, cleavage-wise by this manager. As a woman, I must say, UP URS to the management."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Shoeless on-and-off again for several years, and for my money, I'm watching it in a slow decline. 

The servers have always been friendly, relaxed, professional, and fun to be around, but the food is another story.  Over the years, portions have been reduced by a large margin for the price, and that's a major disappointment.  

Not stellar, but their wings have always been good if a little on the pricier side when compared to other pubs.  Their burgers are fine.  But most recently, my \"stacked\" Montreal smoked meat lunch with quinoa left a great deal to be desired.

\"Stacked,\" huh? Ok. For $11, I certainly wasn't expecting a razor-thin sandwich, served on a pretentious rectangular plate, that had so little of the promised Keen's Mustard that I had to peel back the (also small slice of) bread to see if any made it there at all.  I was reduced to using the French's brand the bar keeps handy.  And no one should be left still hungry after finishing a meal. 

My server was apologetic, agreeing with me, and told me how every serving is meticulously measured.  My Montreal smoked meat, for example, was never intended to weigh more than 2 ounces.  Hardly a \"stack.\"  

Over the years, it's become clear to me that this resto has been gradually cutting corners for a long time.  I may come back for beers and occasionally for the (overpriced) wings.  If I'm in the area.  And if no other, better option is presenting itself for me.  And if I feel like being really, really, really tolerant."}
{"text":"Since last year, I have been to this location approximately 6 more times and have LOVED every single time. My new found glory - their nachos! Something about the cheese and bean sauce they add too it that is just so good. Their wings aren't terrible either but I have had better at other pubs. Either way - their nachos has kept me coming back 6 times this year. I have come on busy days (El Classico x2) and on non-busy days. Service has been good all 6x I have gone. 

Big shout out to Christina? Who was our server today and was just the nicest server I have encountered in a very long time. Her tip reflected it :)

Hope to be back in the next month or so again!"}
{"text":"Ended up here with some friends to watch the Mavs-Heat NBA game, and we were greeted by really friendly servers and a pretty warm, fun vibe at the restaurant.  We got some good seats, were informed about the Thursday $4 drink special, and proceeded to order.  I had the smoked jalapeno with honey glaze chicken wings, which weren't bad, and a couple slices of my friend's meat lover pizza (pretty tasty).  Just based on the energy and hospitality of the place (not to mention the drink special), I would recommend it."}
{"text":"The key to this place is the number of TV's and selection of sports.  They show all the fights, from UFC to Boxing events to Soccer.  Don't come here for the food, come here if you want a place that isn't mega packed and you want a seat for a sporting event.

The food is your typical bar grub, nothing special. The service I experienced was quick and friendly.

Next time I am in the area and watch boxing or UFC, I will consider it."}
{"text":"I work in the neighbourhood and Shoeless Joe's has become a regular after work hang out for grabbing food and drinks. I even go there for my lunch break sometimes. 

The food is alright, typical for a sports bar. I really like their blackened chicken salad though. The service varies; there have been good nights and bad. Overall, it's a decent place to hang if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This Shoeless Joe's has to be one of the worst bars for service in the city. Last time I was there was during the World Cup and even though the place was barely busy we still had to wait 30+ minutes each time for our server to come around. The food arrived about 45 minutes after we ordered and as expected was cold. Nothing worse than cold fries but at that point we were so hungry we ate it anyway. When it came time for the bills we again waited about 30 minutes for the server to bring our bills. When she finally did she told us their debit/credit system was down and we would have to wait. She wouldn't even let people leave to use the bank. Eventually I had to pay my friends bill as they needed to catch a flight and couldn't wait for the bar to figure things out which still took forever.

I'd love to say this was the first time there, but it was not. It seems every time I've been here something goes wrong and the only reason I end up back here is because I'll have some friends who are already there.

Their TV setup is excellent but with a crappy beer selection and some of the worst service in the city I'd rather watch the game on a 20\" TV elsewhere or at home. Save your money."}
{"text":"Went here with my football team after a game. Had great service by our server Owen. It can be hard serving large parties but dude had swag. Gave us free chips and dip because he knew we would  be drinkin mass pitchers. Turned the music up, jammed with us a bit, split the bill of 17  pitchers no problem. Good service is hard to come by esp with large parties. Props to Owen."}
{"text":"I was there during their grand opening, and thought it was pretty amazing. I had their Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and it was huge and delicious. I ordered it the next two times I was there, and every time it was completely different... and each time the quality got worse. Two of the times I was there was for farewell work lunches, and our group was big! Maybe around 15 of us or more. It is hard to handle big groups, but our lunches were 2.5 hours long. And we worked about 1-2 minute walk away. They should have treated us as 2-3 tables...

The pluses are the wait staff is usually quite attractive. When they had their grand opening they definitely brought out their big guns... it also contains a lot of TVs for watching sports, if you are into that. The place is just a cut above Hooters. It's on my list of places I refuse to go to."}
{"text":"The service was nice but the menu was outdated and my burger was overcooked. Even the Sangrias weren't as tasty as other locations."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at Shoeless Joe's before heading to the Bruno Mars concert (it was on the way to the venue).

This restaurant is in our 'hood but we rarely go there.  We like the food but we're not fans of the restaurant itself ... it's not a cozy fun spot.

There were people on the patio.  We sat inside where it was cooler.


Gord and I both wings.  Gord has his wings dusted with cajun spice along with onion rings.  I had my wings traditional with Joe's Buffalo Butter sauce and fries.  Though the food was good, we both thought the meals were rather skimpy given the price (seven wings to a pound).

Angie was our server and she took good care of us (it was her first day)."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to watch the champions league final, me and my girlfriend ended up here, we got there 20 min before the kickoff and it was almost full, so we got lucky that we could got a table. As it was a special event, the bar was crowded and the service was very slow. We had to ask for the Menu and when we were ready to order we had to jump over a waitress to make the order. In the end we just ordered a beer pitcher, by the time we wanted to order something to snack, the bar was crowded and we became invisible for the waitresses.

Service 2.5/5: they were friendly but also very slow.

Atmosphere 4.5/5: It is a great place to watch sport events.

Food - drinks N/A: We just got a beer pitcher, there's not too much beers variety.

Pricing 3/5: Average."}
{"text":"Clueless staff!!

My coworker who is a regular here ordered the chicken fajita wrap but instead was brought some chicken appetizer. He pointed this out to the server when the server brought the wrong dish and the server replied 'no, you did order this'...um OK awkward.  It was then brought to the attention of another server and the owner that the wrong dish was served to my coworker and again just awkward conversation and NO offer to correct the mistake and offer him the dish he did want.

In the end my coworker did not eat the dish (as it isn't what he wanted at all) and paid for it. I can't believe the staff are so clueless. I doubt he'll be returning."}
{"text":"This place gets 3 stars just for being one of the only places in the entire city that actually plays HBO Boxing PPVs. No cover. Arrive early or book a table. Lots of tvs and 2 large screens.

Food is average bar food. Some okay drink specials. Service has been okay the 3-4 times I have been here.

Nothing outstanding, just your regular sports bar."}
{"text":"Last night, we took Shoeless Joe's up on their deal where we got 10% of the value of the meals that we had eaten there.  It turns out that we only got 10% of the value of the FOOD that we had purchased in the past, not the alcohol... which makes sense... I'm just not sure that was the way it was presented to us when they told us about it in the first place (i.e. it could have been just 10% of the receipts).

ANYWAYS, had the beef club sandwich... mediocre... One thing was that the club sandwich was only cut into halves... I thought to be a club it had to be cut in four?  Doesn't matter, just curious.

I need to stop ordering food there... the food's not terrible, but the prices are high and for a couple bucks more you could get something much better somewhere else.

Still a 3, if you generally restrict yourself to the specials.  Otherwise, 2."}
