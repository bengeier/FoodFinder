{"text":"This sushi restaurant at the corner of Queen and Caroline is a take-out superstar. You can walk in to place your order or call ahead for pick up or delivery; they add a reasonable $3.00 delivery charge for the area nearby and $5.00 + for further surrounding areas, depending on the distance. If you call with special requests or large party orders, the chefs will accommodate you in a very timely manner - if it's not on the menu, just ask!  Just like the fish, the interior is raw. There is actually one very small table with some chairs around it by the front window, but I've never seen anyone sitting there. There's a display that sits just to the left when you walk in, covered with bags of Japanese snacks for purchase and, on your right, you'll find shelves filled with a few groceries; dried sheets of nori is one recognizable item that jumps out immediately.  Chef John Lee has been serving up fresh and beautiful sushi platters at this location since 2005. It is impressive to note that he worked under the iron chef himself, Morimoto. There is something soothing about the fact that they prepare your food behind the counter in full view. It's that commitment to preparing and presenting the freshest ingredients that has built their dedicated customer base.  Lunch combos range from $15 to $25 and dinner combos from $15 to $35. If you choose the sashimi - individual pieces of raw fish with no rice - it does bring the price up a bit, but it's well worth it for something so delectable. If ordering a la carte is more your style, there are unique rolls to choose from, including: nigiri sushi (fish on rice), small rolls, inside out rolls and special rolls with everything from eel to sea urchin to marinated dried pumpkin.  Our dinner for two was easily fulfilled with the vegetable sushi combo, which includes miso soup, and adding one Una Tekkyu roll (eel, tuna, cucumber, fish roe) and, my sushi must, an order of edamame. The vegetable rolls are prepped delicately to appear as if they too are made with tender slices of fish, the cucumber rolls are a refreshing addition and there is even a roll with an orange, crunchy vegetable called Burdock - carrot-like in appearance and texture, but with a different and unique flavour.  Their fresh ingredients are really the highlight. Nori can easily become chewy and tough, but Marche's is tender and graces the palate without even a hint of the unappealing sea-scent that you might get from a lesser sushi establishment. I have to say I'm not the biggest fan of the cold edamame they serve, but I wouldn't want to trek my raw fish home with something steaming hot resting on top of it anyway, so I don't mind this one pre-prepared item.  If your only sushi experience is picking up a pack of that generic grocery store stuff, with the fake green grass insert, Sushi Marche is really the place to discover all the glory of raw fish."}
{"text":"Has this place closed?  Tried calling a few times and just get an old voicemail saying they are closed on May 27th (It's june 26th today).  Would be a shame if it was! My favourite Sushi place in town."}
{"text":"Best sushi in all of Toronto! Very fresh sushi and the grilled black cod is to due for."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi restaurant, highly recommend, the service is great so is the food.  I do recommend the kamikaze roll, one of my favorite , ordered Double salmon and ebi ten asparagus maki tonight, love it!! The price is also reasonable, definitely come back to try more variety rolls!!"}
{"text":"Somewhat disappointing experience. Unpleasant service from the moment we asked if we could close the front door, because we wanted to eat in. The door was wide open and it was below zero outside. The tables were near the door.   And there was sushi... well, quite good taste-wise but not earth-shattering any longer. The biggest problem we had with it was that the fish in our 3 out of 5  Kamikaze rolls (salmon and tuna) pieces was the size of a pinky fingernai, and I am not exaggerating. We have been ordering from Sushi Marche for some time, and we got an impression that the portions are now smaller for the same price. I know at least one restaurant that served good food and was busy that did exaclty that - reduced their portions to avoid raising prices. They did not last even a year after that. A shame. People notice. And I think most people would rather see a slight incrase in price than tiny pieces of fish in their sushi. The cashier did not care much when we told her.  So we MIGHT give another try and eat there one more time, but if our next experience is eqally disappointing, we will find another favourite sushi place."}
{"text":"Best sushi take-out in town. Amazing quality of fish and friendly staff.  A little on the expensive side but they make up for it in all sorts of \"on-the-house\" extras..."}
{"text":"Fresh fish, possibly the best mackerel i have ever had, and John and his staff are super friendly, talented and a pleasure to watch.  Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"The only sushi I eat, in Toronto. Its always so fresh, rice seasoned so nicely and a great staff. The best!"}
{"text":"First time at sushi Marché,and loved it . For the quality of this sushi restaurant is a definite 5/5.I have had the sashimi dinner (very fresh) and kamikaze roll ( delicious) which I highly recommend.the salad with special house dressing was surprisingly good, the place is cute and tiny ! The service is very friendly! So call ahead if you have a large group . For take -out  or a casual sushi dinner I would absolutely recommend here!"}
{"text":"Too expensive, but it's the best raw fish I've ever shoved down my gullet.   Do yourself a favour and try the Kamikaze roll. Eat it! Now!"}
{"text":"Like all the other restaurants in Leslieville, it's another great addition to this serious up-and-coming neighbourhood.  That said, you wouldn't expect such great sushi from this place.  Why?  There's no seating (all take-out / delivery) and it's nothing but a basic kitchen set up with two guys working the sushi.  I did some research and found that the owner trained with Japanese Iron Chef himself - Morimoto!  While training is one thing - taste is another and to that point the sushi is fresh and first rate.  How do you know they're the real deal?  When they list something on the menu, they actually have it --- unlike most local sushi joints that claim to have certain types of fish only to carry your bulk barn tuna and salmon.  You can tell the place is gaining a big following judging by how much the phone was ringing for delivery orders. +ives: legit sushi chefs, variety -ives: pricey"}
{"text":"This is might be the best Sushi in Toronto.  Chef John is back supervising, preparing, and ordering the fish and it's made a huge it's brought back the reputation it deserves! The texture and the freshness is so impressive. The Yellowtail Sushi Rolls and the Black Cod are some of the best fish I've had.  You can really sense his passion for food flavour. The sushi rolls have a nice theme of sweetness combined with spice. Dude worked with the Iron Chef!  Service is friendly, it's a lot of young people being trained but they seem like kind hearted people. Nice for a relaxing dinner date, if you don't mind no liquor license (get over yourself, stop usually booze as a crutch!).   I can't stop coming back here."}
{"text":"When I allow myself to make the investment and drop some coin at Sushi Marche, I'm always hesitant to take it home and eat it. I mean, it always seems blasphemous to eat such amazing food sitting on my couch. The food from Marche is like an angel(fish) singing in your mouth, man.   I have this place on the speed dial on my cell. No joke."}
{"text":"First thing: the sushi was excellent and a reasonable price. 5/5 on the food.   But the restaurant building is strange. Next to no seating, doesn't seem to have a liquor license, and they were playing the backstreet boys pretty loudly when we went in on Friday night. Probably not a \"romantic date\" spot, but if you want amazing sushi take out, this is your spot."}
{"text":"Sometimes stellar, sometimes... not.  Seems like the delivery sometimes can result in sub-par experiences, but other times I've been elated by quality.  Last couple of times weren't great, may try again in the future.  Or may just hop a streetcar to Japango instead."}
{"text":"Sushi Marché used to be my favourite sushi place on those days I craved quality sushi. Under new ownership and name (Sushi Mugen) it is no longer the sushi sanctuary I once worshipped.   My sushi rice wasn't fully cooked; the rice didn't have the same flavour as I remembered; there were less pieces of sushi in the sushi lunch; the quality of the fish themselves seems inferior to before; and they replaced my beloved kamikaze rolls with the dreaded fake crab California rolls...with romaine lettuce. Who puts romaine lettuce in California rolls?  This is not the Sushi Marché I loved. Leslieville lost something special."}
{"text":"I really hate to do this.   As mentioned in my other reviews, we live practically next door and get takeout Sushi Marche regularly.  Some things have changed. The little grocery area is gone, and there is seating now. Also Jon and Wife seem to be gone, likely to the new location on Laird.   The last three visits have been EXTREMELY disappointing, and after 3, I can confirm that it was not an \"off\" night. Last night (my favorite: Maguro Kamikaze Gunkan Sushi) the tuna was the muddy grey colour of a cheap sushi joint. So much so that at first I thought that I had accidentally ordered the salmon.. or something. It was also very heavy on the rice. The  Kamikaze 1 had the most minuscule portion of salmon it was barely recognizable. Seriously barely a sliver with a tiny amount of roe, and 8 times the amount of crunch bit and mayo. The hamachi had the blood line attached (or whatever the dark bit was). I was crushed at how subpar my meal was, and for $22.   I don't think we can go here anymore. Not for the price. The platters we order are usually in the $60 to $80 range and it is not worth the value, when we can head to the Danforth and feed better for $35.   Jon Lee, PLEASE figure out why the quality has slipped so much and bring back the Sushi Marche of the past.   I hope things change."}
{"text":"I've had better sushi.  People rave about this place, and I've tried it.  It's not inexpensive, and really nothing to write home about.  Nice little retail unit though."}
{"text":"Showed up with friends on a Saturday afternoon, sign at the door states open noon until 10 pm, clearly not so.   Opted for the OPEN and friendly Kibo Sushi House nearby. Pity that Marché couldn't be bothered to accept lucrative business as advertised. FAIL."}
{"text":"i live in the beaches and this place is bar none the best. every meal looks like you should photograph it.  I love sushi , at least once or twice a month i get the craving.  This time the chef gave me free king crab,  wow......."}
{"text":"After reading reviews about this place, I decided to give it a try. My wife and I walked over 4 miles, and through some not so nice neighborhoods, just  to gets to this place.  The two people working were very nice. We ordered three different items. The price seemed a bit on the high side. And we were both disappointed with the Sushi itself. It was fresh, and it looks great, but I would give it an average score. Not great, and I'm not day dreaming about going back. This is our opinion, and some here think its great. We took a cab back. Like one person mentioned, I would advise driving or taking a cab after dark."}
{"text":"The decor in this formerly takeout only sushi restaurant leaves a lot to be desired, but I don't really care because it's the only good place to get sushi east of the DVP. Depending on the day, the fish can range from good to excellent. Preparation is usually very good, although I do miss the old guy who used to be the chef. He selected and cut the fish in a superior manner to the young guys who tradeoff days now. I appreciate they always have saba and often real shiso leaf. For those that know about sushi and want the good stuff, this is a little gem."}
{"text":"Popped in for a sit down lunch.  Decor is thrifty but didn't care. Ordered the Maki Lunch A. John, the owner served us. Brought us a house salad with a super tasty ginger garlic dressing, followed by Miso soup. He told us we could have free  refills on the soup. Soup was standard Miso, nothing earth shattering, but still pretty good. Loved the salad and delishious dressing. Onto the sushi.  I am not a sushi expert, I do eat at various sushi places around town however, I don't care for AYCI sushi and I know not to eat at AYCI sushi places. They differ greatly from good, quality sushi place. Sushi Marche is definitely up there on the great sushi scale. The Maki Lunch sushi was really really fresh tasting and so good. I was amazed at how soft and fresh the fish was. It melted in my mouth. The salmon and tuna were so fresh tasting. The rice was soft and held together so beautifully. Fabulous tasting sushi. Spoke to the owner when we were leaving, he shut down the other location so maybe he is concentrating all his efforts back on this place. Would I go again? You betcha!  One of the better sushi experiences I have had in this town."}
{"text":"friend and i were itching for sushi, and through yelp, found sushi marche.... and better still, since we were feeling lazy as hell, they offer delivery!!!! ($3 charge, but i think if you live closer, they don't charge)  their menu has a pretty good assortment of choices from your standard options, to more obscure items like yamagobo (mountain burdock), and ume kyu (plum paste with cucumber).  we were feeling pretty futsu (read: plain), so we went with a few options, and the highlights where:  - maguro sashimi (nice cuts, beatufiul presentation with the shiso even in a plastic takeout container) - tamago nigiri sushi (perfect level of sweetness and salty) - tekka maki (this came with a hint of negi/green onion that gave a really finish) - comment on the sushi rice: very tasty. good consistency. you can tell the person who made it knows what they are doing.   i will definitely order from them again... and plan to drop into the store one day....  random thought: not sure who originally picked up the phone to take my order, but it was clearly one of the japanese sushi chefs. he tried really hard with his English, and i give him mad props for making us both laugh with his explanation of yamabogo."}
{"text":"take out tip: if you call ahead to place your order, it takes about 45 minutes to an hour for your food to be prepared (or maybe that's just how friday evenings are). This take out sushi place can weigh a little heavy on the wallet but it's worth it. I had their veggie sushi dinner which is plenty of food - roasted red pepper, eggplant, king mushroom sushi, two enormous & nicely flavoured inari sushi (rice bags, as we bananas call them) and 3 pieces each of avocado, cucumber, green bean and kampyo rolls (the menu says oshinko and yamagobo which i was a bit disappointed because i prefer oshinko to cucumber and i was eager to have yamagobo which is burdock, a crunchy root vegetable). Since it was our first time coming here, I didn't know the wait would be so long but they were very friendly and gave us an extra fruit container with our meal. It also comes with miso soup or salad.  At the front of the place, there's different types of japanese food items for sale - containers of ice cream, wasabi, kewpie mayonnaise, pocky, dried wakame etc. I don't know if the prices are reasonable or not since there were no price tags.  It's nice to have a place to go to in case of a cooking emergency requirement for kombu and to have a great option for sushi in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I was in Leslieville this afternoon and had a craving for some sushi. So I bring up Yelp on my phone and Sushi Marche comes up as the closest sushi place. It's got 4 stars, not bad I say! So off we go to get some sushi.  I don't think I've been mislead by a Yelp rating this badly before... First, this place has a very odd and unpleasant smell. It's not a good thing when I'm grossed out even before ordering my food.  Then, the sushi is ok, and I mean it. It's not bad but it's not superb either. It's right down the middle. The prices, however, are ridiculous! They charge 30% - 50% more than most other sushi joints in Toronto. Cost me almost 30 dollars for a lunch \"special\" with a soup. I've had more and better sushi, with a drink, for less than that downtown.  What really annoyed me was that, once we ordered, it took over 20 minutes to get our food. WE WERE THE ONLY CUSTOMERS! It took a good 5 minutes for the sushi chef to actually come out from the back and START making the food. Then he made it at a snails pace while chatting it up with the cashier.  The food: 3 stars Everything else: Less than 1 star.  Do yourself a favour and skip this place."}
{"text":"It has limited ambience, no real seating, and the prices are higher than most of the nearby options.    However, the take-out sushi is better than most sit-down sushi restaurants, well prepared and well-presented in containers, fresh and delicious.  If you're looking for a pampered total experience, this wouldn't be your first choice, but if you're looking for top-class sushi that you can take away and enjoy at home, there's no better choice in the city that I've tried."}
{"text":"At night I pray to Neptune (is he the god of sushi?) and thank him for Sushi Marche. I also thank my lucky stars the BEST sushi in Toronto is in my hood. I also dream up new ways to use clichés to describe my love of this business.  I feel as if I was one of the first customers of Sushi Marche when they rolled into Leslieville a few years ago. The stretch of Queen East between, well, Yonge and Woodbine was void of any type of sushi for as long as I can remember, so I was eager to try out the new kid on the block.  The quality of their preparation and presentation was clear to see from day one--my platters would often come adorned with edible orchids and kumquats. Over the years I venture to say Sushi Marche has become my go-to for take-out food in Toronto and one of my most-recommended restaurants.  While everything I've ever tried is amazing (including their crazy-good green salads with miso dressing), I especially love the Kamikaze Rolls. These bites of heaven are hands down the best maki rolls I've ever tried. They have all the makings of the perfect bite: a bit of crunch, a bit of spice, a bit of creaminess and a little zing.  For special occasions I recommend determining a budget and asking the chef to whip something up, carte blanche. I've done this several times and my guests are always speechless.  Sure, sometimes it's really busy and orders take a long time, and it's quite expensive; however, I view these \"problems\" as a testament to their high quality and reluctance to become another fast-food take out joint."}
{"text":"Most definitely one of the most overrated sushi places in Leslieville. The food was average at best, and the service is what really makes this place worth 1 star.  Try to avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Not a great experience.  The sashimi was nice thick slices, the nigiri sushi was so so the eel was dried up and tough.  Rolls... I've had better.  Asked for extra ginger 3 times, never got it. That's okay turned out their ginger wasn't very good. The menu had no pictures & was very limited. Pricy for a takeout place only. I had a $30.00 Coupon from Living Social.  Ordered a $35.00 meal. They wouldn't accept it.  Claimed there were other rules to the coupon other than what was on the Living Social Site. Had to order more.  My meal for one person cost $45.00 otherwise they would not honor the coupon.... that was with no glass of vino and no sitdown or atmosphere. Just down the road at District you can get a truly premium sushi meal with sit down service and a nice big  glass of wine, truly tasty fresh sashimi and the yummiest rolls in town for the same money or less. And the service is great at District.  Skip this experience & head down the road."}
{"text":"I put a really last-minute order into Sushi Marche (because of their proximity to my home) on Saturday night for not one, not two, put 120 pieces of sushi and they totally delivered. Everyone commented on how delicious the sushi was and it went over really well.   That said, they weren't thrilled to take my order. There was a bit of huffing and puffing and long pauses during my order over the phone. But, when I showed up on time to pick it up, it was all ready and nicely packaged.   So, all in all, the sushi fantastic, the service, not so. This was my first experience with them and so I cannot compare it to the Sushi Marche that apparently existed previously, but I hope they can be more like and less like...this...."}
{"text":"while they don't have any seating at all and only serve take-out, they have earned the reputation of serving some of the best sushi in Toronto.  Owned and operated by Chef John Lee, who has trained under \"Iron Chef\" Masaharu Morimoto, they've gained somewhat of a fanatical following where patrons from all over (including myself) swear by the high quality and attention to detail of the sushi they serve.    If you're in the area for the day, stop by to pick up some sushi and head over to a park for a romantic lunch with your date."}
{"text":"The praise, the reviews, the self-promotion on the window aside, this place can be a replacement of my memories of a tiny take-out sushi spot near my old university campus.  Being near a campus meant value for those growing students that enjoy something special aside from KD.  That place didn't offer FRESH made 15-minute wait time Sushi though and didn't have a wide-smile sun-shiny lady(+1 *Star*) that took my order and suggested the Ebi Ten + Asparagus(8p/$8.00) while I added Scallop Nigiri(2p/$4.00) and Japanese Sea Bream Nigiri(2p/$7.00)  As I sat on 1 of 4 seats to await our Sushi Meal, there is an assortment of basic Japanese Grocery items for sale next to me.  There was a display fridge that was empty, but probably meant for quick pre-prepped food items for people on the go.  The friendly lady came towards me with a white plastic bag with Meal inside as I took it away to enjoy.  Scallop Nigiri, I was happy with especially at $2.00 a piece good  value.  Fresh and scallopy flavour as it should be but I noticed that the rice ball wasn't as prepared to standards.   The Japanese Sea Bream Nigiri was nice to try but it didn't leave me with much memory at all.  It's good if you haven't had the experience of Sea Bream lately.  At this price, I probably should have got the Uni instead.  Ebi Ten + Asparagus Roll(Shrimp Tempura, Asparagus, Spicy Sauce) left me in awe actually as you have to realize it is $1.00 per piece and it's one of the small(Loonie-sized) bites with no uniqueness from Rolls of any other places.  Spicy Sauce didn't have much flavour or spice even for me.  My friend just thought it was Soya Sauce."}
{"text":"Sushi Marche hits the spot in a pinch.  It's not the kind of sushi that causes me to toss my hands in the air with excitement, and it's not the type that has me avoiding a return either.  Somewhere between, if such a  place does exist.     It's a small restaurant, which poses, perhaps, as more a take out joint than anything, with limited seated, and decor to match such constraints.  The sushi, I find, is just ok.  Maybe a bit overpriced for the apparent quality of said food, but I don't wait long for my order, and the service seems friendly on most occasions.  This is where I go when I'm lacking the motivation to visit elsewhere for my fix.  So, generally, my expectations are not high going in, and are generally met as a result.  Sushi Marche is that mediocre date that has you wondering if you should follow up.  As in, yes, you had a \"nice\" time, and your date is a \"nice\" person, but do you really want to pursue something?  Would a second date really hurt?  Well, in this case, it really depends on how far I have to go to get there."}
{"text":"Came in here because I was with my friend and we were craving sushi and this placed looked cute so we hopped in. It's a cute little restaurant, nothing fancy. It was a Tuesday night so there was just one other person in the restaurant dining besides us.  The glasses we were served water in were dirty so we bought bottles drinks instead. The wait for our sushi was fairly long - around 30 mins - especially for such a dead day, and we were starving. But OMG! amazing sushi, best I've had so far. We got the dynamite roll, vegetarian roll and mango roll. All equally tasty. Will definitely come back and will definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent. I got delivery from here and it took approximately 25-30 minutes to arrive from the time I placed the order. Man o man was I exited when I took my first bite. They are so detailed in the presentation and preparation of their sashimi and sushi that I was taken a back. Slices of thinly cut limes/lemons were placed on different pieces of sashimi to add flavour and remain uber fresh. The sushi pieces were huge! I likey. I thought it was a little over-priced but after my meal I was so stuffed and elated that now I feel I owe them more money. March over to Marche. :P"}
{"text":"Best take-out sushi in town. Period. No frills. This is a place for people who know \"sushi,\" or shall we say foodies ( I hate that term).  Seriously though, Chef John Lee gives you the quality of high high end food at a fraction of the price. But you have to be patient. If you read all the bad reviews it has to do with hours of operation, delivery time, blah blah blah. All true. And that's that folks. You want friendly sit down with so-so sushi, walk down the block. If you want the real deal and eat like you mean it, come in and visit the Master. That's how I feel. Plus, if you are nice, he will throw in all sorts of freebies :)"}
{"text":"This is a solid as take-out sushi gets. Can be a long wait and is worth it. Not inexpensive but if you have a craving for quality fish..."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  Meh at worst.  The sushi and rolls did not stand out at all for me.  Friendly chefs and staff.   And the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"I'm upgrading my review.  I've been here a few times and I have to say, it's really delicious.  Lately I've been really into fancier rolls, but here, just a plain salmon roll is really like taking a bit out of heaven.  It's delectable and just melts in your mouth.  Even when it's take out.  There's something to be said for ambience (thus the 4 star rating), but the food is just good.  Pricey, but good.  I'm happy all day after having eaten here."}
{"text":"This is the best place I have ever had sushi.  It is obvious how fresh the ingredients are when you taste them.  they adorn the take out containers with ample wasabi, (could be slightly more ginger pehaps, though maybe im a piggy, who knows), a few pieces of fresh fruit, including this strange yellow berry, the name of which i dont know, but im sure successive reviewers will point out.  I usually have a spider roll/kamikazi roll which is soft shelled crab roll.  its very crunchy, large and tasty.  even more silky and slurpy is the unagi (bbq eel) either by itself or on rice.  My wife gets tofu covered rice sushi which is also quite tasty.  but biting into sashimi like their salmon or tuna is heavenly.  its so buttery and tasty.  for some extras try some of their gyozas and seaweed salad or buy a few different japanese treats while you wait for your sushi.  its made from scratch and with care so either call ahead or be prepared to chill and wait for it.  Youll have to take it home, as there is only one table.  No problem there;  who doesnt love curling up on the divan naked and feeding fish (or tofu) to their loved one?"}
{"text":"My daughter and I ordered from this place to mark a special occasion. The food was fine, once it arrived. I was told when ordering that it might be up to an hour. That seemed excessive to me, but it was a busy night. An hour came and went, and still no food. I called back, and whoever answered the phone could only tell me that our food was on it's way - not when it left or when it might arrive. By the time we ate, it was 90 minutes after we'd ordered. For a place that only does takeout, and charges $5 for delivery, this was too much. We won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have come here often in the past, but had been away for a bit and decided to go back.  Sadly, it`s not the same place we remember. :( The sushi was ok, not the AMAZING experience we recalled.  The Miso was the best part! The service. . . Terrible! The woman who was running the cash this time around was possibly the most unhappy/grouchy Japanese woman I had ever met!  Sadly, I'd rather the congestion of T&T for the same basic quality."}
{"text":"You're not going to find better take out (of any kind) in the east end. The sushi is masterfully prepared and expensive (this isn't all you can eat, remember) but totally worth it. It's not something for everyday (who could afford it?) but it is worthy of a monthly treat.  Here's what Toronto Life had to say: http://www.torontolife.com/guide/restaurants/japanese/sushi-marche/"}
{"text":"Sushi Marche is one of the best sushi places in the city.  John Lee creates extraordinary morsels of sushi, sashimi and rolls.  I highly recommend the Ebi Ten and asparagus, Eel and Avocado and the Spicy Tuna.  The miso soup is always piping hot. The hamachi and salmon sashimi are melt in your mouth fresh.  We were lucky enough to enjoy John's hot dishes too such as the black cod in a miso glaze which was delicious (almost as good as Nobu's).  The price point is fair - I want quality vs. quantity when it comes to eating raw fish.  I would recommend Sushi Marche to the most critical sushi aficionado."}
{"text":"For whatever the reason, John and family no longer run the place.  I wish them all the best and hope they are well.   Having said that, the marche or whatever it is called now serves run of the mill supermarket quality fish and craftsmanship. The new operators are not familiar with authentic names, don't use quality ingredients, shiso was replaced with lettuce... So I am giving up on this place and what used to be our weekly omakase platter. But judging from the nonchalant service on my last visit, I don't think the operators give a crap about my business and whether I go back anyway."}
{"text":"It seems like sushi tastes are as diverse and contredictory as a person's scent preferences... one person's Chanel No 5 is another's Grandma Mothball elixir. Sadly for Sushi Marché I am leaning towards the mothballs!  I have no cawlms about blaming this sushi snafu on Steeven L. who insisted on grabbing sushi lunch in Leslieville. Much like ordering poutine in Alaska, I am always a bit weary of ordering ethnic/culturally renown foods in areas which lack that ethnicity/culture. But I was hungry, in the area and thought the Yelp reviews looked great...  Upon entering the \"restaurant\" I understood why everyone mentioned that this is really more of a take out place. There were two tables shoved in the corner of the room and you have to order at the counter.  It seemed like every combo came with California rolls (which I despise). I asked if I could substitute the California with something else if I paid extra and at first the answer was no. I scanned through the menu some more and after about a minute the cashier said I could sub for 1$.  The food took forever to be ready. As the only ones in the place 20 minutes was un acceptable. I got 5 pieces of Salmon roll, 5 pieces of Kamikaze roll, and a soup for $15! The fish was fresh but way too over priced for lunch. Also their Kamikaze roll isn't all that great and I left the restaurant still hungry. :-("}
{"text":"Definitely fresh and authentic sushi . Food was awesome , absolutely wonderful sushi. The waitress was very attentive to our table.my friend and I both ordered a couple rolls ( ebi ten asparagus and Kani banzai) must try! We also ordered a couple pieces of sushi ( maguro and yellowtail) THe maguro was definitely my favorite as it almost felt like it melted in my mouth . This spot is best sushi restaurant I've ever tried. I'll coming back soon!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars  This recent visit to Sushi Marche is a little let down, compare to my previous experience.  The sushi are not tasting as good. Maybe I have tried Taro's Fish and that experiene have change my idea or standard of what good sushi are like??   I would still drop by for my sushi fix in the area.. but their sushi would not be the one that I dream about when I have the cravings!!"}
