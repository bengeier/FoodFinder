{"text":"My wife and I love Thai Square. We order take out from here at least 3 times a month. I love their Vegetable Pad Thai, Vegetable Spicy Noodles, Mei Goreng and Basil Fried Rice. They also have very good Spring Rolls. They give you a lot of food for the money. Unlike other small take out places, this place is very clean, I have never seen it look dirty. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the people that take your order can be a little rude some times, especially the older guy that is usually at the counter. The food is very good, so we suck it up and deal with it."}
{"text":"LOVED this hidden gem. 

The dining area is small but cosy. Service is super speedy ( food was ready in 15 mins). The prices are reasonable and worth every penny.

Ordered the Chicken Pad Thai, which was creamy, peanutty and absolutely delicious, Also had the Beef with eggplant, which was out of this world! Creamy nuggets of fried eggplant with succulent beef and a touch of spice.

Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"5 stars (for take-out); not recommended for dine-in (no liquor licence). 

Definitely one of the best Thai places I've been to in a long time. In my opinion, it doesn't get much better than this. Everything was delicious not too salty, not too greasy and not too spicy like a lot of other places tend to do.

Everything tasted authentic and myself and whole family thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We will be back again."}
{"text":"Fantastic Place, Great Food, Quality Chicken (Not Fatty / Not Chewy).  
The quality is good enough, they don't have to cover it in batter.

My faves: Chili Chicken / Cashew Nut Chicken / Chicken w/ Peanut Sauce.

I highly recommend.  If I lived closer, I'd probably eat here three times a day :-)"}
{"text":"Good food!  Great staff!  Shitty dinning area.  Love the pad thai, Pineapple Fried Rice and their Mango Salad.  Lunch menu is pretty cheap and it's available from 11am - 3:30pm."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai Chicken and Shrimp is 5 extra dollars (than the Pad Thai Chicken) and you only get 2 pieces of shrimp. Should have just bought a shrimp cocktail from the Metro next door and put them in... Would have gotten more for the same amount. I feel VERY unbelievably cheated by this restaurant. When I first called, he didn't even take my full order- hung up half way. I had to call back and he again hung up and didn't tell me a time it would be ready. I've tipped this restaurant $3 before for my takeout and am very very displeased. $16 for what you see in this pic... Noodles are worth maybe a dollar for a bag of them and this is mostly noodle!"}
{"text":"Yummy. Lots of variety. You need to ask for spicy, even on items marked spicy. 

Items run heavier on oil, even compared to other Thai places. 

Highly recommend the Garlic Eggplant and the Basil Fried Rice. They throw in free items the more you order, so go crazy."}
{"text":"I really like the beef Pad Thai.  The wife and split an order with some spring rolls and an order of Chicken Satay."}
{"text":"One night at my parents place in Scarberia I was craving Pad Thai. So I looked up local thai restaurants and found this place. It's tucked away in a small plaza,  next to a shoppers drug mart and a metro on Port Union and Lawson. At first I was hesitant because, they didn't ask how hot I wanted the food (usually a red light for pad thai), and when I goto to the place and it was empty. However, I just chalked that one up to it being 9pm on a Monday night and went ahead and grabbed my food (I wouldn't have bailed on the order at that point anyway, Douche-Move!). 

I have to say I was definitely impressed, I have had good Thai and horrible ketchup noodle crap before, and this was definitely good Thai food. The spring rolls were good, the vegetarian pad thai was good, they asked if I wanted it egg free, so I guess I could have gotten it more vegetarian if I really wanted it. I really liked this pad thai place, it is a good pad thai place, and not good like \"It's food for a pad thai place in scarborough\" , I mean it's just a really good thai place, and I would go back and eat here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely hate this place, bad service and I got food poisoning. Couldn't get up for days. Beware of this place."}
{"text":"I thought the pad Thai was okay. I ordered chicken pad Thai for my friend and I. When I opened it my meal I was surprised to see nuts on top of the pad Thai. My friend wouldnt even eat it I thought it was a good size for the money, but I think Ill make my own next time. Remember its personal preference, others have liked it but its not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"So we'd passed this place a bunch of times and I know that there are a lot of Thai places around, but not so many who also do Malaysian food, so I thought this might be worth trying. It's a tiny place, more set up for take out, but with one table for 4 and another 3 or 4 tables that can seat two. It's nothing fancy, but as soon as we placed our order, we could hear them chopping in the kitchen and smell them cooking our food (the walls don't all go up to the ceiling so you can smell all of the tantalizing scents of our fantastic food cooking). At that point I knew we had a gem on our hands. Everything was fresh and wonderfully tasty! We ordered the Appetizer Combo plate (for 2, $14.95). It was GREAT! It comes with 2 full-sized skewers of Shrimp Satay, Mango Salad, Spring Rolls, Salad Roll, Lightly Breaded Calamari, Fresh Rolls and Samosas it also comes with a dipping sauce for the rolls and a peanut sauce for the satay. I loved everything. I'd say my least favourite were the samosas (good, but nothing exciting) but everything else was super fresh and tasty! That alone would have been enough to make a completely satisfying dinner for two. However, we'd also ordered the Chili Chicken which came sauteed with fresh red and green peppers and onions (boyfriend commented and was impressed with how fresh the peppers were). This was really flavourful, but be careful - we eat a lot of spicy foods and have a pretty high tolerance but this definitely has kick - but flavourful! They also sell cute glass bottles of Coca-Cola and Sprite (only $1.50 if memory serves) - remember you can justify it with \"Sweet cuts the heat\"! I want to eat some now - it was SO fresh and flavourful! I'm already trying to narrow down what I'm going to order next time we go!"}
{"text":"Thai Square first opened its doors in this sleepy West Rouge plaza a few years ago and I thought, \"yay, finally...there is a Thai place nearby!\"  I've eaten in the restaurant, ordered delivery and take-outs numerous times so I can safely say that my review is based on handful of dining experiences. 

When I first tried Thai Square, the owners were Chinese so naturally, their dishes had some distinctively non-Thai influence.  I tend to judge Thai restaurants by their pad thai, green curries and beef salad and let's just say, all three dishes were lacking in real Thai flavours like galangal, lime leaves, tamarind paste, toasted rice powder... to name a few.  But all in all, as a neighborhood Thai-style restaurant, this place was fine.  

Fast forward a year or so, what was once an acceptable Thai imitation fare has undergone drastic change to something less than desirable.  I'm sure the ownership must have changed hands but the cashier profusely denies this (to what end, I do not know). 

I had some people coming over so we ordered take-out consisting of Chicken green curry, basil chicken, thai fried rice, pad see ew, mango salad and beef salad.  Since our order came to more than $35, I had a choice of receiving a complimentary samosas, spring rolls or pad thai.  I opted to receive free pad thai.  

Every dish was on the sweet side which was a BIG minus for me but the Thai style fried rice and the basil chicken were still edible.  The mango salad and the beef salad were also acceptably \"Thai\" tasting.  However, the Pad See Ew and the complimentary Pad Thai were a sorry excuse for a fried noodle dish, lacking in ingredients (nothing but dried chicken pieces and tiny Chinese broccoli pieces in a mound of over-fried thick rice noodles) and flavour.  I would have to say that this was the worst tasting Pad Thai I've ever had in my entire life.  

Between too-sweet green curry and over-fried noodle dishes, I may just have to give up on Thai Square all together now.  Sometimes it's just not worth while to suffer the mediocre imitation fare just because it happens to be nearby and convenient."}
{"text":"I've passed this establishment a few times over the years and today thought I'd give it a try to satisfy my Thai food craving. They have some  7.95 lunch specials which include a hot & sour soup and spring roll or mango salad. 

I decided to try the chicken Pad Thai.  Because it's a Thai place...it's gotta be good right?  Well.  I was wrong. Maybe I am spoiled having lived in midtown/downtown where there is really good Thai food restaurants....because this pad Thai was pretty bad. It was overly \"ketchup-py\" and the noodles were soft and over cooked. I am not at all a picky eater but I just couldn't eat it and had to leave it behind. The hot & sour soup was very spicy.   Which is ok if you like spicy.  But I told the order taker that I didn't want anything spicy. So I couldn't eat that too.  You'd think he would have warned me considering I specified it upfront and could've ordered mango salad instead. The only thing I ate was the spring roll. It was good. 

I wish I could say better about this place considering the good ratings and reviews. But I was extremely disappointed. I will not return. It was only an $8 Meal...but when all I could eat was the spring roll, that's pretty sad."}
{"text":"The pad Thai is to die for! They also have amazing smoothies that you need to try. I also like how they have the glass bottles of soda. Service is average and staff is
Friendly. Would recommend if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This is a small walk-in restaurant with little bit of seating. Nice clean restaurant and friendly staff.

I had pad Thai here the number of times and it is always great. Huge portions. I've also had a fried fish dish and pineapple fried rice. They never disappoint.

Recently one of the staff told me their chicken is halal. Verify this if you want to ensure u have up to date info."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had so far. Tinny place but the food is sensational and the service outstanding. Tried the curry fried rice and the coconut soup and they were delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout. Service was great. Got curry pad Thai and red curry. Both were delicious. Would definitely order again from here!"}
