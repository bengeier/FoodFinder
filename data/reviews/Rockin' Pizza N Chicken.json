{"text":"Delicious pizza, excellent crust, quality toppings, good customer service & affordable prices :)  Edit: This is STILL the best pizza Mississauga (and much of the GTA!) has to offer!! Do yourself a favour and order their Italian sausage on your pizza, with a side order of their creamy garlic sauce. Yuuumm!   The pizza is consistently good and always of the same quality. Thank you Rockin' Pizza!  I wouldn't listen to the guy whining about the quality of freshness as my family has been ordering food from Rockin' Pizza since they opened and it is always fresh."}
{"text":"Great family run joint and pretty decent for getting pizza for a good price . They put lots of toppings and the crust tasted good as well. I would prefer this hands down over pizza pizza for a Pizza run..  Owners are really nice and I like that it's a family running the place."}
{"text":"Pizza was just OK.. The staff is friendly, I'll give them that. Large pizza for $10?? Not bad.. You'd be better off paying $13 and getting your pizza from Whole Foods by Square One."}
{"text":"Great Place! Their pizza's are delicious. We go often that they know us here. We live close by so we call and 15 mins later our order is fresh, hot and waiting for us. Staff is  friendly and the service is great. Prices are very affordable too. Many mouth watering ice cream flavors."}
{"text":"This place is a gem and I've been ordering from here for a few years now. The prices are good and the food is always fresh and delicious and they have the best crust. Free delivery is a huge plus."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday afternoon and they refused to offer me the student deal even though I was a student. Apparently the student special is only for catholic district (the school right behind them) students and they didn't have class this Friday so that means the deal doesn't apply EVEN though I'm a student...it clearly says the deal is on Mon-Fri until 3pm too. Sad.   Been a long time customer here... I guess they care more about saving a free pop than honouring their own deal."}
{"text":"We got their pizza and wings! Not bad at all. It's close by, economical and good! We will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"The pizza was ok, best pizza in Mississauga not even close! If you are looking for a well made delicious pizza there are better places than this. Their chicken wings were either under cooked or rotten as I got food poisoning from them and spent the night in the hospital. I would rather call a chain again then order from a place that doesn't use the freshest of ingredients or bother ensuring their food is cooked all the way through."}
{"text":"Their pizza is decent.  I like the crust, not too thick.  The prices are really good compared to any franchises in Toronto ...  $10 for this"}
{"text":"Great pizza and amazing customer service! Always my family's go to pizza place! When ever we have people over they always ask if we can order Rockin Pizza! Very reasonable and great quality! You will definitely not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is bomb as hell. It really tickles my pickle but other than that you guys really need to get some tables and chairs up in there."}
{"text":"Located in a small plaza that you might miss if you don't live in the neighbourhood. Great pizza and wings for a decent price!   Happy:  If you don't eat cheese, you can sub it with another topic of your choice. They were on time for the pick-up. A medium size pizza can last me a dinner and a lunch. The wings are spicy, just the way I like them!   Not happy:  Their ice cream is bought. Perhaps they should invest in gelato.   Verdict:  Not sure what to cook for dinner? This is a place to go to! The pizza is the right thickness and enough toppings to please the eye."}
{"text":"Was happen to be around the area n kids wanted pizza do thought to give it a try.   Pizza was moist, freshly made n delicious! Loved the corn mill crust.    Couldn't give 5 stars cause the cashier girl didn't look happy or made me feel welcome. I felt like I had to rush to order lol. Other down side was they didn't have seating to eat in so we had to eat in our car."}
{"text":"Great food for a decent price. I will definitelybe a repeat customer. Ordered thin crust well done pizzas and got exactly what iwanted."}
{"text":"Great pizza and an even better price. I also recommend the wings in honey garlic. So good. The rockin family rock pack is an awesome deal."}
