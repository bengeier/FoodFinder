{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner on Saturday, 4/18/15.  We both had their prime rib special that included salad, baked potatoes and garlic bread.  My wife ordered the small prime rib and I ordered the medium.  Portion sizes were very large, I probably should have ordered the small also.    The service was prompt and the food was excellent.  We will definitely go back as they had a nice menu selection.  Very nice country town bar environment and nice crowd.  Oh, by the way, I ate all my prime rib."}
{"text":"My wife started getting me burgers from this local dive bar/diner years ago and I've been hooked since. The burgers are juicy, flavorful, and a little messy , like a good burger should be. I've only been in the business one time (to pick up a double cheese burger) and the to-go service was bar-rific: The bar tender greeted the local folks by name as they came in all the while taking your order and giving her straight forward opinion about whatever was on the tube.... Nice.  This ain't no fancy joint, but the food sure is tasty."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Special nights are through the week and breakfast is simple easy and delicious."}
{"text":"Maybe you have they have to know you in order to be pleasant toward you? They seemed to be fine with other customers, but were COMPLETELY rude to us when I brought my family from out of town to try it out when I first moved here. We weren't difficult, in fact we tried to make his life easier, but he seemed annoyed by us asking his opinion, or a refill on our drinks (ya know, after 30min of no attention). Food was less-than decent. 10/10 times would go to Middlefield Tavern instead."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner Monday night and glad we did.  It was Cheeseburger basket night and couldn't beat the price anywhere for such a great burger.  We also ordered a Walleye dinner that was fabulous - three good sized filets with a bountiful side of fries.   The service was great and our waitress was a real hoot.  We'll ll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends and enjoy the environment.  Whether they are having a band, karaoke or the local magician is bar tending and performing card tricks this is an excellent place.  Lately Saturday nights have been really fun with karaoke, videos and a few line dances.  Oh and don't forget the food!  Great!!"}
