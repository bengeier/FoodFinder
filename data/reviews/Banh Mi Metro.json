{"text":"I love Pho Metro and decided to give the banh mi a try. Going into it I knew it was more expensive than going to Chinatown and picking a classic one with cold cuts. I tried the lemongrass chicken which comes with your standard pickled carrots, cucumber and cilantro and if you like spicy they add jalape√±os. In my opinion was good but not extraordinary and probably a little steep for $6.50 + tax. It wasn't gushing with flavour and spices but I would give it another chance and try the pork belly or the beef and maybe it will change my mind."}
{"text":"Pho Metro opened up a banh mi place next door! Starting at $4.25, they're not super cheap as banh mi's go, but they're also not super expensive. The menu is mostly banh mi's, but they have Hong Kong waffles, kimchi fries, and home fries, as well as a number of vietnamese desserts. I'm assuming Hong Kong waffle is a bubble waffle, but they didn't know enough English to explain it to me, and they told me they didn't have the ingredients for that or the fries yet. 

My mom wanted our classic banh mi extra toasted. The lady who made it said that she did toast it and that it was hot. Yeah. Mom wanted something the texture of crouton. Hot just ain't gonna do it. The banh mi was pretty good. More filling than the typical T&T one. 

They've got a grand opening sign up right now. It's 10% off. For a place that has officially grand opened, it looks like it's in soft opening stages. Incomplete menu and renovations are still underway. They plan on adding tables so people can sit down, but right now, it looks like the only thing ready for business is their service counter and their drink fridge. It's a tad odd, but when we paid, the lady at the counter tried to charge us regular price. I had to remind her of their 10% off banner outside. Huh. I'll chalk it up to them being new..."}
{"text":"Tasty - reasonably priced - quick service 

This was my first experience with Banh Mi. I'm a huge fan of Pho Metro which is connected to Banh Mi Metro - so I figured there's no way I could go wrong right? Right. 

The space is newly opened and still under construction which I'm not mad about because they're service is on point. They were quick but still very nice. The menu isn't extravagant by any means it's just an assortment of Banh Mi sandwiches and two types of sides once of while being kimchi fries. I got the chicken banh mi and it was absolutely amazing. The chicken was flavourful and juicy. The slaw was also fresh, crispy and sweet. So into it. The baguette was also a good size, I'd say maybe 9-10 inches. It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The worst is when you bite into a baguette and have to fight with it... this was not the case.

I would definitely recommend this place and I will be back to try their other banh mi sandwiches. They also had pre packaged meals and traditional viet foods, my friend bought so Vietnamese sausage."}
{"text":"So far i tried the cold cut, beef & chicken banh mi and they were all good. I'm on a mission to try all the items on their menu because I love their food! Try it before it starts getting busy!"}
{"text":"Finally, a Banh Mi option in Scarborough closer to home. The shop is pretty new and tied to the existing Pho Metro restaurant.

The menu is pretty simple with a few options to choose from. I ordered the standard Assorted Banh Mi which came wth the usual fixings. The bread is a standard French style baguette, quite fresh with lots of crunch. The veggies were all nice and fresh. The cold cuts and pate were quite good. The pate in particular is very, and a bit peppery which I like. 

Uptown there aren't many choices and I usually go to Nguyen Huong for fresh Banh Mi. Banh Mi Metro prices are OK but for the difference in price I'd rather go to Nguyen Huong. The quality just isn't good enough to justify paying 50% more. Overall, still a good sandwich."}
{"text":"came to try their banh mi's since i'm a fan of pho metro! the banh mi itself was pretty good i was say. i don't believe it's the kind of baguette i was expecting, it's a bit more dense not as fluffy or crunchy as i prefer. the meats were great, i even asked for extra pate as well as extra chilis and fresh carrots/radish. i really appreciated that they make it fresh and on the spot. the only downside is, considering the area and the size of the banh mi (average size, not large) it was kind of pricier than normal. it was $4.75 (hence the 3 star, or it would've been 4) ... i don't mean to compare it to Nguyen Huong but it's hard not to. they are the OG of banh mis and i love their baguettes - must softer and fluffier to my liking. at Nguyen Huong it's $3.50 for a large baguette and i would say a small is more comparable to Metro! however, i wouldn't be opposed to coming back, it's definitely closer to work."}
{"text":"The Banh Mi taste amazing especially with the freshly grilled meat. The restaurant it's attached to is pretty cramped but the doesn't really matter to me."}
