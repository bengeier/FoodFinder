{"text":"Great food, great service. Ask for Kathy... She is the most personable and sweetest waitress I've ever met."}
{"text":"I saw a lot of items on this menu that I'd not seen at other sushi places; a lot of them fried or including meat.  I guess that reflects the local palette, and I'm not going to take off any points for that.  I sat at the bar and found it clean, and bustling.    I ordered a few traditional rolls, and although the service was quite slow (the barman  apologized more than once), everything tasted well prepared and carefully. The presentation was rushed on one of the rolls, but impeccable on the others.  The fish tasted fresh, and you could tell the three guys making everything had their hands full.  I respect that, but I feel they could probably hire a fourth chef. This was a Thursday dinner service, and it was a full house.    This place cares about what they do, the price is right, and it was nice to see it was a family run restaurant, with brothers and sisters of employees stopping in throughout the night. The barman was incredibly attentive and seemed to know plenty of customers by name (and by order, apparently).  Also, the guy will put on the game if you ask, and to be honest, I sort of like that when I'm sitting solo at the bar.  Points are off for the speed, otherwise would be a solid 4."}
{"text":"Not sure how other people can give this place anything better than two stars.  I ate here as one of first places when I moved a little over a month ago and it was just not good.  The rice on all the sushi was mushy.  The sushi chefs didn't look like they cared very much about the sanitation of their prep areas.  Not a fan..."}
{"text":"I love this place. It consistently gives good Americanized sushi. They have a decent selection and rarely have I tried something that I did not enjoy, like uni (this is more a taste/texture preference than a judgement of the restaurant). They have a sushi bar, that also has booze, which is a great way to quickly get a sushi/sake meal and some good conversation from the friendly bar tender and your fellow sushi eaters. If you're craving a more authentic Japanese food experience, don't go here, but when you just want sushi, this is your spot!"}
{"text":"I love the yakitori, but leaving out scallions in the menu description is a \"fail\". Three times now I have ordered a lemon drop shot,,, to be Givin a martini with attitude that a shot is a martini....not to mention  the pink mold covered sinks in the ladies room.  Yuck) I always loved this place...but damn.  Get it together"}
{"text":"Really good but not spectacular.  Portion size was plenty for me.  I ordered two rolls and could not finish.  The soft shell crab was awesome as well as the spicy salmon.    This is a good, reliable, cheapish place for regular sushi.  I like the bar as well."}
{"text":"I used to eat at this place quite. However, I had a bad experience when arriving one lunch time and being ignored at the door waiting to be seated. Servers just kept going about pretending I was not there. Waited 10 minutes standing before leaving. Will not return. Food is OK, However, the service needs much improvement. Decor is average."}
{"text":"I used to love Sushi 101. It was my go to sushi spot. But the past few times we've gone, the service has not been great. On my last visit, my order did not go through and the bartender was very, very rude when I inquired and acted like I was an inconvenience. My roll did not taste fresh. It had a funky aftertaste and I couldn't eat it. What happened Sushi 101?"}
{"text":"Top 3 best sushi places in the Queen City! We love sushi 101 or (sushi LOL) as my husband likes to call it! Great choice for lunch or dinner. Gyozas wont disappoint!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing shrimp fried rice and you get enough to eat for three days. The Professor is my favorite sushi roll. They have good noodle bowls too. The drink specials are always good. $3 wells on Wed. Nice atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"Good service, good food, but have gotten sick after from it before so can't recommend."}
{"text":"Sushi 101 is pretty close to our house, so I checked it out when my husband was gone, and I was craving sushi.  I just ordered take-out then, since it was just me.  I went in, had a great conversation with the bartender, and got my food and paid pretty quickly.  When I got home and ate it all, I was super satisfied.  I had gotten the Miso soup, Rock n Roll Roll, and the Spicy Tuna roll.  All of these were really great, although they were heavy-handed with the aioli on the Rock n Roll.  Tonight we went for dinner with another couple, and the experience was again very pleasant.  I think one of their greatest assets is a knowledgeable and friendly staff.  Our waitress was very nice, patient, and quick to deliver on special requests.   We ordered a lot of food.  My husband does not like sushi, but he ordered some fried rice and some tempura chicken, grilled beef, and fried chicken.  He gave his meal 3 stars, because he said things were average.  He actually enjoyed the sashimi appetizer most of all, which I also thought was good.   The sushi rolls were good, I enjoyed the ones I got. I got yellowfin tuna and eel, and also the Sweet potato tempura roll, which was a nice surprise that I had never had before.  The other couple loves Sushi 101, and got a ridiculous amount of stuff that I will not list out.  My one overall complaint is that the menu is way too long and difficult to digest.  I ended up stumbling through my order, simply because I had to keep flipping back and forth.  It flustered even a seasoned sushi eater (I was trying to accommodate the recommendations made by the other couple I was with).  The outdoor seating area is actually pretty nice, especially when it is beautiful outside!  Everyone had a great time and left satisfied--the hallmark of a great meal."}
{"text":"The service was terrible, we were not sure of who our server was, and it seemed to be they did not either. The food was barely at par, nothing special. I used a card to pay, and when I checked my transactions, they had taken more than what I had written. Never going back...that is unprofessional and immoral to take more money than expected, on a business level as well as personal."}
{"text":"I am new to the Charlotte area so I don't know if the sushi in this area is similar to Sushi 101 in quality, taste or size.  I do know that the menus I've reviewed online talk about sushi in different terms (i.e. \"crunch\" instead of panko flakes).  The prices here are comparable to other sushi places I've eaten around the country.  I was unimpressed by the taste of the rolls, finding them rather bland.  I'm wondering if the fish was previously frozen instead of fresh but I'm really not sure.    The \"hot lava sauce\" seems to be merely a puddle of sriracha sauce put on the side instead of being mixed in with Q-P mayo or some other ingrediant.  The rolls were rather loosely rolled, falling apart easily.   I thought the size of the rolls were rather small for the price though this may be standard for the area.  Ambience and service were good but I hoped for better quality.  I doubt I would go back.  The sushi was in general mediocre."}
{"text":"No longer impressed w/ Sushi 101...We usually love this place and always order a noodle bowl.But this time, the serving was half the size it normally is. Not sure what the deal is, but it was like an episode of Brain Games.. is it the same size portion or a different size bowl..? Either way,we left hungry and not happy..farewell sushi 101"}
{"text":"My quest for decent sushi at a decent price continued, this time at popular south charlotte locale \"Sushi 101\". Located in an unassuming building in an even more unassuming shopping center my heart began to sink as I resigned myself to another subpar sushi experience. Fortunately I was proven (kind of) wrong.   Ordered the lettuce wraps appetizer. Four leaves of lettuce with crunchy straws and some chicken and what not on it. Much like the restaurant as a whole my food appeared rather underwhelming but as the saying goes \"Never judge a book by looks can be deceiving\" (lil' platitude portmanteau for ya). It was delicious. In addition I ordered a few pieces of nagiri (spicy tuna, 2 dollars each) which were pretty good. I also \"sampled\" (read: took off my dining compatriots plates) several other rolls and pieces and was generally pleased with what I tasted; as were the.  The night I went (a Monday) the bar had martinis on sale for 3 dollars. While I've never really seen a James Bond movie, I am familiar with his work and opted to have a martini for the first time in my life. Ordering my martini the same way I keep my room (dirty) I was overwhelmed by the sheer strength of it. I don't know if I and the people at my table (my dirty, and two others got the watermelon martini) just got a rough batch or they pour 'em strong at Sushi 101 but the drinks were pawned off on me as my friends weren't as intimate with the flavor of rubbing alcohol as I was. I of course obliged. So, super strong (some may say unpalatable?) drinks; I don't know if thats a pro or a con for you.   I'd give it 3 and a half stars but I can't do halves on Yelp.  To recap; decent food at prices that won't blow you away but are rather par for the course."}
{"text":"It's ok.  Nothing spectacular, but not gross and disgusting either.    When I first visited Sushi 101 in 2004, I was much more impressed.  Either that was due to inexperience with eating sushi at the time, or they must have cut some corners since then.    I returned in April, 2010, for the first time in about 4 years.  Their lunch specials allow ZERO room for substitutions.  They are very strict about this.  They might serve salmon sushi lunch specials every day for a week, and if you ask if they switch it up to say, tuna, they won't.  Period.    The rolls are typical, standard stuff.  There isn't a single roll that seems uniquely theirs.    The environment is nice, though a little loud.  They have nice lighting, a few televisions by the bar.  It's great if you have a large party, but for intimate settings, there have got to be better places to go in the area.  Business lunches run about an hour, so if you only get half an hour for lunch, go elsewhere.  They do get a full house for lunches, so make sure you have an entire hour.    They used to deliver.  I don't know if they still do this, but that was a nice service they provided."}
{"text":"Never try udon noodles.  Worse than 5 min microwave noodle bowls I think it should be removed from the menuj"}
{"text":"This restaurant has always been the safe go-to sushi restaurant for us. The fish is fresh, but not the freshness. The roll selection is ok but not fantastic. There isn't a lot of creativity here with the selection. All that said, its a staple to us and we will always continue to go to the restaurant. it's also worth noting that it is a very family friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"So disappointing. I've eaten here twice: once tonight and once a few months ago. When I ate here a few months ago, we found some of the food (noodle bowl) flavorless and lacking, but some food (yakitori sticks) tasty and very reasonably priced. Tonight, I was disappointed all around. We had another noodle bowl, bland and flavorless as before. The yakitori was previously $2 for 2 skewers and is now $4 each skewer. The average adult could consume 4 sticks and consider it an appetizer. Moreover, because they don't bring everything to the table at once, I didn't realize until we left that we were shorted three skewers from the bill I paid. The ahi poke was okay, but not worth $12 for a tiny portion. The restaurant is also extremely loud and hot, and our server forgot to refill our drinks. All in all, a sad show and definitely not a repeat."}
{"text":"Was told on the phone 20 minutes for take out and sat there for an hour waiting for my food. Bartender was extremely rude about the entire process. Saw others be seated, get their food delivered, and got their check before I got my food. Kind of ridiculous."}
{"text":"Bottom Line:  Good sushi and friendly service. The waitress even saw that we had a citipass coupon and took it off our bill without us even asking!  This was a great place to go for a quick bite of Sushi for my wife and I with our 1 year old in tow.  This is of course not a fancy restaurant or \"fine cuisine.\"  But the service was great and I would recommend to anybody who wants some reasonably priced tasty Sushi and doesn't have a lot of time.    Probably the most impressive thing for me was that Lee Ann, our waitress, noticed that we had a citipass coupon sitting on the table and took it off our bill before she even brought it to us.  This never happens anywhere and I greatly appreciated it."}
{"text":"I think there is no other way to say this other then this is the best sushi restaurant NC! I have been going here since I have moved here which is about 12 years now and it has always impressed me and my family every time. There sushi is the BEST along with the soups, salads, and fried rice, and the best thing is good food quality that is consist. I have always gotten there California role since the first day I have went and it is the same as it is now, amazing, and then I started to get there Miso soup and Chicken fried rice which are also Amazing. I HIGHLY recommend going there for lunch and dinner because it never disappoints and there will be something there you will like."}
{"text":"Four stars?  OK.  I'd prefer 3.5, really.  Let me start by saying: I'm no connoisseur of sushi.  I stick to rolls, and most of the time I only get cooked or vegetable rolls.  I've only gotten sushi at a couple places in Charlotte.  I have consumed sushi from a supermarket and I did not really mind it.  I know that sushi can be a very opinionated topic, so to those that have a more robust appreciation of sushi: sorry for muddying the review with my decidedly unadventurous palette.  All that said, we go here on a regular basis.  A wide variety of rolls for me to choose from.  I particularly the Tempura Veggie Maki, and the Crispy California Roll is another favorite among my friends.  Their mixed green salad has a delicious ginger dressing.  They have a variety of other foods which I have had occasion to sample, but don't make a regular part of my dining here.  For example, the yakitori is good.  The fried rice often has an inexplicable smoky taste to it; my S.O. and I can no longer bear to eat it.  This same smokiness also infused a noodle bowl I got with chicken in broth.  I don't know if this is some Japanese thing (do they smoke the chicken?) but I wish they'd, like... stop.  Still, its the rolls that keep me coming back.  Service at Park Rd. is almost uniformly good, probably aided by the fact that the restaurant is, for the most part, one long strip of tables; your waiter/waitress can't help but walk past your table.  (I wish I could say the same for the service at the University location.)  Prices are, in my experience with sushi restaurants, very reasonable.  Is this the best sushi in Charlotte?  I don't know.  It is, however, good enough to keep me coming back, and has a sufficiently varied menu to keep me from looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"We used to Frequent this Sushi place all the time. We moved out of NC and recently came back and since we loved them figured we would starting eating here. Unfortunately the food not as good as we remembered. We only eat at Jade in Ballantyne the Sushi is much fresher and we find it to be excellent..."}
{"text":"Food is good if they don't mess it up.  It is pricey, but tastes good.  Problem is that I've waited over an hour (80 minutes) as I'm writing this review just to receive my order.  Just sushi so they don't even have to cook the food.  The food may be good but if they won't make it, you can't eat it."}
{"text":"We loved ALL the food. Gyoza pan fried were delicious as well as the shrimp tempura. We really liked that they had seperate dipping sauces, not just some generic sauce for every plate.  I had $3 glasses of yummy house wine!  My husband got the professor vu roll and chicken and tofu yakatori and raved about it all.  I had the sir justin roll (per the server's recommendation) and the dragon roll, both were fantastic but the sir justin was the clear winner.  Even my husband loved it more than anything else. Beautiful presentation of delicious and fresh fish.    Service was great, our server was knowledgeable about the menu and answered all of our questions and gave great recommendations.    ONLY complaint- canned sodas! My husband doesn't like alcohol and loves his soda so it was a little inconvenient."}
{"text":"While I would not consider Sushi 101 a traditional Sushi restaurant that is the exact reason I enjoyed it so much.The Wait staff is knowledgeable and friendly ,the food superb and the atmosphere relaxed all things necessary for an enjoyable lunch or casual dinner.the Chef's Choice @ Lunchtime is one of the best values in town. ENJOY!!!!!"}
{"text":"This meal was literally sooo gross. The teriyaki chicken was repulsive. I almost couldn't get the first couple bites down and don't let that sentence mislead you, I didn't finish the meal. Another thing was the rice, simply disgusting. Then after all of this disappointment, the waitress spilt soy sauce on my friend pants. If you're looking for good hibachi do not go here! They don't even have white sauce... Like Japanese say what."}
{"text":"A very reliable spot for sushi. Consistent. They do not do your typical lunch combo but they have some creative small plates / apps that make up for it. Little pricy."}
{"text":"When you are looking to just get a roll, some nigiri/sashimi or want to go for some octopus...this is the place! Great place and also affordable"}
{"text":"When in Charlotte always enjoyed sushi at Ballaytne location. First visit to Woodlawn location. Lunch special was great value. 2 rolls for$7.95. Sushi was good, not great, but for the price, highly recommend. Very attentive service."}
{"text":"Where did my super-efficient server go? Why are there weird pressboard walls separating me from the now ample staff so I can't make eye contact with them and get my miso already?   The sushi is still mediocre, but I can't really balance it out with fantastic service anymore. I miss you, fantastic server. At least they still have the inexplicable hieroglyph menus."}
{"text":"Not sure what you expect from a sushi place but this gets the job done. It has a very large variety but you might be missing the super-expensive dishes from other places. Did I say that it has very good prices?  My favourite dish is the \"Canadian something something\" (what a good memory)."}
{"text":"Great food, terribly slow takeout service. Bar attendant took 20 minutes to recognize she had us waiting to order on a very slow night. I won't be eating here again until the staffs performance changes."}
{"text":"One of our PAK members let us know about Sushi 101. Eating out for an allergic family can be quite difficult but Sushi 101 was very accommodating. \"We revisited Sushi101 as a family last week. They did and excellent job with our various restrictions. (PN/TN/GF/DF++) my stir fry was made without soy sauce. I don't know if I'd trust for soy cross contact though. Manager checked over my allergens list, so I felt comfortable with their level of care.\""}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The service by Mariana, Millie & Hank was outstanding, and we couldn't have been more impressed! It was a wonderful break from our work-day, and had so much fun. Thanks again to you all!"}
{"text":"Yes I am one of the people who come here when sob is packed. At first this place didn't seem bad. Nice ambiance and the food was passable. But whenever I ordered a Korean dish and one of the Korean appetizer is finished, they are very very VERY unwilling to stock up the appetizer, sometimes just telling you a straight out no that they don't have that dish anymore. Absurd. Almost every other Korean restaurants stocks them up! Recently they raised the prices by a lot and just yesterday when my bf and I were walking along bloor we saw that it has closed down. Surprise surprise."}
{"text":"Good variety on the menu (at least as far as non-traditional rolls go ... the deep fried stuff, the gajillion combinations, etc).  Came at a strange time (end of lunch) and service was good.  Sushi was not bad, but not great.  I would say this came across as a reasonable sushi option ... I doubt you'll go truly wrong here, but there are better to be found in South Charlotte."}
{"text":"Very good Sushi. Relaxing atmosphere.  The rainbow roll is a must have. Both my wife and were very happy and will be coming back."}
{"text":"Went here last night with my lady. The service took forever and it was just decent sushi. I had to literally walk over to get a waiter to come to our table then again to bring us the check. Seems like they've went downhill since my last visit"}
{"text":"Good service, their portions are a lot bigger than other places, and it tastes delicious. I've tried a few of their dishes but the Super Canadian Special remains my absolute favorite, everything I love about sushi on one plate!  Overshadowed by Sushi on Bloor (a usual crowd favorite), this place definitely deserves a lot more recognition. I'd pick Sushi 101 over Sushi on Bloor for as long as they carry the Super Canadian Special on their menu :)"}
{"text":"The food was ok. The service here was below average. Our server wasn't attentive whatsoever.. I don't know if he was new or he's just like that. We accidentally spilled our tea.. So instead of the server rushing up to help us try to clean it, our server and another walked by twice without even saying a word. We had to bring it up to him. The sushi here is just alright, it wasn't bad but it wasn't the best.  I wouldn't visit this location again"}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight. It was great! I enjoyed the ballantyne roll, surf n turf roll and the spicy katsu chicken roll.I ordered a side of miso soup and had kikkokomen plum wine. Yummy! Check out their menu for the roll ingredients. I was so hungry I forgot to take pics.If you are a sushi connoisseur like myself you might think the menu is a little commercial, but it's a great place to take a newbie sushi eater. There is something good to eat for everyone, no matter what their taste buds desire,even vegans. Check it out you wont be disappointed. Since it's Friday I expected them to be packed, but they weren't and i got my food in less than 15 minutes. My server Allison was great and she knew the menu and best tasty choices. The men who prepared my meal also greeted me and asked how I liked every thing."}
{"text":"Consistently good sushi - friendly staff, some have been there over 10 year!  Nice atmosphere, sit at sushi bar & watch the magic happen. Professor Vu roll (yummy)"}
{"text":"The consistency of the quality of the foods they serve aren't really the same. I went here a few times and I thought it was okay at first, but after one time after eating, I had food poisoning and got sick for the whole day. I don't know if it was just past the expiration date or something, but I wouldn't take my chances after that. I'm not coming here anymore."}
{"text":"This is one of those places I would recommend all the sushi lovers to check out. From outside, the restaurant looked smaller but as we got in it looked spacious enough. I'm a vegetarian and had variety of options to choose. We have tried vegetarian lettuce wraps, noodle bowl and sushi rolls. Every thing we ate was tasty and mouthwatering. The waitress was not annoying at all and was periodically checking us about the order. I would say everything was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I think the sushi is pretty good, but they got my takeout order wrong for the second time in a row. The service was terribleand they had no kids menu/options- they wouldn't even work with me to get him something to eat. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"LOVE IT!  We are regulars here and enjoy our sushi! Always consistent, great staff, good prices (matters when you go every week! )"}
{"text":"I know better than to expect great sushi in Charlotte, but I just ate here about a week ago and I wasn't just disappointed -- I was grossed out.  The (raw fish) sushi was warmer than room temperature.  How dangerous is that? My dining companion eats here regularly (why?) and states that is normal.  I value my health too much to try it again."}
{"text":"Another sushi joint right beside Sushi on Bloor.  Nothing special, I ordered the chicken teriyaki & tempura bento lunch special.  It came with the usual rice, salad, miso soup."}
{"text":"Came here last night for a quick dinner.   Sushi 101 is tucked away across the street from Park Road Shopping. We were there on a Tuesday and the drink special was $1 domestic beer...score! I noticed they had decent drink specials almost every day.  We ordered the goyza to start. 8 came out in the serving (good portion) with the yummy dipping sauce. They had steamed them in this woven basket thing. My husband made the comment that when he was in China, they served goyza this way there too. Very good.  Next we split 3 rolls: Spicy tuna, Panther roll (geez....we really have a Panther problem...I mean the Panthers are 12-0 so that means this rolls HAS to be good!), and Panhandle roll. All came out fairly quickly. I thought they all had a bit too much rice on them for my taste. The Panther roll was by far the best (see, good call!)! The Panhandle roll was pretty good but I actually didn't care for the Siracha on top, I think it was just too much. The spicy tuna was an A-Ok roll.  Overall, we had some tasty sushi at a fairly decent price. As this place is very close to our home, this may become our go to take out sushi place!"}
{"text":"The sushi we got from here was pretty good--probably my favorite sushi spot we've been to since moving to Charlotte.  The rolls were fresh and tasty.  The salad was ok-it was kind of watery and there wasn't enough dressing for it, but it was still good.  There are a decent amount of options for sushi and noodle dishes."}
{"text":"We walked into a crowded foyer. The restaurant itself wasn't crowded. There clearly needs to be more staff. Two waiters were clearly being overtasked. They were trying to be the hostess, bidder and waiter at the same time. Patrons clearly weren't happy and were impatient with the lack of attention. We've been sitting here for fifteen minutes. We haven't been approached for drinks or water. Incredibly hard to capture the waiters attention. The family of five behind us left after not being paid attention to.   To the owner: we get that you want to save money and not hire a hostess or extra waiter, but at what cost? The patrons are unhappy and that keeps their tips low. The food is not good enough to keep attracting customers. Fix your system because the poor waiters are suffering and you're just driving customers away. I will not be coming back for mediocre food and terrible service."}
{"text":"Husband and I came to Sushi 101 on a Tuesday night because....$1 beers! Yes.. $1 domestic beers are what's up. The sushi is good, but not as good as Ru Sans and also more expensive than Ru Sans.  The price does not match the quality of sushi you are served. Their name advertises exactly what they deliver; a beginners style sushi. But did I mention $1 beers on Tuesday!? ;-)"}
{"text":"First of all...If I could give this place 0 Stars, I would!! So after ordering our drinks, it took 10-15mins for the waiter to come back to take our order and he only came at that point because I had to ask him to take it. Then we received our apps and meal (neither of which our waiter brought out) and didn't hear from him again until I had to ask him to refill my drink. When he finally did make another appearance, he asked how the food was and my friend said she thought something was a little off with the seaweed around the sushi and he asked if she was ever sensitive to it. She says no and that she eats here all the time and never experienced this. He takes our plates and then comes back and says, you were probably just overly sensitive to it tonight. So instead of just apologizing and that being the end of it, he basically blames my friend for the food being bad.   Ultimately...would NOT suggest this place if you expect to be treated like a paying customer should be."}
{"text":"This is a good sushi place but the design inside is terrible it's dirty. Also I had to wait an hour for my such and ate it in five minutes. I would recommend this to someone only if you are next to it but don't even bother to drive more than 5 miles to eat here."}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of Sushi 101 for years.  I seldom get around to the University location- but that one is my favorite.  At both locations; they consistently serve up great sushi & the noodle bowls are delicious too!  And the service is so quick.  I'm talking- in and out in under 20 minutes.  Which can be a major bonus at times."}
{"text":"The lunch specials are really good most days. The staff is still great.   Speed of service at lunch has gotten pretty fast over the last several months.  Defiantly enjoy going here every few weeks for lunch."}
{"text":"My new favorite Sushi spot in the QC after Rusaan's fell off.  Sushi 101 is my ideal Sushi joint, laid back and Americanized with plasma TVs with SportsCenter.  Large portraits of American Pop Star's like Gwen Stefani adorn the walls and the staff is very friendly.  I've eaten most of the sushi on the menu, and have come to order the same things now that I know what i really want, and the following list gets my mouth watering regularly at which times I gotta grab my girl and hit up Sushi 101.  My recommendations begin with the Tempura shrimp appetizer, lightly friend jumbo plump shrimp, almost big enough to be prawns, taste incredible, the light batter adds a crunchiness and a sweetness to the natural flavor of the shrimp...money.  I follow this up with a large beer, usually Kirin Ichiban or Sapporo Gold, and a large Carafe of the house Hot Saki  Follow this up with an order of 8 orders of salmon sashimi and 8 orders of tuna, and I am not only full, but extremely happy. Not the most exotic order, but its my favorite and Sushi 101 does the basics so well I not only give them 5 stars, but my repeat repeat business, I mean at least once a week, Thursdays are great cause its not too crowded and you also tend to get bigger cuts of tuna and salmon."}
{"text":"Though I'm a big fan of sushi and routinely crave the stuff, I realize that my enthusiasm, as genuine as it may be, by no means makes me any sort of authority or aficionado, which I'm acknowledging from the get-go. Also, in the interest of full disclosure, I still haven't graduated to eating sashimi and need my lovely lumps of tuna and salmon to be swathed by the protective merchants of yumminess known as rice and seaweed.  Ok, still with me?   My second, or maybe third (?) time at Sushi 101, which is a name I sorta dig since it acknowledges its not-too-lofty ambitions, was by far the worst.  The place was empty save for one girl who was apparently waiting for someone and was there before we arrived and two girls who were settling up before we ordered. Service should be lightning-quick then, one would think? Wrong.   I ordered the maki combo, which comes with California rolls, tuna and salmon rolls, which I asked to be made spicy. Obstacle number one. Our waitress seemed a touch flummoxed by my request and then said she'd have to ask. (I'm pretty sure that making said rolls spicy amounts to adding some sort of hot mayo-esque sauce to the fish, but I could be wrong.) She then tried to up-sell me another combo, which had more and/or different fish but came with the spicy varieties. I told her that I still wanted the same amount of fish, just hotter, and really was going to go with whichever was cheaper - my original option it turns out.  My friend ordered the vegetarian combo with no special requests, thankfully. We both ordered a glass of wine and water, which didn't arrive until after our dinner, and even then when we were in the throes of wasabi-overkill.  We then waited for over half an hour for our fish. Thankfully, we had (slightly too-salty) miso soup and salad to tide us over, but given that we were effectively their only customers at this point, I wasn't sure what the holdup was.  When the food came, granted it was pretty delish, and my tuna and salmon rolls were appropriately fiery and given the hefty portion size, I even had enough for lunch the next day.   Which brings me to asking for it to be wrapped up. Maybe this is common practice and realistically, it wasn't a deal breaker for me, to quote Liz Lemon, but the waitress simply brought me the carton and was on her way. I've never been asked to put together my own doggy bag and wasn't appalled by the request in an 'I'm-too-good-for-that' way, just more taken aback since I wasn't expecting it. My friend, though, seemed pretty livid and hissed, \"Like an animal!\" which actually made me laugh. How many animals package their own leftovers? She's funny.  All in all, the food was decent, middle-of-the-road sushi, which is usually enough to satisfy me since I really just want that fish-rice-seaweed-soy-sauce combo but the service left me wanting more.   Can't imagine how this place would fare during dinner rush hour - eep."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Sushi in Charlotte!!!!!!! I've been to a bunch of places in and around Charlotte, and let me tell you, I have never had better service!!! The serving staff was great and the chefs were so skilled in the way the interacted with us and served us some of the best sushi I have ever had! If you either live in Charlotte or are visiting, this is THE place you need to check out!!!!!"}
{"text":"They have changed the menu in a not good way. No more dollar salmon sushi. No more sashimi trio appetizer. Prices are up. No longer a value and frankly other sushi places are better for the price.  I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have lived in the area of this place for some time and can say that I have seen it's appeal drop.  There are less people and the food is just ok.  Even the ambiance of the  place is muted from what I remember in the past.  Had dinner on a Wednesday night and the place was not very busy.  I agree with a prior review that the weeknight crew must not be the A team.  There did not seem to be any urgency from anyone.  Our dinner was just that... an average dinner that I would have or could have prepared at home.  No spectacular or overly fresh ingredients or even tastes that I could have said were awesome.  My sushi was un-inspired and well... just ok.  The fish was not sashimi quality or fresh from the freezer.  My selection turned out to be a small rainbow roll on a really big plate.  If anything the plate selection promoted my feeling of disappointment in the size of the roll.  I really did not understand the approach for the vegetable tempura.  It must have been the creation of a chef on a limited budget.  Think cut vegetables from a bag pressed into a box form, battered, deep fried, and sliced.  I actually wondered what they used for tempura batter and it was over cooked and dripping with oil."}
{"text":"umm I will never go here again and never recommend this place..  In fact 2 of my other friends that went on different days than i did agree with me on this one...  I had the special combo sushi roll meal thing they had and it was really bad.. I felt soo hungry after eating lunch here that I ended up having an early dinner..."}
{"text":"I love this place! My husband and two kids love it too! Always great food. Favorite sushi in Charlotte. The Prof Vu roll is one of our favorites. The portion of seaweed salad you get for the price is great! The best is actually the dessert! They have this fried cake of sorts with ice team that is to die for. It is a must!!!!! We have had a few times that some servers have been a little better than others but nothing significant.   I agree with one review that they could clean the tables a little more. Still love it and will always go back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the most consistent Sushi restaurants in Charlotte for the money. Every now and then I will get some tuna that isn't as fresh as it could be. They have some creative rolls and good appetizer selections. The Tuna Tataki is a great starter. Service is usually attentive and efficient.  The Salmon (sashimi or nigiri) is usually very fresh tasting. Great spot to satisfy the everyday Sushi craving."}
{"text":"Open til Midnight on Friday and Saturday - the reason we tend to visit Sushi 101 most of the time.  Likes - you can select the style of noodle dish (i.e. with broth, without broth), the proteins, and the type of noodles. Tempura is always yummy, light and crisp. We like to ask that the tempura comes on the side if we are having tempura noodles to keep it that way throughout the meal.  Dislikes - Inconsistency. We ordered the S&S 101 combo ($25 - a good deal in my opinion so we order it often). It's Sashimi, nigiri, and a rainbow roll. Sometimes the sashimi is cut thick, fresh and nice. Sometimes, like this night, not so much. Perhaps the chefs got lazy because it was later in the night (around 10:45 pm when we placed our order) but it was like they took the slices for nigiri and just rolled it up into the rose pattern.  We tend to stay away from the other entrees. Ordered the duck entree once and was not impressed. The sushi and noodles are good for the price, so we will keep going there - maybe staying away from the sashimi on late nights going forward."}
{"text":"Quick recap: amazing sushi, never had a plate I didn't enjoy. Very reasonably priced, great atmosphere and the service is usually on point. One of the better sushi places in town.   With all that being said, the last time I went, my dragon roll was mostly avocado and no real amounts of meat was inside the roll. However the taste was still there and on point. I have been here on many occasions and this was the first time I came across this issue.   Some rolls are a bit small so keep that in mind if you are truly hungry."}
{"text":"Sushi 101 is one of the first restaurants I happened to find when I first moved to Charlotte in June, 2011 but, I have not been there until tonight. Now I'm kicking myself for not going earlier.   We walked in the bar and immediately greeted and told we could sit where ever we want. It was a very casual place with a come as you are vibe.    The server was very friendly and made a point to check on us without being bothersome. I was able to ask questions and she was knowledgeable with her answers.   I ordered 2 sushi rolls, salad, and miso soup for myself. My only complaint was the salad was too large and the dressing tasted like there was a touch of mustard. I would probably not order that again. The sushi tasted very fresh and was some of the best I've tried in Charlotte.   My daughter ordered miso soup and nothing green and fried rice with only egg. There was no problem with her special request and the food came out exactly as she asked.  I wanted to try sushi tonight, but they have different versions of noodles on the menu. One is served in a broth as a soup. For this, you are able to choose your type of noodle and the protein. I would like to come back soon to try this. Perhaps this weekend."}
{"text":"I love this place. Dragon rolls. I'm simple in my sushi choices- I've been at the beginner level for a long time but I like what I like. At least I've moved on from California rolls.   My husband and I went to dinner here one time and sat at the counter. I had a book with me over to my left and we were chatting when this small slab of sashimi lands on the book. I was shocked at first- I didn't expect to see anything flying in a restaurant. I looked up at the kitchen and there were 3 sushi chefs all staring at me in horror- they had tossed a piece of sashimi and it was all a big accident. I thought this was hilarious. We all got a good laugh out of it. It has endeared me even more to this place."}
{"text":"Horrible. I don't even see how you people can think its good? I had once piece of California maki and almost puked. Their soups have no flavor and over priced one word horrid!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, this restaurant is too small, too loud and not very nice, but the food is DELICIOUS. Their sushi tastes so fresh and their yakitori skewers are mouth-watering. They have a great menu with many different choices so everyone in your party is bound to find something they would like to order. I don't go here that often because I don't like being so close to the tables around me, but when I'm looking to save some money while not sacrificing quality, this is my go-to."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's a bit noisy and sometimes hard to get a table (especially Friday night) but the service is very good and the sushi is very good -- some of it is quite eclectic so if you are a sushi purist you may not like some of their more unusual stuff, like the fried entries.  But overall it's fun and tasty and has a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"No matter where I visit, I must have sushi.  Knowing this, my dearest brother brought me here.  In all honesty, not real memorable.  Need to start writing down what I have.  However, my mother who doesn't eat sushi/rolls ordered the lettuce cups.  They were good.   Meh... I've got nothing."}
{"text":"Sushi 101 rocks!!! Saw Mark C's post couldn't believe it till I looked at his other restaurants.  He's just trying to reroute business to the New Zealand Cafe. What a shitty  and lame way to do it!!  The rolls at sushi are fun a creative.  The owners the staff are very friendly. I've been a regular for over 5 years. It's the \"Cheers\" of sushi restaurants in Charlotte.  :)"}
{"text":"One of our favorite date night destinations, Sushi 101 is consistently good with great service. We went wild and got the Chef's Choice Sashimi last visit, and the manager came to our table to explain what was on our beautiful platter. We are now big fans of the hamachi and mackerel - things we probably wouldn't have ordered a la carte on our own.   The rolls are always great, but it was fun for us to try something new in a place we trust."}
{"text":"We usually visit this place when I can choose lunch with co-workers. I really like this place because they have something for everyone. They have a great lunch sushi special for $7.95 (2ish rolls of their choosing for that day).   We always get the edamame which is a delicious way to start the meal. I normally get the noodle bowl with Ramen. I got the glass noodles once, and definitely prefer Ramen. I've tried the regular style with veggies and the soup style with broth, and prefer the regular style. It comes with all sorts of veggies that you can customize to any way you want.   A great, quick lunch place that is very reliable for good food."}
{"text":"I was across the street in the Park Place shopping center and decided to get some sushi. Well actually, I had been craving sushi all week, and figured this was the time to try something different. I had heard some really good things about Sushi 101 and there are multiple locations so I knew that I would be in good hands.  Well, I really wanted to like this place...I did but in my book it was just average.   I stopped in a little after 1:30, I wanted to make sure I missed the heavy lunch crowd. Lucky for me the place was pretty empty. I scored a seat right in from by the window and was presented a menu. The menu is pretty extensive so that was very impressive. And they have a pretty good wine list and daily drink specials...whoo hoo!  In an effort to \"try something new\" I got the Crispy California Roll which comes topped with napoli sauce. Think delicious california roll...deep fried...classic flavors a little bit of crunch...  I really don't know what to say...other than it was just okay. I really did enjoyed the napoli sauce ! But everything else was just pretty basic. Nothing really stood out to me, I mean don't get me wrong, it was not bad by any means. It just didn't WOW me.   However, service was good. And the prices are very reasonable. I'm going to give them another try. Maybe with a different roll and a drink special I'll become a fan!"}
{"text":"Not impressed by the sushi and many people seem to have issues with the service, though I can't attest to that. The sushi is not bad, but I prefer Mr.Tokyo 100,000% over this place. They do have a nice bar area and are a good option for sushi and a drink (though kind of pricey) but hey, you have to be willing to spend, ya know? I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a decently busy Friday night, to an empty hostess stand. We were ignored by the guy behind the bar in the green shirt, but not by the college-age kids who made sarcastic \"rock 'n' roll!\" comments in our direction. Later, Mr. Green Shirt doled out orders to various staff members, so I assume he was the owner or at the very least the manager? Wearing a neon t-shirt is probably not what you want to do if you don't want attention drawn to yourself as the guy in charge, that's management 101.  Before too long, a server awkwardly took us to a table (and I mean VERY awkwardly, it was obvious she was only doing it because she had to). She brought our drink orders quickly and asked us if we wanted straws. Again, awkward, but we shrugged it off. She was visibly annoyed that we didn't know what we wanted yet, and made sure to ask every 2 or so minutes. We got a cucumber roll and the Mt. Fuji roll (which didn't come out quite as described - it was supposedly \"flash fried\", but the only evidence of this was a tiny bit of tempura flake next to the seaweed and the mildly warm temperature of the roll. Also, \"hot lava sauce\" is just a puddle of spicy mayo with a bit of sriracha sauce in the middle, yawn), neither of which tasted remarkably fresh, but weren't fishy or anything either. The miso soup was actually above average. We still had a couple of pieces of maki left when she asked if she could take our plates. When we said no, she asked \"Can I bring the check then?\" The hours on the door said they were open for a good 3 more hours, so I don't understand the rush. By this point we were more than ready to leave and not come back.  Weird vibe, awkward service, no free refills on soda (or so we were told), mediocre-at-best but overpriced sushi and I ended up being ill to my stomach later. Sushi 101, go back to school."}
{"text":"We come once a week and get an appetizer and sushi with a few drinks.   In the past 4-6 weeks the service has gotten horrible.  They forget everything we order from the entire meal, the salad, our sauces to additional drinks.... split the check all wrong and make you wave them down to get something.  Turnover off staff is constant so I'm guessing it's a management issue. I think we are done giving them one more try. Its s very frustrating dining experience but good sushi."}
{"text":"I have eaten a lot of sushi over the past 20 years and it is hard to find a good, yet affordable place to frequent regularly. My favs are too expensive to hit every time I get a craving. Sushi 101 is the perfect middle ground.   Great sushi locale for lunch.  Not pricy just because it could be.  Great food at a good value."}
{"text":"Server was very attentive and love the fact they offered the Kirin in large bottle. I got a noodle bowl with portobello mushrooms... It was terrible, had no taste and the noodle portion was very little. Everyone compliment the sushi... I guess I should of tried that"}
{"text":"Dropping a star because the yakisoba is overly complicated.  If you order yakisoba, make sure to ask for the \"regular\" noodles or they may give you the healthy kind which don't taste as good.  And even then, depending on which chef is working at the moment, you may still get a confusing bowl of soggy noodles.  Traditional yakisoba is made with egg noodles.  The soba noodles they try to force on you here completely change the flavor and texture of the dish and they don't pan fry the same way at all.  If you tried yakisoba here and didn't like it, make sure you try it at another restaurant because it's not authentic in any way shape or form!  And if you tried the soba noodles and didn't like it you still shouldn't write off soba.  It's also prepared completely differently in Japan.  Sushi 101's Americanizations of these two dishes really botch it for me.  That said, the nigiri, sushi and maki seem high quality and made fresh to me, although I don't eat them very often.  I go for the izakaya items like yakitori (chicken skewers) which are pretty reliable.  This place has the best asparagus and beef skewers I've had outside of Japan.  A lot of the other items are hit or miss so you're just going to have to poke around.  It's worth a try but unfortunately seems best if you go in with \"low\" expectations.  I've been able to find a few things that work for me and it's very affordable so worth coming back if you peg a few things you like."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a snack today. I have been dining at Sushi 101 for about 10 years and love it. The place was empty but it was an unusual time of day, 3pm on a Sunday. The Host was very nice. I always love when I am greeted with a smile. I chose to sit at the sushi bar. The Host took my drink order and food order promptly. I had the Squid Salad and Spider Roll. The salad was perfect but the roll was a little disappointing. The middle pieces of the roll had no Spider, ie. Soft Shell Crab, bummer! Definitely not the norm for Sushi 101.   The Host and the Waitress came over several times to check on me. Yeah I know they were probably bored but it still made me feel semi special.  As I was leaving the Kitchen staff AND the Host bid me a fond farewell. Seriously, a girl can get use to that kind of attention."}
{"text":"My co-worker took me to this place and I will say the food is pretty good. I can't remember all the items that I've had from here but I will say that every time the sushi was pretty darn good. I was never disappointed with the serving size, the fish or quality. The sushi was super fresh and flavorful.   The place is pretty cool, clean and chill. This is probably best for lunch/early dinner dates or just to hang out with friends. I'm not sure about the weekend or evening times because I do not live in the area but it's the perfect place to have a good lunch. This is one of those stop by for lunch and then run to TJ MAXX or Burlington for some light shopping.   If I'm ever back in the area, I would probably stop by here for lunch."}
{"text":"Sushi 101 rocks! Great variety and SO tasty! Service was excellent as well! They have great drink specials throughout the week ($3 wine on Sundays & $1 domestics on Tuesdays!) . We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"A GOOD place for  sushi.  Can't beat the lunch special.  It's chef's choice but I have never been served one that I didn't like.   I realize that people are particular about their sushi. I just don't understand the bad reviews. My coworkers and I eat there once a week at lunch.  Service is always good, sushi is fresh and flavorful and the restaurant is clean.  For the money this is a great value."}
{"text":"Best sushi in South Charlotte. Love the professor VU roll. Friendly wait staff. New floor looks great!"}
{"text":"Heard that this place was decent and decided to give it a try when I had a hankering for sushi on a random Thursday night.  The place isn't anything special on the outside and looks like any other typical sushi place.  I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised to get nice portions for the specialty \"spicy tuna deluxe\" and that it was more tuna and less rice than your regular rolls.  I also got some salmon nigiri and they were only $1 each.  I saw on the board that they have drink specials and will definitely be back to do try their $2 sake martinis.  We just took our food to go, but the staff seemed friendly enough and there were enough people there on that late Thursday night to let me know it's worth coming back."}
{"text":"If your looking for a good lunch special for $10 Sushi 101 always has a good deal - usually 2 huge rolls that are hard for one person to finish.  Other then that there is nothing too special about this place - the sushi is decent there is a large selection on the menu, service is ok.  I find it a little pricey for what you get.  The sushi bar is nice.  If you are in the area check them out for lunch."}
{"text":"I had heard mixed things about Sushi 101 and hadn't worked up the pre-meal courage to give it a go. One of my good friends and I wanted to grab some sushi for lunch one day and recommended it, so I happily obliged. I'm thrilled that we ended up the 101!   It's an elongated set up. Long bar, a few tables along the wall, some high tops, and dimly lit. A few TVs and really strange local art -- all depicting celebrities of some sort. I recall seeing John Candy and Gwen Stefani of all people... Not sure of the motif they are shooting for, but it definitely stands out!  For lunch, this place is a freaking steal. Me and my buddy sat at the bar and ordered 20 pieces of tuna, salmon, mackerel, and hamachi sashimi, and we each ordered the lunch special -- a crunchy asparagus roll and an eel maki. The eel was pretty nasty. The brown, sweet, smoky sauce on top was a total ruin. It would have been much better sans the death liquid. The crunchy asparagus was divine. Holy wow. That sashimi? Right on the money, son! Goodness we chowed down and even ordered a second round! Fresh, flavorful, and a great choice for sharing. I even ordered one of the lunch specials for my wife, to go, and our bill was only $40! FOR EVERYTHING. I was shocked. Seriously a great deal for a sushi lunch.   My biggest complaint is the temperature. This place was set at 60 degrees and I had to run and grab a jacket because the door kept swinging open. It just kept getting colder and colder. Not a huge deal and I would still eat here if it were set at 30 degrees!  They have some funky hours and I think dinner is served late.   I'm definitely looking forward to lunch here again soon."}
{"text":"Great customer service and great sushi. We came in late after a work event probably 30 min before they closed. They treated us just like we were their first costumers of the day.  Jay, I think that's his name, was a fantastic server!"}
{"text":"Pending review. ..I tried deleting my review since I meant to review the other sushi 101.  I'll update once I try this actually spot."}
{"text":"I grew up in new England with great seafood.   I've always thought Portland had the best and freshest seafood until I had sushi 101.  I only get sashimi everything else is a filler to me.   The fish was fresh and proportion were very generous.   I've been in Charlotte for two weeks and I've gone there twice and going tomorrow.   Also the bacon scallops  for 3 bucks is a killer deal.    I'm a fan.   I'm still exploring so I'll might be back to change the rating."}
{"text":"This place has gone down in quality of food.  Staff turnover each time since last couple visits.  This will be the last time for us."}
{"text":"I ordered Chirashi Sushi at this restaurant and totally disappointed.  It was not even close to what it suppose to be.  If all Sushi 101 serves Chirashi Sushi this way then franchise owners should do something about it,  its so wrong. If your customer didn't even eat more than 2 bites,don't you wanna ask what was wrong???.  Green Tea was over priced for just a tea bag!  There is no japanese sushi chef there, which I find most of Japanese restaurants in Charlotte have no Japanese chefs.  I am Japanese and I guess I just make/cook at home. Oh Miso Soup was good by the way."}
{"text":"My friends and I swung by Sushi 101 for a late dinner on Friday night and I opted for the noodle bowls instead of sushi and I was glad I did - I got the chicken combo, with the house Japanese style and the thick wheat noodles - it was incredible!  Everyone seemed very happy in my group and the service was excellent - my glass of water was never below half and our waitress was extremely attentive.  I will definitely be back and recommend it to anyone around the Park Road shopping center."}
{"text":"Shittiest service I have ever experienced. Had to repeat myself 5 times when there was no one here. Server never brought out silverware or asked if there was anything we needed.  Drink ran on empty the whole night. Sushi is gross and service is even worst. Stay far away from this restaurant and the only reason they are in service is the cheap prices for the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place.  I was pretty skeptical due to the name and location but don't let that deter you!  The sushi is fantastic and the prices are very reasonable.  Service is not over the top but they get the job done efficiently and with a smile.  I'll take that.  Drink specials are the best I've found in Charlotte.  $3 martinis on Monday and $1 beer on Tuesdays.  ONE. dollar.  Great spot for dinner or drinks after work on a long weekday."}
{"text":"Sever was okay. Wasn't as attentive as he should be as a server. Accidentally spilled our drink on the table, he walked passed many times by the table, saw the mess but didn't offer to even clean up the mess or asked if we needed any napkins.  Bad customer service. And the server would need to be coached on being better with 5 star customer service. Would not return as a customer."}
{"text":"Would give this 3.5 stars. Came for lunch. Food came out on-time, but not promptly. Good value. I got the sushi roll. Atmosphere lacking a bit, but it's a solid go-to place for decent Asian food."}
{"text":"The staff has always been really nice and helpful. Everytime I sit down the sushi chef Louis comes to greet me. The server took the time to offer suggestions of which sushi to try. Overall a fun and flavourful culinary adventure."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi and the staff is a lot of fun!  Good drink specials - especially Tuesday night!   $1 beers!!!   Cathy & Jen provide great service and the food is outstanding.  A must stop in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I always go to the Sushi 101 at the Promenade off Ballantyne Parkway on Friday or Saturday nights in the summer when there is live music. If you can't sit on their outdoor patio, get it to go, bring a blanket and have a picnic. I did however, come here on a Sunday night last week and found it super relaxing. It was a gorgeous night and it was very quiet. We sat on the patio and very much enjoyed an evening of good sushi. I was suprised to see they now have noodles on their menu. Maybe they've always had noodles and I've never seen them before. I ordered the ramen noodles with mushrooms and veggies in broth. It was very good however I felt the sodium level hours later when my body began to puff from the salt. I also ordered my favorite sushi rolls, the professor vu and the pandhandle. Both tasty as ever. Great chocie for cheap sushi."}
{"text":"After spending an evening at Snakes and Lattes, our group thought sushi sounded like a good follow-up plan so we headed to Sushi on Bloor.  Of course, as it was after 8 on a Saturday night, there was nearly an hour line.  Too hungry and cold to wait, and surrounded by sushi options, we figured another place would be just as good!  (I should point out here that only one in our party had ever been to Sushi on Bloor, so I can't compare the two).  I admit that walking in after being next door was a bit of a shock - there were a lot of empty tables.  Never a good sign.  But we took a seat nonetheless and perused the menu.  They have the standard options and a few specialties so we got a nice assortment.  This is the first time I've been served sushi as if they were separate courses - they came out one or two plates at a time.  I like being able to mix and match (kind of the point of ordering family style), so that was a downer.    The sushi itself wasn't bad, but definitely wasn't great.  They didn't commit the cardinal sin of making the pieces too big to eat gracefully in one bite (although that may just be my personal annoyance).  But it definitely wasn't anything special.    The service at the beginning wasn't terrible, the servers came by a few times to try to take our order since we were too busy chatting to make our selections.  They were also very good about refilling our waters - I don't think my glass was ever dry, and I drink a lot of water.    Then came the bill.  Or should I say, then came the bill situation since the bill was nowhere in sight.  At first we didn't realize because, again, we were deep in conversation.  Then we realized that we'd gone through two rather long stories since we'd finished our meals, and we hadn't seen a server yet.  It had been at least half an hour.  At that point we stood up to request the bills.  I should mention at this point that we were a table of two guys and two girls.  She only brought one bill.  Not that unexpected so I won't fault them too much on that, but we didn't have enough cash to split it ourselves.  Amongst ourselves, we decided that we would ask her to split the bill in two so that two of us could pay with credit cards.  She came back with the bill split in 4.  We didn't feel the need or desire to correct her at this point, so we just put two bills in each folder with our credit cards.  Again, it took about 15 minutes for her to return and take them, then we were finally out of there.    All in all, if you're not picky about your sushi and you want a place where you won't feel rushed on a Saturday night, this may be your place - but the quality is definitely low, as is the service."}
{"text":"You had me at $4.99 lunch special to celebrate your anniversary! It's been a couple years since my initial review and I have to say that this time around I have enjoyed the sushi. By no means is this my favorite sushi spot, but it satisfies and it's in a popular location.  They have great daily specials and generous portions...see my photo for the details.  Service is good and efficient; they get you in and out and back to work in no time."}
{"text":"I come here once a week for lunch. Food and service is always great. The server I had today was even more wonderful than usual.. Check out their lunch special too.   I should have written this review a long time ago!"}
{"text":"I can only judge off the lunch special because that's all I ever get. But I get it quite often...at least once per week. They have two different specialty rolls every day for like $8, and it always is enough to fill me up. Such a good deal."}
{"text":"Really good sushi place. Sushi is fresh, taste good, it will make. Services friendly, and quick.prices are a little high but not uncommon."}
{"text":"Hooray, sushi! My friends and I frequent here just about every Tuesday. It's kind of tradition. We enjoy an array of delicious selections from fried rice heaven to noodle bowl extravaganza to sushi superbedness! Nightly drink specials, awesome service from our favorite server joined with a fun lively atmosphere makes this Sushi 101 a great spot to get your grub on!"}
{"text":"Great Sushi, Great service, Awesome lunch special! I go there at least twice a week for their lunch special, best sushi deal in Ballantyne area. Bring the family in regularly for California Rolls, Endamame, Salmon Nigiri, etc. Try the \"Professor Vu\" roll, it's great."}
{"text":"The place has kind of a weird vibe, the place looks very nice with a large black bar type area and several high top tables. The art work that they have hanging up all around the place is a different story. The biggest piece is a painting of Gwen Stefani, not sure what she has to do with a sushi bar?  The food was pretty good, we had a couple of rolls and some noodles. Everything was very well prepaired and flavorful. The service on the other hand was sub-par. We ordered edimame as a appitizer; it did not come out until we were half way through our lunch. When they brought our food out, they had botched our order and brought out several items that we never ordered.   The food was good, but the overall experience was disappointing..."}
{"text":"Food was great! Service was a little off, might have been the waitresses first night. But overall great sushi! Haven't tried the Chinese or noodles yet but want to!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to eat at Sushi on Bloor but it was like 11:45 and they said I could only get take out. So, I decided to check this place out. The service was pretty good, and the food was pretty good the prices were decent, and they brought us separate bills without having to be asked. The lady was polite, I'm not sure what else I could really ask from the place that they didn't provide."}
{"text":"Went to Sushi 101 for lunch this past weekend.  The restaraunt was quiet, nearly empty, and the TVs were turned to the Panther's game.  Menu looked extensive, and featured many non-sushi items.   We ordered a few standard sushi rolls and a few of their specialty creations.    Overall, the food was fresh and as expected.  The staff was friendly. I was satisfied with the experience, but not wowwed.  That could be a result of the strip-mall location, lack of ambiance, or lack of authentic feel.  Regardless, the food was good and I'd go back for lunch or a quick/cheap sushi night.  However, for a date or special outing, Nikko would provide better ambiance."}
{"text":"What happened, Sushi 101? You used to be one of my favorites. The sushi list may not have been the longest, but the quality was always good. The noodle bowls were always humongous with plenty to take home for lunch the next day. And there used to be great drink specials to make the meal complete.   Unfortunately the noodle bowls have gotten noticeably smaller and the quality of the tempura has gone downhill. It is no longer full veggies - just chopped up pieces made into a semi-soggy log. The service was pleasant, but extremely slow. My water cup sat empty for a long time. The place needs a deep cleaning bad, too. The manager seemed to be parked at the end of the bar, never checking in on guests.   The sushi was ok - but there's a lot of competition now that make equally delicious rolls. The warm sake was at too high of a temperature. We had to move our food at one point so a waiter could take our drink menu, which didn't seem necessary.   Will wait a while before trying my former fav again."}
{"text":"Sushi 101 is hands-down my favorite sushi restaurant in Charlotte.   If I lived around the corner, I would probably eat here weekly.  As it is, I don't live around the corner, so I probably make it here about once a month.  The cuts of fish at Sushi 101 are large and thick while not costing an arm & leg. I'm certain I could go to some of the \"higher-end\" sushi restaurants in Charlotte and receive equally as good (or better?) slices of fish, but not at the price I can get at Sushi 101.  I don't feel like I'm sacrificing any quality, rather I feel like I'm getting a deal here.    I love to start my meal with the seaweed salad.  It's a generous portion, so often I will share it.  They have a large selection of $1 and $2 nigiri and plenty of specialty and classic rolls.   I usually choose a selection from the nigiri menu, but ask for it sashimi style - yay, no upcharge for this.  If I opt for a few rolls, I really like the Rock n' Roll - eel and avocado, and the Surf n' Turf - tempura shrimp and beef.    For beverages - on Monday you can get $3 glasses of house wine and Tuesday you can drink $1 domestic beer.  Seriously, $1 beer?  Is this college!?!  Yuengling sure tastes good to me at $1/bottle.  The servers are always friendly and attentive.  It can get busy, so we often go on \"off-times\"  - after 7:30 usually works well."}
{"text":"I really don't have much to say, the rolls are pretty average, the decor is modernistic and the service is friendly. But at $15 for what you get it's a bit expensive. For $5 less I can just drive down the road and go to Ru San's for a much bigger selection of lunchtime sushi and it also tastes a bit fresher there."}
{"text":"I love this place, my boyfriend and I probably go here once a month for dinner. We always sit at the bar (best service) and are helped right away. I would recommend the Sir Justin's Roll to someone who has never been here before and if you are looking for something light to start, the seaweed salad is delicious."}
{"text":"It would be *easy* for this place to be 3-star, and 4-star is reachable, but it isn't there, yet.  Sushi 101 is pretty new, but not so new as to excuse the long waits at every stage of service - water/tea often taking 10 minutes, lunch entrees sometimes taking 40 after that.  The execution is pretty sound if you stick to their strengths - decent maki, and a Korean section at the back of the menu with a pretty great Dol Sot Bibimbap. The prices are reasonable, too, and there's always plenty of space.  I want very much to recommend this place on the strength of the Bibimbap alone, but I can't send you, my yelpers, to a lunch spot that takes an hour to get you your food. If you end up stuck here anyhow, though, the good news is that the kitchen is decent.  PS - Avoid the mayo-tastrophes on the \"Chef's specials\" page except perhaps as novelty. They aren't exactly \"food.\""}
{"text":"Went to Sushi 101 last night as part of my quest to try all the sushi restaurants in Charlotte, and I gotta say that I won't be going back. I was expecting a lot more of a restaurant with such a good location right on the water and between the Hilton and FireWater, but I'm pretty sure this place just serves grocery-store quality sushi and you pay to look at the lake while you eat.   The restaurant itself was filthy (the floor looked like it hadn't been swept in weeks) and the decorating was your average dollar-store kitschy Asian junk. It was a little crowded when we arrived and we were seated at a small, very wobbly table in the middle of the restaurant. It seemed like they were wasting some space with the table arrangement, and the other side of the restaurant had big leather couches instead of chair...? Considering the general sloppiness of the place, I shudder to think about those couches. The menus were poorly designed laminated things and filthy, and the rolls were a little expensive ($9+ for maki, generally $3 more than other nearby places).  The sushi was unremarkable to outright unpleasant. We ordered the Crispy Bagel, the Ninja Roll, the Rainbow Roll, and one Kani nigiri. The rolls came out quickly and the server was sweet but not too professional (as we were leaving she was sitting at a nearby table with other servers gossiping loudly). The presentation of the rolls was sloppy and not even slightly elegant as sushi should be. The bagel roll was good but pretty much a standard bagel roll, except it had Japanese mayo on it instead of eel sauce, which was sort of unusual (and not in a good way). The rainbow roll was also your stock rainbow roll, nothing special. The ninja roll was room temperature even though it was supposedly a baked roll and it honestly tasted like the fish had gone bad; I only ate a few pieces before I couldn't stomach it, and later that evening I had some serious stomach issues that I'm attributing to this place. The crab salad handroll was very dry and tough, and there was no \"salad\" about it, it was just shredded crab. The rolls were loosely assembled so that they fell apart when you picked them up, the rice was dry, the sauce was scarce, and whatever brand of soy sauce they use is no good.   Maybe I just happened to visit this place on the absolute worst day, but I'm not willing to give them a second chance after this disappointment."}
{"text":"1pm lunch. Only a handful of tables were occupied.  Hostess was aloof.  Sat at the bar. After waiting 10 mins with no service, we decided to leave."}
{"text":"Great drink specials, pretty ok sushi....This is not what you expect with sushi is in the name of the restaurant.  I liked my tempura shrimp roll but experimented with 2 new ones named for places in Charlotte and was disappointed.  The calamari was yummy though!  Also the main dishes like shrimp with broccoli  and lo mein that other tables odered looked really good as well.  So moral of the story ...be careful about what kind of sushi you order at sushi 101?"}
{"text":"Great value for lunch. Friendly staff, fresh tasting food every time."}
{"text":"I happened to be nearby and thought I'd drop in and try their sushi. I've been on the hunt for some good sushi for the past few years here in Charlotte, so when I'm out and about, I try to stop and get a roll or two. I ordered the Shrimp Tempura Roll ($6.95), since it is one of the easiest to make and hardest to screw up. It was ready within 5 minutes and still a little warm. The shrimp was minimal, unbranded and nothing to write home about. Although it didn't have much flavor, I will say it was fresh. The side of pickled ginger and wasabi was fresh also. I may be spoiled concerning good sushi because I'm partial to WNY restaurants and cooking. I probably wouldn't go back to Sushi 101, but I don't have any significant complaints. The Tempura roll was just \"ok\", you know ... palatable, uninteresting. To give you a gauge, I've also tried \"Pisces\" Sushi Uptown, and I didn't think theirs was spectacular either. Charlotte could sure use some GOOD restaurants ... I'm just saying. Oh yea, the atmosphere at Sushi 101 is delightful, kinda casual cool. As you walk inside the restaurant, you are greeted by the friendly staff and the Bar to the right. The dimmed Japanese lighting gives this place a nice warm atmosphere. If you're not a sushi connoisseur, you'll probably enjoy a quick lunch here, but don't expect any jaw dropping surprise of great sushi. Back on the hunt !"}
{"text":"This is my fiance and I's favorite sushi place here in Charlotte.  We have been coming here every couple months or so for the last three(ish) years and we love it every time.  I try to order a different roll every time I come and have become quite adventurous with my sushi since I first started coming here.  I found that I really like eel and the octopus isn't half bad (I think it's only in sashimi though).  I have not ever been disappointed in an order of sushi from this place and will continue to go out of my way (we live in Mint Hill) to come here every so often when the sushi mood hits us."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always my go to. Service is great and food is consistent. People remember your name. Great place to take a date also!"}
{"text":"This definitely my favorite sushi spot in Charlotte...either the one on Park or the location down off Providence and 485.  Good selection, well priced and they do have Chimay...Chimay is king.  Wait staff is almost always very friendly and fast...sushi chefs are hilarious, so when you get the chance...sit at the sushi bar and strike up a little conversation with them.  Also...and I'm sorry for even bringing this up...but they have some unreasonably good fried ice cream!!!  Then again, how can fried ice cream be bad...anyway, check that out."}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer of this place. The atmosphere is very quiet and relaxing. It is a casual dining experience so nothing fancy, just good food! Allison is the best she will go the extra mile to make sure you get what you want! Good place for a caual date night."}
{"text":"As a grad student with limited funds, I really appreciate the Sushi 101 deals.  Specifically, the $2 martini nights.  I thought the sushi was good.  It didn't blow me away but I was by no means disappointed.  I tried a specialty roll which ran about 11 bucks (I apologize I can't recall the name) and a regular spicy tuna (about 5 bucks).  I ate both rolls happily. That being said, there is really only one reason I would go back to sushi 101 - the drink specials they offer!  You can get decent sushi with a super cheap bar tab.  Tip: go to the website prior to heading to the restaurant.  This way you can select the night that has the most appealing drink deals for you and your friends!"}
{"text":"It's great basic sushi place.  I've been close to 20 times over several years.  My biggest complaint is that it can be a bit inconsistent.  Sometimes the fish is fresher than others.  Cooked items may be over cooked sometimes.  You have to try the tuna maki 101.  Spring roles are great too."}
{"text":"Love the dark bar look of this sushi place, among other things ;). They are consistent with the quality of food and service. Lunch time is usually hectic and it can sometimes take long. The staff is so helpful and know their menu. They have great, fresh sushi and reasonable prices.   Try the edamame, seaweed salad and the Professor Vu."}
{"text":"Went to this place with my best friend sometime last week. We were starving so anything good would have tasted great. Instead, the chicken teriyaki we had was simply the worst I've had in my life. Rubbery chicken, and the teriyaki sauce was just disgusting. I didn't try the sushi but I saw plenty of people eating it and not looking as disappointed as we were. I will like to say I will try this place again but it was not cheap and so so bad that no,I can't give it a second chance."}
{"text":"Terrible service for overpriced moderate quality sushi in a roach infested strip mall. Skip this and head down to New Zealand cafe for something much better.  See my photo of the roach in the biz photos."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Have been coming here for years! Food is always so delicious and service is always great. Try the Lava roll or their chicken fried rice. Ask for Daniel as a waiter, he's awesome. Doesn't get better than this!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. I just tossed my entire order in the trash. They cut my sashimi into CUBES?!?! Unreal."}
{"text":"a lil pricey I think, but i'm poor. good enough to fix a craving for sushi but...  It's like i'm saying, ya overstand?  I thought you would.  I dig it but it's kind of an underdigging experience.  Like sex on GHB, im sure its good but i dont really remember."}
{"text":"I love the service here. Sunday night, mostly every place closes at 10 unless it's a gross chain restaurant. I knew they'd be open so I called to make a to go order. I lost my debit card at home and completely blanked out when I tried giving them my card's numbers over the phone. The employee was polite and patient. Numbers weren't right so I decided to ask my father to give me the numbers to his and came in to the restaurant. The woman at the bar who I see every time I am there was great! Very kind too! Offered me a water while I wait for my to go order and talked to me as well. This place never disappoints. Good food AND good service is hard to come by."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and good location, right by Montford.  I would however, like some more options in terms of rolls that do not have typical American ingredients like cream cheese.  I thought the generic rolls were a tad on the expensive side.  But a good place to meet up with a group and share appetizers"}
{"text":"First I have to start off by saying I can't believe I have been in charlotte for almost eight years and today marks my first time venturing out to sushi 101, as I have heard so many things about this place but never seemed to find myself nearby when I needed my regular sushi fix (which is pretty much any day ending in the letter y), but all that changed today.  I ordered the panhandle roll, the jasmine roll and the voodoo roll and hold on, I seriously don't want to put my chopsticks down to type because these three rolls are absolutely AMAZING!  The individual flavors mesh so well together and the freshness of the ingredients is clearly evident with each bite.  I love spicy and the server did not disappoint with her recommendation as these are some of the most flavorful rolls I have ever tasted, and that my friends is not hyperbole or exaggeration!  I also have to give my server Megan special recognition as my water glass never got less than half full before she refilled it with a smile every time.  She was extremely personable and actually genuinely appeared to enjoy being there, which sad to say isn't always the case with servers in some places as I am sure we can all attest to!  First class service with a smile + fresh flavorful sushi at a solid value = the next entrant into my five star club!   Congratulations sushi 101 as it is well deserved and I will definitely be back again and again and again!"}
{"text":"LOVE their \"anniversary lunch special\".  We've gone over and over again for the $4.99 for two rolls!!  We called today to see if they were still doing it - as it's been going on for the last 4 months - and they said that it was \"last month's special\".  The sushi was very good, very basic rolls.  They started using asparagus in everything, I love it, the boyfriend doesn't so much.  We've been going about once a week for that amazing lunch special.  Probably won't visit that frequently now, so... Here's to hoping that the lunch special returns!!"}
{"text":"Average sushi. I could not tell anything special about the flavor. Spicy tuna roll was not really spicy. Rest tasted kinda bland which Include dragon roll and spider roll. Though not bad place but I expected more for the price."}
{"text":"So unfortunate, I would come grab lunch here on a pretty regular basis and sometimes with co-workers. Today, I came in with two other coworkers and after sitting down and waiting a while we finally were greeted and had our drink orders taken. Then we ordered our food. Nothing too big, two specials and some sushi. We waited and waited and waited. Then after 45 minutes were said, okay we will be pushing time since we were on lunch breaks, so could we have the checks when our food came. Then it turned into, okay can we get the food in to go boxes. Still waiting, nothing. The server brought checks to pay, still no food. Finally I asked to just cancel my order and void my transaction. Another server had to come to void this and came to the table with an attitude. Our original server told us there was one sushi chef there and she really wasn't an actual sushi chef and our delay was because of the table next to us ordering their food. I explained their staffing problem was  not our issue. So when the other server came over to bring me my voided receipt copy, she said they didn't have any staff, and my coworker said that would have been nice to know when we walked in, we could have decided whether or not to stay. Her response was that she was not our server and she would have told us, even though she was the one who sat us. During this whole process the owner was behind the counter and I did not see him assisting with anything. The second server asked my coworkers if they wanted their food and they said yes, since number one it was paid and they were hungry. Then she continued to have an attitude about the whole deal and said but I will refund your money if you want. It was all so unnecessary and disappointing. I have been a customer of this location for a long time, but after this experience I am not interested in spending any money with people who aren't the least bit concerned about keeping their customers happy."}
{"text":"I actually like Sushi 101, despite it's mediocre Yelp rating, and despite the fact that I myself am only giving it three stars.  It's a semi-regular lunch spot for my co-workers and me.  The food is good; it is pricey, but they usually have a decent special, and that's what I have gotten each time so far.  Last time the special was a fried California roll and a smoked salmon and cream cheese roll.  I didn't realize that the California roll was fried when I ordered it, and I thought I would be disappointed, since I usually dislike fried rolls.  However, the fry job this time was very light, so it wasn't too bad.  The service robs Sushi 101 of it's fourth star, for me at least.  It's generally slow, and while usually polite, can sometimes be snarky."}
{"text":"When the restaurant up the street didn't have sushi service at lunch, my friend and I popped in here. The sushi was good, but keep in mind that they are very, very serious about closing between lunch and dinner. They made us to-go boxes, and we sat outside- nice day! I thought the rolls were a good size, a bit low on fish, but fine for the price. I had a salmon roll and spicy tuna."}
{"text":"Quality sushi and not overly expensive. I love the calamari, ahi poke, tuna and avocado roll, surf and turf roll, and volcano roll. The bartenders are also awesome. Try a sake-tini!"}
{"text":"The Chicken fried rice is excellent! 1$ domestic beers on Tuesday!? You can't beat it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for decent sushi without dressing up or going casual to pick up without the breaking the bank you found the right place. Interior is blah and looks like they spent no money, just the basics. Waitstaff is mediocre and you are constantly have to flag them down if you need a refill or are thirsty. This is just average sushi, nothing fancy. It tastes fine."}
{"text":"The sashimi was ok. The rolls were done in a hurry and you could tell. Overall for the area the place was decent. I've never seen Sriracha sauce in every table in a sushi restaurant before. Go figure..."}
{"text":"I pretty much come here for one thing. Udon noodle soup. My friends have tried and liked other things on the menu. But for me, it's the Udon noodles. It is hard to find a place that does the thick buckwheat noodles in a robust broth with meats and veggies. I am typically not a soup guy because a I rarely get satiated. This soup fills me past comfort levels at times. With the weather getting cold, I am glad this place is a 3 min drive away."}
{"text":"Came in at lunch time to order to-go. The lady that served me was great and quickly submitted my order. The disappointment arrived once I came home, the sushi quality was something I would find in a grocery store or food court. I won't be back and I'll be going back to my regular sushi place Ru Sans."}
{"text":"We came here for a late lunch on a rainy Sunday. We've lived down the street for almost 2 years and kept forgetting to try this place. Our waitress was energetic and sweet. We ordered 3 rolls and a hot dish. The sushi was excellent, and the hot plate was fresh. The portion sizes were huge! I will definitely be back, we had a great meal here and had tons of leftovers for lunch the next time. Great little place."}
{"text":"Sushi is fair, nothing special. Service is hit or miss. I've been at night and had good service, then I went for lunch yesterday and the guy was so smug, and unfriendly. It's really nothing special."}
{"text":"Foods were mediocre and the server just made it worse.. His laid back attitude just made the whole experience poor. I will not come back."}
{"text":"I go their Udon Yaki Shrimp Noodle bowl and it was as good as the first time I came here.  I highly recommend their noodle bowls.  The shrimp was nicely grilled to perfection...not too charred and not too soft.  The sauce they used was really good and I like how the bowls come with a good amount of veggies.  My boyfriend had the ramen noodles and I have to say, I might have liked those noodles better, which is unusual for me because I love the thicker noodles!  I will be coming back to this place more often!"}
{"text":"Felt like this needed an update: Sushi here is just meh, not super fresh, but I've had worse. They have some soup noodle entrees that I haven't found at any other restaurants in Charlotte which will probably be the only reason I come back. (That and they're open pretty late, which is great if I have a random craving and don't want to drive) Service was friendly and atmosphere fun."}
{"text":"The review is solely on their cajun edamame, the sushi is just ok!"}
{"text":"I've been a frequent customer here for about 3 years now.  It's somewhat close to my home and I, until this past weekend, have had a decent experience both dining in and carrying out.  Orders are usually accurate and the food, again is decent.  Unfortunately, my opinion was changed on Saturday.  I placed a to-go order as I have done many times in the past and picked it up promptly.  The service was quick, as usual, which I appreciate.  I grabbed the tied up bag and headed home.  When I arrived, I opened up my package and realized half of my order was completely incorrect.  Realizing it was an error, accidents and mistakes happen... I called the restaurant to see if they would be kind enough help rectify the situation.  I asked to take the portion of food that was incorrect off of my bill since after reviewing what had happened with the server, it was deemed the kitchen staff's mistake. I was told that was not possible.  They would rather I come exchange the incorrect portion of the order for the correct items or tell my server the next time I'm in the restaurant about this incident so they could give me a credit on my next bill.  First, it was not convenient to drive back to the restaurant as I was about to sit down to dinner with family. Secondly I don't eat what I was given by mistake. Third, assuming I was to come back to the restaurant again for another visit after being treated somewhat rudely, how was my server supposed to know all of this occurred and my \"credit request\" was legit should the owner not be present? I asked very politely to be refunded for the portion of my dinner that was incorrect and call it a day, to which I was balked at by the owner and told he could not refund the money.  Now, I'm by no means a cheap skate especially when it comes to food and I have worked in the restaurant industry in previous years, but to be rude and unwavering about helping a repeat customer in this way left a bad taste in my mouth so to speak.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Why is the table sticky? And why are they closed for lunch they said except for a take out? Then customers are sitting inside? Is this a special group? Watched the sushi \"master\" did they learn from a infomercial?   ... Perfect location for a Sushi place if this was one..   One question \"Sushi\" 101   why did you cook the seaweed with bacon grease? Have you been watching the ex queen paula deen? I feel sick.."}
{"text":"No. This establishment left me unfulfilled.  Dry Sushi and inept service. Loud enviorment and uninspired decor. Impossible parking, plus I think the need to repeat Sushi 101. Maybe it would not crumble in my hand."}
{"text":"I thought it was a bit odd for another sushi place to open up right next door to Sushi On Bloor, but then quickly clued in that 101 Sushi was anticipating on being the place people settle for when there's a line-up at its neighbouring competition. Sure enough my first time at 101 is when I didn't feel like waiting for a table at the superior Sushi On Bloor, and assumed that all sushi is relatively the same anyway.  The place lacked a little in the decor, but they have these really nice and high booths that are quite comfortable. The menu also had a nice pattern on it so I thought maybe things were looking good. Waitress was kind, but then realised it was only here and one chef working. And people starting pouring in behind us...  Things were a tad slower than I am used to at sushi places, but this was clearly from the lack of staff. Food and prices seemed both fair to me, but I didn't think the rolls were quite as good as SOB or most places I frequent. I was full and satisfied after my meal so I can't complain too much... Though it's unlikely this will ever be my first choice for sushi in the Annex."}
{"text":"The fish they use is incredibly fresh and consistently delicious. Their Tokyo Rose gives me life.   I have not ONCE had an issue with this restaurant and I have been visiting for almost a decade.   AMAZING food, friendly service, great prices"}
{"text":"I would definitely give this place 5 stars if the decor was sexier.  Located in the same complex as one of my favorite places (Total Wine and More!!!) it is easy to find off Park and Woodlawn.  There is lot parking and the store-front is very small.  Once you get inside tho you see it is a long restaurant and also has a long bar.    The food here is unreal!!!  Not at all what this snob expected from the decor.  The tuna appetizer recommended by our great and friendly waitress was DIVINE.  I still have dreams about it.  It was tuna marinated in a sauce and served with crispy rice cake type things,  So fantastic we ate every drop.  Honestly this could have been my dinner maybe with some soup.  We will be back just for this app.    But also the dinner rolls were awesome - I can't remember which I got but the sushi was fresh and delicious.  Service excellent and on Tuesdays they have $1 domestic beer - YAHOO!!!"}
{"text":"Consistency means a lot to me and the fam.   It's not just the food (well, it's obviously important) but the service, atmosphere etc., and this location constantly exceeds on many points.  Our latest outting we ordered the softcrab roll and fried rice and they were both excellent (5/5) and the service was fantastic (5/5).  When we received our bill the owner gave us a pleasant surprise and that just reinforced our support of this location.   He said he recognized us as we frequent his restaurant and appreciated my reviews on Yelp.  Great sushi and service done consistently!!"}
{"text":"Meh! Our 4 rolls tasted like something you get from Harris Teeter after its been sitting out for a while."}
{"text":"Sushi 101 used to be a reliable spot for quick, Americanized Japanese fare but it has gone off the rails. Stopped by for a quick dinner at the bar at 8:15 - fried gyoza, fried rice and a beer. Three of the gyoza were burned, not charred, not smoky. Burned and should not have been served. I would have complained rice the bartender but she was no where to be found. Fried rice came out quickly but it was loaded with big pieces of green pepper. The flavor was overwhelming... The beef was well done and chewy. It was also heavy seasoned with a lot of black pepper. No one checked on me to see if the food was prepared well... I ate what I wanted then at 8:40 I sent a text to getting saying, \"Going to ask for my check and head your way.\" No one ever checked on me, I was the only person at the bar and the bartender apparently left. At 9:05 a man came in from outside and looked like he worked there. I asked if he could close me out. He said sure, then he asked another waitress to close me out. She printed out the ticket, I have get a card then she made another customer a drink before closing me out. The cooking and the service were both unacceptable and I will be avoiding Sushi 101 until I see a lot of good reviews coming in during off-peak hours."}
{"text":"We really enjoy their pork gyoza steamed they are so good.  I always enjoy their udon noodles with grilled shrimp. The One thing that annoys me though is their pops/sodas are in cans and they charge per can no refills."}
{"text":"Favorite Sushi place.. the food here is tasty and their aioli sauce makes the dish! Ordering take out here is quick and easy.. food is always hot and ready to go just the way it would be if you were eating in. Yum!"}
{"text":"Sushi is good, but if you're not a fried or tempura fan you might find the selection limiting.  I prefer New Zealand and 18 Asian menus to this one."}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets 2 stars is because the very first time I went there, the sashimi was the best I'd ever had. I've been twice since then and last night was the last straw. My guess is that they've changed management or ownership. The hostess wiped down the table in front of us by spraying the cleaning solution on the table, without even bothering to move the soy sauce and sriracha bottles out of the way. When she seated us, the table was sopping wet and still very sticky.   Then came the food. It was a group of five of us and among the orders were yaki somen with grilled shrimp, three sashimi platters, a combination sushi platter, and a bowl of chirashi. After waiting 30 minutes for our food, the noodles were the highlight of the meal. The sashimi was warm (as usual), and the chirashi was the saddest I've ever seen. It was a gigantic bowl of rice with nine measley slices of warm fish and three slices of cucumbers. I'm a huge fan of chirashi and try to order it at every sushi restaurant I go to, in order to find the best. This was the worst.   A simple tip to them: close the doors to the sushi refrigerators after you've taken out the portion you need. Doing this one simple thing will keep your fish much colder. Or serve it over ice. Although, serving it over ice would probably result in the fish swimming in a pool of water by the time it got to the customers, since they are so slow."}
{"text":"I was in the Ballantyne area so I stopped in here tonight based on the recommendations of my fellow yelpers.   I was surprised at the quality of the food in this restaurant for being a strip center restaurant.   I walked in the service was quick they offered me a full drink menu I ordered hot sake and immediately ordered a number of fresh sushi off the alla Carte menu.  I also ordered a noodle bowl using the udon noodles and grilled shrimp.  The food was outstanding and the flavors were better. The udon noodles with the broth was some of the best I've had throughout the country.    If you were in this area and you were looking for fresh sushi and good Japanese cuisine I would highly recommend stopping at this facility."}
{"text":"Wow, this place really hits on all cylinders!  Not only are the rolls fresh and creative they won't break the bank!  Not overly done with a bad ratio of rice to fish like some places, Sushi 101 really knows how to roll :)  I had a coupon for dinner and I've eaten lunch here a few times so I can realistically say I've never had a bad experience here.  The service is always prompt and polite and the drink specials always treat me right also.    Don't come here looking for insane, ecclectic interiors or a decor that is going to blow your socks off.  It's a simple place and it's simply delicious.  Look online on their site for a coupon or two and pay attention to those drink specials.  $1 bottled domestics is pretty good if I do say so myself."}
{"text":"So I love sushi 101 but for noodle bowls, their miso soup(best in Charlotte), their amazing tempura broccoli, and great fried rice. They have these little $3 yaki's that you can have grilled tempura or teriyaki and they are so yummy. ( I recommend salmon teriyaki style)  They don't take the gold for sushi rolls, their fish quality can be hit or miss.   (Sushi guru takes the prize for sushi rolls, and bricktops sushi is delicious and fresh.)  But back to sushi 101, They always have drink specials, Allison at the bar is the best. She has a wonderful personality, always gets your order right and provides excellent service.  They are reasonably priced and have lots of options for even the pickiest eater. Or non sushi eater.  It's quaint and conveniently located.  They recently painted and finally got rid of the orange sponge painted walls  so it looks nice   Give it a try for lunch dinner or late night! Ok, now I want a noodle bowl lol"}
{"text":"First time here , popped in for a quick lunch, amazingly fresh, great menu, fast and friendly I will be back with my honey.    (:"}
{"text":"Been several times, a definite favorite for me and friends to hit up when we are craving sushi.  Their ginger dressing is delicious and the sushi is always great.  This past time I went with my girlfriends and I ordered the Sir Justin Roll (fantastic tuna on top) and the Dynamite roll....if you love anything spicy, this is your roll!!!  The nigri is wonderful-very fresh (love the tuna and salmon) and they have giant Sapparos for a pretty decent price. *And of course, great service!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch 1pm Sunday. Place was fairly busy. One of the staff pointed us to a table. We sat and waited. We saw 2 people trying to handle the whole place. At one point we did not see any staff for a while.  We were patient, had to ask for menus and again waited figuring the waitress was getting caught up since she just dropped checks at 3 tables. If we were just acknowledged or gotten drinks we could understand. We finally gave up, stood up and left.  Funny part was on the way out another couple was coming in and saw what was going on. They asked us if they should try, we told them good luck and they decided to leave as well  They lost 2 tables of customers thru poor service."}
{"text":"This place is just sad.  When I've had better tasting sashimi at whole foods for a fraction of the price, you should throw in the towel and simply walk away.  Sub par can't even begin to accurately describe this place.  Maybe they simply forget the decimal in front of 101?  Next....."}
{"text":"What a great place!  My family and I check Yelp before we go to any restaurant.  We almost did not go to this place since it only had slightly more than 3 stars.  We were glad we went in.  We have been back 2 more times since our first visit.  Food has always been very good and service is great.  I'm not sure if things have improved, but we pretty much have this place locked down as one of our go to places when we are trying to decide where to eat.  Fixed Tempura noodle bowl is great and the sushi was creative and delicious."}
{"text":"My daughter enjoys Sushi 101; however, since the kid prefers things basic & flavorless, that's not exactly a glowing endorsement.  They do have some good appetizers and the yakitori is good (albeit a bit expensive at $2/ea).  Unfortunately, for a place named Sushi 101, their sushi is inconsistent at best.  Generally, if I order sushi here, it is very sloppy, showing inconsistent and uneven knife skills.  The fish is just OK and a lot of the sushi makes up for poor basics by adding flashy ingredients that detract from the dish."}
{"text":"Checked into this place with a BOGO coupon (thanks Citipass!) for lunch one day with the beau and to my shock and happiness, everything was pretty good! Our server was a little lacking, but the sushi rolls we partook in (Cali, Philly, Rock&Roll) were fresh, huge and rolled really well.  I had the chicken hibachi and the manpiece had the salmon. We were shocked at how much food was on the plate (it's good warmed up, true story!) and really pleased with the taste and quality. The salmon is definitely worth having each time you go - it's got a glaze that is spot on!  The bill came to $40 after coupon and with so much food, that's totally cool in my book. Not a quick, cheap lunch place but a really nice place to pop into after exploring the shops in The Promenade!"}
{"text":"When I first moved here this place was great and had large rolls. The last time I went though it has changed alot and I would not recommend it to people looking for good sushi in town. The rolls have became really small and prices are not in line either."}
{"text":"Love the food, atmosphere, and staff.  Cindy and Nina are the best!  The noodle bowls and the gyoza app are my favs.  The the professor roll is lit I hear.  It's a must try in south clt. The drink specials are a good reason to stop, but the food and service is why you stay!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi place in an unexpected strip mall! I always seem to overlook this little spot, but it has some really good items on the menu! Their tuna tartare is actually one of my favorites here in Charlotte, and the Professor Vu roll is solid. Also, there's these little fried balls of goodness on the app menu...so tasty! I love that we can stop here for a quick dinner with our 2 year old, get good sushi and good service."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO AFTER 2:15! So I walk in at 2:20 (thinking I could get something to go) realizing they close at 2:30 & reopen at 4:30. Stood by the hostess stand for about 3 minutes,   noticed 3 other patrons finishing their meals.  A young lady came up & said \"We're closed.\" I looked at my watch & it did show 2:20. Young lady then stated \"We close at 2:30 & we stop seating at 2:15.\" I was not offered take out, but was told they were closed. I would have understood had she not be SO RUDE &/or offered take out; afterall, I just wanted a tuna roll."}
{"text":"Still love this place!  I must say the Passion roll and the Panhandle roll are my current favorites.  The Dancing eel is really good too.  We will continue coming back!"}
{"text":"Before our valiant return to Sushi 101 last week, it must have been at least 5-years since my last visit. Oddly enough, not much has changed. They're still doing decent sushi at a decent price. Can you find better sushi in Charlotte? Absolutely! Can you find cheaper sushi in Charlotte. Eh, probably. (Mr. Tokyo and your beautiful AYCE menu, I'm looking at you!)   We started with the gyoza which was the low point of the evening. I think they were microwaved. Pretty flavorless and super greasy. Luckily, the sushi redeemed the place. We ordered the tempura vegetable maki and it brought back all kinds of memories. I got my sushi training wheels at this place -- scared of real fish, I started with the vegetable rolls and spicy chicken katsu maki when I was in college and felt peer pressured to like sushi. The roll tasted exactly as I remembered it! We also had the Sir Justin roll, topped with delicious poke and sashimi sampler. This girl isn't afraid of raw fish anymore!   Service was attentive, bordering on rushed. The decor hasn't changed in years, which makes the restaurant feel a little dated. All in all, not an awful spot and I'd stop in again if I found myself craving sushi while near Park Road. But, I certainly wouldn't make a special trip just for Sushi 101. I'd pass way too many other great sushi spots (Koishi, Namastay, Sushi Guru, Baku, etc.) along the way!"}
{"text":"One of my biggest complaints when I moved to Charlotte was the sushi situation. I mean, deep fried sushi? What the heck? I'm no purist, because I do love to experiment and try new flavors. But dropping a roll of perfectly-rolled sushi into a deep fryer is blasphemy, in my opinion. So... for this reason, I was hesitant to try Sushi 101 because I feared it would be another trendy sushi spot (I avoided any place with deep friend sushi for that reason). Anyway, our usual sushi spot was going through some management changes and the menu changed, so we had to branch out and try new places.   My family is pretty predictable. The 9-year old boy loves ramen noodle soup with chicken and no veggies. The hubby loves sushi and ramen noodle soup with all the veggies they can fit in the bowl. I skip the soup and just eat sashimi and maybe a hand roll or two, a ginger salad or some edamame.  We found Sushi 101 to be a really pleasant surprise! As you can imagine, we skipped the deep fried sushi (and now, I will step off the soap box)...  Their noodle dishes are wonderful. I love how you basically build your dish. Pick your starch (noodle choices include udon, buckwheat, glass noodles and ramen... or rice), then your protein, then your \"style\". They can make it into soup, a stir-fry or even a \"don\" style which is over rice. LOVE this format!  The sushi menu is extensive and satisfying to any sushi lover. For the purists, you can get a lovely sashimi. The fish is fresh and expertly prepared. Their presentation, even for the simplest of items, is lovely. The nigiri sushi rolls are great, and the portions are great for one, or to share (if you order a few). My only complaint is that there's just a little too much rice on the nigiri, but that's no biggie. I am in love with their Half Moon, which is a lightly broiled scallop concoction, it just melts in your mouth and leaves you begging for more!  They do have a full bar, wine list (not extensive), sake and Japanese and domestic beers. The sodas are served in cans, which I've always found to be a little strange, but, again, no biggie. Just different.  All in all, we love the service, the location and the menu. The food never disappoints, and this is now one of our regular sushi spots. It's best at lunch time, because you can get in and out in less than 45 mins!"}
{"text":"The name fits the place perfectly. It's extremely basic hence the \"101\" in it's name. For those of you who love sushi you know spicy tuna is a staple in the sushi game. This place does not have one item on the table. Sushi, was somewhat fresh but again really basic. To give them some credit I would place them in the top 100 sushi restaurants in the Ballantyne Commons area."}
{"text":"Service a little slow, but love the lettuce wraps!! The fried California roll is a delight! It is a warm, creamy sushi. I love the spider roll too! The voo doo roll is Very spicy!!! It is a tiny little place, decor is blah. But love the food! It is a nice place to have lunch and socialize. There is nice seating ourside where I saw several people with their dogs, a few doors down has water bowls for dogs."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi in Charlotte but still really really good for the money.   Huge selection of rolls.   This was our first  time in several yrs but we like great sushi on a budget. So we will be back."}
{"text":"Always a fan of sushi, but the Sunday crew could have been the \"B\" team that we experienced.  Even though it was a Sunday (early) around 5 or 6pm, we waited for a table and service was super slow.  Good thing we had the time to kill and our server was nice enough.  There was some confusion of how to split the check and she seemed to take forever with sliding our plastic forms of payment....  (only because she was correcting the splitting of the checks which was nice).  Overall, it's a solid place to get sushi if you are in the area.  I would not go out of my way to go to this Sushi 101.  It's a bit tight with the receiving area right when you open the door - makes it a little awkward if you are waiting for a table.  Personally I am a fan of the life-sized portrait of Gwen Stafani in the Sushi101 off of Park Rd and Woodlawn... but this one has some local art and R2D2 on the walls.  Parking can get a bit crazy since the traffic flow around the restaurant is rather odd and the spaces are angled.  A big plus is that Yoforia is right next door so it makes for a short stroll for dessert."}
{"text":"Great place.  Used to come here a lot when I had friends that lived close by and we'd do sushi nights.  For some reason we always get the table located right underneath the rather large painting of Gwen Stafani.  It's become tradition and we always get bummed if someone else is sitting underneath it when we arrive.  Sushi is always made well and the staff keeps your glasses filled and always seem to have a smile.  Edamame is always a great starter to munch on while deciding what kind of rolls or maki you are going to get."}
{"text":"This place has been on my bucket list for a while but it was actually a 2nd choice for dinner after my dinner group's initial plans for the night got derailed. But this was a great alternative.  First off, I never knew how big the restaurant is. From the front it looks tiny but the space actually goes back quite a bit and there's plenty of seating at the bar and at tables.    The dinner group started out sharing a bunch of appetizers...edemame, cajun shrimp, spring rolls, and tempura shrimp. Of those the cajun shrimp seemed to be the favorite.  For an entree, I had the Sushi combo which while it lacked in overall presentation, the flavors were good and you only needed a little wasabi to clear your sinuses.  The only complaint I have is that the service was inconsistent. 3 of our appetizers arrived at the same time and one arrived 15 minutes later. And since we were seated in the back of the restaurant it almost seemed like we were forgotten about at first but service seemed to pick up later in our meal.    I'd give this 3.75 stars but not quite worthy of the 4."}
{"text":"Good noodles.  Average to poor sushi.  Sushi was mostly rice, small and not too much flavor."}
{"text":"We love their sushi selection. While the take out is good, eating here is great. Service is good along with an awesome drink selection with fun specials like interesting takes on sangria and mojitos.  Try their non sushi items too, like ramen and chicken fried rice."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place and I wouldn't even call myself an avid sushi lover. Although I like it, it's not my favorite food on the planet, (that would be my wife, she could eat sushi every day for life) but sushi 101 is incredible. I've never had a bad experience here. The sushi is DELICIOUS and I'd say it's fairly priced as far as sushi goes. On our last trip I ordered the Super Crunch Roll- one of my faves and one of my \"usuals\" and the Ballantyne roll. I expected the SCR to be great, and it was, but that Ballantyne was to die for. It has crunchy salmon skin on the inside of the roll and raw salmon on top. (Ugh, wish I'd gotten a pic of it) it was absolutely delicious and it might become a new favorite of mine.  We went with a large group of friends and everyone enjoyed their meals and the service was pleasant and fast. Oh, the edamame as an appetizer is a MUST! It comes out warm and flavorful and we couldn't stop eating it.  My father in law ordered the chicken fried rice (I don't think he's a sushi fan lol) and they brought him this massiveeeee plate out of the most delicious rice ever, he was in heaven! The other thing about Sushi101 is that they're right next to Polkadots bake shop, one of the finest cupcakeries in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I guess I am on a sushi kick.   This place is pretty close to my house, so I thought I would give it a try. I got the crispy bagel roll and the super crunch roll. Both were pretty delish, I was kinda disappointed in the rolling job. They weren't rolled as tight as I am used to, which makes for hard maneuvering into the mouth.   I'd give them 4 stars if it wasn't for the poor rolling job. I'd definitely go back again, because it was a very yummy experience!   I had take out, so I can't comment on the waiter service or atmosphere, but the girl that took my order over the phone was very pleasant!"}
{"text":":( I used to like going to this place, today's experience was not good, the food not only took forever to arrive it was blah on taste, I'm almost certain there was hair in my appetizer. It just didn't seem to be he same service and food quality as before. I'm not sure I will go back."}
{"text":"Went to Sushi 101 for lunch with the co-workers. Overall I thought it was just a-ok.   I had the Professor Vu Roll which is shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado, tuna, crab salad, and scallions for $11.95  The roll was a bit pricey for the caliber(and amount) of the food (in my opinion). I like the crab salad a lot but nothing really stood out flavor-wise. For $12 Ive had much better rolls at Press and Soul.   I tried a piece of my co-workers California roll which seemed mushy. Also tried the veggie tempura. The tempura looked fabulous but seriously lacked flavor. Also tried a rock & roll - which was alright, although I am not a huge eel person so maybe I am biased.   My total lunch was about $15 - including tip ...I feel like I have had much better lunches at that price point.  I would give it another try though...maybe they'll wow me the second time around."}
{"text":"I cant say enough about the service and the wonderful people that work here. Unbelievable atmosphere and just an overall fantastic and pleasurable experience."}
{"text":"I am officially disgusted with this place. This is not the first time I've had a bad experience. But the sushi is usually good, and it's so close to my house how can I complain. But tonight the manager was so offputting I literally wanted to lose my mind. After spending 14 minutes on hold I decided to drive over to the restaurant which is only two minutes from my apartment. I kept the phone on hold to show the manager. She acted as if I was being inconsiderate for even complaining when they only had two people sitting at one table in the entire restaurant and there was absolutely nothing going on. She was completely rude and unconcerned with the issue at hand. What was even more off putting is that when I mentioned I was also in the restaurant business and was appalled by her behavior, she only seemed to be more done with the conversation. As someone who works in customer service I was left speechless. I could not be more thankful for Ru San's for turning my night around. I had to drive a little further but it was completely worth it. They were slammed but answered my call immediately, took my order and had it ready in 10 minutes. Even though they were super busy when I went inside they were insanely nice and I could not have had a better experience. To the staff members of sushi 101, it seems as if you all think you are better than the job you are working. I think you all need a kick in the ass from life and a little perspective. Shame on you for giving a bad name to restaurants in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"I used to think this place was pretty decent until I found a hair in my take away!  The hair was mixed in a roll as well as on a piece of picked ginger. The manager didn't know how to give me a refund and, since I definitely didn't want more food from them, no thanks to a remake.  Now my I'm out my money and having to spend more on dinner. Stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"Sushi 101 is probably the name of a sushi place where I would eat - though truth be told, I'm probably even in remedial sushi, as when we have gone, I don't even always order sushi. Send me to detention.  The good news is that the staff is ultra-friendly, and doesn't seem to mind if you don't order sushi. Hey, if they put it on the menu, it's fair game. So when we order fried rice, they didn't turn up their nose or anything.  Now I get that it probably isn't their speciality - it's not like we were eating at Fried Rice 101 or anything - so it wasn't spectacular, but it was perfectly serviceable, so when we're in the mood for sushi, we'll give it a shot."}
{"text":"Came here for date night with the hubs. Hostess wasn't very friendly at all. We got sat right away because they were super slow and she picked the worst table for us to sit at. Once we got to the table she slammed down the menus and walked off. Didn't even say anything. Our server was friendly and gave suggestions. My husband got a salad and although it was big, the core of the lettuce was in there as well as a lot of white lettuce. The sushi was good but it took a very long time considering how slow they were. Also, I got the surf and turf roll and the meat in it was very small! The steak was teeny tiny! Decent sushi but nothing memorable."}
{"text":"Me and wifey tried this restaurant because we had a coupon from a coupon book that was a good deal. I was not impressed with the fried rice I had and my wife was just OK with the noodle bowl she had. I'd be willing to give them another try sometime in the near future. Nothing to write home about yet."}
{"text":"Just got back from dinner at Sushi 101.  Not sure I'll be going back.  We arrived around 5:30 and there were only at most 6 customers in the restaurant.  We were promptly greeted by the very friendly hostess. So far so good.  Then out comes our server.  She was more interested in brooding hanging out behind the curtain than taking anyone's order. When she finally did get around to taking our order  it was \"what do you want.... ugh... fine....\"  We ordered various sushi rolls(California roll, philly rolls, spicy tuna, crab roll, and some other roll) and a plate of fried rice and a side of spicy mayo. Well the sushi came out after a few min.(super fast Sushi chefs) but the server pretty much just dropped it on our table and ran away Ignoring the fact that we had 2 empty drinks and  NO SPICY MAYO. We tried for about 10-15 to track her down to but she was no where to be found. We looked around and realized we weren't the only unhappy table.  Seemed the only people who worked there we could find were the sushi chefs and felt it a little disrespectful to ask them for spicy mayo and refills.  Needless to say the service stunk, after reading the other reviews It looks like this may be a common theme for sushi 101."}
{"text":"HOW can you beat this - delicious food! Have visited this place several times already. It's like lounge-like atompshere but serves sushi...just go."}
{"text":"We shared a beef udon dish and two rolls. The udon was really good I loved the beef. There was plenty go around for two people. It was real fresh tasting. I was kinda disappointed in the sushi.The sushi didn't really compare to Osaka (in mint hill - our go to spot) or Nakatos. We had the professor vu roll and the lava roll. My boyfriend loved loved the lava roll but I wish there was more to the rolls. It lacked jazz to me. I guess I want more of a wow factor, it tasted good but kinda plain for \"special rolls\". It's down the street from our place though, so it is convenient for us to go here so we will definitely be back. I think we will have to try more things to make a better review."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a fun casual night in Ballantyne!"}
{"text":"Good sushi, even better price.  This location is tucked in the back of the Parktowne Village Shopping Center. It's kind of dimly lit at night, so it would be easy to miss if you didn't know it was back there.   Must get item: Spicy Edamame. All edamame should strive to be this. The staple app tossed in a delicious sauce. One order may not be enough for your table.  Spring rolls: These were tasty, but they were all different shapes and sizes. Nothing wrong with that... just threw us all off when they arrived.  Crispy Maki 101 Roll: Tuna or salmon rolled in nori and lightly fried. Topped with a mayo and chili sauce. I usually get this every time. I like that it's not too heavy for a fried roll.  Professor Vu Roll: Shrimp tempura and cream cheese topped with avocado, tuna and crab salad. Everything is better with crab salad on top.  Sushi 101 has some great drink specials throughout the week, but note there are no specials on Fridays and Saturdays. They are also not opened for lunch on Saturdays.   Service is always good. I have never had a bad experience here. Our server Quinn was fantastic during my last visit here Friday evening."}
{"text":"This place is great, the sushi is very fresh, i really like the abundance and variety of different sushi choices they have on the menu."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town hands down. Just ask for VU he's the head sushi chef. He can make you anything from sea urchin all the way to a California roll.   All and all I would give 6 stars if it were possible. Oh also ask about wagyu beef. ( very hard to find in this area)"}
{"text":"As a foodie and a sushi snob, I'm not easily pleased. If you're looking for excellent sushi (nigiri and sashimi) and basic Japanese dishes (ie: your fried rice, tempura dinners, noodle bowls, etc.). This place is it. Dollar for dollar the best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Being from and living in Rochester, NY California Rollin is our best sushi place in my opinion. But this place was even better! I would definitely go back and I wish they had a Sushi 101 in Rochester. My friend and I did takeout when I was here and next time I would like to eat in as it has a trendy atmosphere. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Great customer service ! I've been here a couple of times already but always forget to post something lol. Sushi was fresh, seaweed salad and squid salad was amazing and fresh also! The pics I have is an order of a Dynamite roll and Professor Vu Roll.  Also a side order of nigiri. All I have to say is, IT WAS BOMB !"}
{"text":"I am by no means picky with my sushi so I don't think i'd say it was bad, but I probably would have enjoyed some harris teeter sushi instead. They have a pretty good selection of rolls to choose from and the lunch special is a great deal but I wasn't completely satisfied with the taste. The service was very good though, always had a full cup and she was very attentive!"}
{"text":"Dear Sushi 101,   Of the things I miss about Charlotte, it's you I miss the most. Your pals Professor Vu and Crispy Bagel...and Spider Roll and Queen Roll...and the spicy aioli!  Sigh...   I've found some great sushi places in Raleigh, but wow do I miss you. I promise to keep visiting you every time I go back to Charlotte...whether it's sitting at the sushi bar and enjoying the excellent service and ambience, or a quick phone call for prompt take-out.  You're the best!"}
{"text":"Lots of options to choose from, but I feel the sushi isn't worth the price. Not bad tasting, more like average good, not exceptional."}
{"text":"The sushi is a little bit pricey, but it is definitely good. I also love the build your own noodle bowl and the Japanese fried rice. My family and I have been coming here for years and I just now got around to writing a review."}
{"text":"My husband and I go all the time. The sushi is always great as well as the service. I'm a big fan!"}
{"text":"Seriously? 3 Stars? What is wrong with you people?!  This sushi is so good. For starters, I had the squid salad. Perfect portion, & no seaweed salad filler.  We had the Dr. Vu, Lava , & spicy tuna roll. They were all exceptional. I seriously don't have a favorite. They were all perfect in a different way.  Dessert was green tea ice cream. It's definitely not the kind from the grocery store. This stuff was legit. I wouldn't order it for a child. This stuff is for the refined palette. I loved it.  Service was okay, but we also came in at 10:30pm, they close at 11pm. I know the guy was tired."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi or fresh grilled teriyaki.  The tempura vegetables are great, light and crunchy.  I really like the Panther roll and the Ballantyne roll.  The teriyaki chicken and stir fried vegetables are awesome! We have been here a few times. The service is always fantastic. We love to sit at the sushi bar, as they have an open kitchen.  I would give it 5 stars if it was a little cheaper."}
{"text":"Love it! Small, about 15 tables inside but, outside there are about 6 more. If you go during the warmer months there is a band concert in the mall on Fri. and Sat. nights. (80's, 90's, eclectic) The sushi is good and fresh and does not dip into the wallet to heavy."}
{"text":"Hello friends,  Since this will be my 3rd time writing a review for Sushi 101 I'll keep it short.  This is my go to place for a quick dose of sushi. Pretty good specials also.   TTFN"}
{"text":"Always good service here. Pretty hefty sake menu with new brands/options that have come in recently. The sushi here does it's job and is quite tasty. I recommend the Sir Justin roll - best on the menu. The Ahi tuna appetizer is sooo good. Do yourself a favor and order it next time you swing by.   The atmosphere is laid back and the massive chalk board on the side wall will always tell you what the specials are and what's new. Monday thru Thursday you can count on daily drink specials like $1 domestics (yay!) and $3 wells... not sure what days they fall but hey, just go eat sushi and you'll figure it out.   Only thing I'm waiting for is for 101 to switch up the menu a bit. I've been dining here every so often for probably about 3 years now and have yet to see a new menu hit the table - would love to see new sushi rolls and different app options already!"}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi spot. We got the Yaki soba noodles with Katsu Chicken, shrimp tempora roll and  dancing eel roll. Food was tasty and reasonably priced. Service was good. Timely and friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great for sushi enthusiasts and novices alike! Great service and a very chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"Sushi 101..it seems their cooks and waiters forgot to take that class. The food is no where close to Japanese.   We ordered tempura maki and it was okay but super greasy. The Tamago sushi was terrible. It was room temperature and tasted like it was sitting out for about 2 days. Their rice is just regular short grain rice and not sushi rice.  The Yakisoba with grilled veggies was basically a bowl of noodles topped with grilled veggies. They didn't even think to toss it so at least the spices and sauces mix.   The waiters aren't familiar with Japanese food at all.  Their menu is too long for their own good. I'd rather have a place that serves 10 dishes but makes them good instead of 40 items which all suck.  They have $1 domestic beer on Tuesdays and that is the only reason I'd go here again."}
{"text":"A good sushi spot tucked away in the back of a shopping center.   Stopped in to check out this sushi spot, and I was not disappointed. I sat down at the bar area and was greeted promptly, and the bartender was quite nice. I read some complaints about service here, but she was top notch.   Ordered the cucumber salad and the South Park maki roll. The cucumber salad was fresh and delicious, but definitely enough for two or three people to have as an appetizer. The portion was huge. The South Park roll was also fresh and flavorful, definitely something I would order again.   Overall, a decent spot for sushi that I will definitely venture back to again."}
{"text":"Great Sushi Find!!!  Their Panhandle roll was my favorite!  But their spicy tuna and shrimp tempura were just as delicious.  Also, make sure you try their chicken egg rolls for an appetizer...they were pretty on point with some Siracha sauce on the side.  This place is reasonably priced as well and we had great service, James was very attentive.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Cool looking place. Chef made us a special dish of sea bass marinate in miso. That was the best fish ever. It was fresh and light and flavorful. Miso was nicely caramelized on the fish. He also made a salmon dish for me , so good. We also got shumai which was the best I've had and I also had sushi, so fresh and delicious. Everything was so good. We'll be back ."}
{"text":"I'm surprised anyone even gave this hole a 3 star review!  Located right next door, you think the restaurant would actually fill up just taking customers who didn't fancy waiting in line at Sushi on Bloor.   WRONG.   On a Saturday you will still see 15+ people queued up outside Sushi on Bloor while Sushi 101 has 20 empty tables.  The service at Sushi 101 is incredibly, incredibly bad. We waited over 10 minutes to be served and then another 30+ minutes to get our food. Considering there were only 2 tables occupied in the whole restaurant, that is pretty inexcusable.   How this place even manages to remain in business is beyond me. There are always 2 dodgy asian guys sitting in a booth at the back who clearly work there or own the place, yet never lift a finger to help with serving or running the place. I've heard whispers that Sushi 101 is really an undercover drug op... seems absurd but it would make sense for the complete lack of customer service and very mediocre sushi.   My advice - just bite the bullet and wait in line at Sushi on Bloor. You'll still get your food quicker even if you wait 15 minutes for a table."}
{"text":"I'm definitely not a sushi fanatic but I do enjoy it occasionally. I've been here a hand full of times. Always liked it. Met my daughter for dinner tonight. The place was packed yet still got a table right away. We ordered the spider roll, spicy tuna and one other (can't think of the name, my daughter ordered it). Two issues tonight, 1st - there just wasn't a lot of flavor in the spicy tuna roll. No little kick in the sauce. And 2nd, and more importantly, it seemed that the rolls are getting smaller. The spider roll had 5 pieces. I swore it had more the last few times I've order it.  It was still very good. For the money spent ($30 bucks w/ tip) I'd like to walk away feeling a little more satisfied (full)."}
{"text":"I've been here probably 20 times. I LOVE Sushi 101 because: 1. It's so low key- very family friendly 2. The service has always been good- attentive, but not pestering 3. The quality is good. I've tried almost every sashimi and roll on the menu, and have never been disappointed with the quality of anything. Obviously there are things I like less, but that's just preference, not quality. 4. The selection is good! I mean, if you're a sushi snob, you might not think so, but I just want fresh, good tasting fish and rolls. Also, I love their red pepper appetizer- SO good. 5. It's reasonably priced! I love that I can gorge myself on fresh sushi for a reasonable amount of money! I've been to plenty of other sushi restaurants across America (and in Charlotte) where I've paid double or triple for the same amount and quality of food- and have come to realize that I was paying for fancy decor, not better quality or bigger portion size.  Look, it's not a fancy date night. It's a low-key, strip-mall ambiance.  If I have one complaint, it's that they only serve sodas in a can, so I can end up spending more on Diet Coke than I do for one of the less expensive rolls! I wish they'd get a soda fountain instead."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and ended up eating here twice in one week.  Although I haven't been that impressed with the service, the sushi isn't bad.  I stay away from nearly any of the fried items, and stick to rolls.  I thought it was decent, and a few things that impressed me.  There were others that were just pretty plain and seemed like a hodge podge of fish as well though.    It's difficult to remember everything you ordered, it normally comes all at once, so you end up with a huge place with all your rolls on them.  I stay away from the other menu items as well, I don't know... just didn't want to be filled up on other stuff when I could eat sushi.."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite sushi places. We got the lettuce wraps, the Bamboo Roll, the Sir Justin's Roll, and chicken fried rice. Everything was absolutely delicious. The rolls were very reasonably priced and the fried rice was the best fried rice I've ever had. We will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"First time eating at Sushi 101, We started with the lettuce wraps which were okay then we got 3 different types of sushi. We most likely won't go back.   The setup is a typical restaurant setup with an open design and a small sushi bar area.   The main reason I went with 2 stars is the overall feel of the restaurant, the staffs approach and enthusiasm and the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Feeling under the weather orrrrr just freezing a little because of the weather? Sushi 101 Noodle Bowl is your remedy.   Of course there are plenty of other tasty things too - I've had a variety of their sushi rolls and toured the app menu in the past. Kicked off tonight with an order of Steamed Gyoza - I will neither confirm nor deny that I drank the leftover ponzu sauce like a shot after dunking all 8  Pictured is an Any Style (with broth, vs 2 other styles) noodle bowl (Ramen, one of 5 noodle choices) with sautéed portobellos (vs steamed or fried, or plenty of other meats, shrimp etc.). Warming me from the inside with happy noodly feelings - and I could only concur half of it, so I get to relive the joy for lunch again tomorrow.  Seems like someone may have called out as servers were busing tables and seemed a tad stressed, but they were appropriately apologetic about the wait. Lots of takeout and to go orders too, although I prefer mine hot and fresh dine in.   Also they have some 90s mix jamming that I would totally stream any day of the week."}
{"text":"When you combine good sushi, friendly service and great prices, you can't go wrong with Sushi101. I've been there many times and always left satisfied."}
{"text":"This place has great fresh sushi and healthy teriyaki hibachi. If you go, try and ask for Kathy, she is an amazing waitress...truly the definition of good service. Only reason I'm not giving it 5 is because they don't offer shrimp sauce."}
{"text":"Terrible chefs choice sashimi  combo, mostly fake crab and shrimp hardly any good fish, can't  believe the chef would think that fake crab and shrimp are his best offerings. Since when did imitation crab become passable as chefs choice sashimi. Have been to the other location at the promenade many times and loved it. Really sad that this location is so inferior. Should not be allowed to carry the name"}
{"text":"Good Sushi, pretty fresh, nice place if you need a quick sushi fix that is reliable, consistent and basic.   I ordered one of their speciality roles that had tuna, white fish, avacado and tempura crunches..it was pretty good.  The pieces stayed together pretty good which was nice and they weren't too big which was also nice!  I wish there was a bit more crunch to offset the mushy avacado but that is a personal preference.    Overall the service was nice, the food was good, the price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Great sushi at an affordable price.  This place rocks. Nigiri sushi is $1 a piece for most and $1.50 for a few others.  There is a great selection of rolls and they even do noodles and yakitori.   The atmosphere is light and airy with a view of the folks making sushi out front in the dining room.  Service is prompt and friendly.  A solid four stars."}
{"text":"After craving sushi I wanted to check out Yama, but they were closed. So, the only spot I could remember was Sushi 101. And, boy, biggest regret. The service was horrible, very rude and short server. I started with miso soup, which was the only thing I was able to eat. I then ordered the surf and turf roll, salmon nigiri and a spicy tuna hand roll. The surf and turf roll is grilled meat with fried tempura, and the beef was so overlooked and dry it was uneditable. As for the tuna, what a horrible piece of tuna. I wasn't even able to chew it.  I will not return and know there are better sushi spots in Charlotte now. Don't waste your time and money!"}
{"text":"It's only been nine years since I visited Sushi 101 as my 12th review ever so I'm back for a much needed update.  Early evening with my wife and my daughter, we had a terrific meal and the restaurant was not very busy at all. A huge plate of sushi with basil rolls to start (aka summer rolls but with fresh basil inside) and we killed it. They have a bunch of the usual maki rolls and some creative ones. My wife didn't care for the spicy chicken katsu roll but I thought it was good. She still loves the Passion Roll, which is complete with sliced mango.  All of it, nicely presented and well assembled. Perfect for sharing with a small party.  No, there's no more smoking in restaurants and there hasn't been for a while.  This shopping plaza is always challenging for parking. Good luck."}
{"text":"Always fresh. This is my go to spot. I've had a ton of sushi and they never disappointed me."}
{"text":"This is probably some of the worse sushi in South Charlotte.  The food smelled extremely fishy, not what I would expect from fresh sushi, and tasted \"off\".  The service was ok, a little slow based on how busy they were.  There are certainly better options for sushi, or Asian cuisine.    I won't be back."}
{"text":"Tuesday night -dollar beer and great food. Yakitori was a good deal at 4.00 bucks each. Would go back"}
{"text":"First time there and was hopeful.  Service was awful and the food was mediocre at best.  I ordered a Super Cruncy Roll and got a California Roll...the waiter argued with me that it was a crunchy roll.  There was nothing crunchy about it.  The fried dumplings were soggy.  Our fried rice came when we were nearly finished with the rest of our meal.  Not likely to return."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE!!  This sushi might even be better than CowFish!! A fantastic, dive, off the beaten path, low key place for some of the best sushi I have had in Charlotte!! Tons of deals, great fresh sushi rolls, and noodle bowls - so even if your friends are not sushi fans there is something for them to eat too!!  Best tip about this place: Cajan edamame - not listed on the menu, but unbelievable - and the sauce at the bottom of the bowl - best dipping for sushi instead of soy sauce!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, high quality, excellent service and the chefs behind the sushi bar know how to do it right. It's hard to elaborate on that. Definitely the place to check out if you're near the neighborhood. Great at 2200 as it is at 1200. Recommended without reservation."}
{"text":"Great place and very friendly people but if you want sushi.. that's four of five.. good sushi has to be fresh!! Last few times didn't was that fresh but we'll hit that place again."}
{"text":"Sushi 101 lives up to its name. It's a basic sushi joint with not much of an umph to it and slow-ish service.  I found myself there one day in an effort to try something new (which is really hard because New Gen is just down the street) and ordered typical maki. Originally I tried to order some of their more exotic rolls, like the \"vegetarian California roll\" (cucumber and avocado, come on!) and but for whatever reason they couldn't really accommodate my requests so well.  I thought it was a bit on the expensive side but I noticed that everyone else at the place had heaps of food and I had only stuck to two items. Maybe I was at a disadvantage as the only meats I eat are salmon and tuna, but the other tables seemed pretty happy.  What Sushi 101 has going for it is that it is directly next to Sushi on Bloor. Either it will profit hugely off of the spillover from SoB (what a great acronym!) or it will simply be unable to compete.  I am not sure how long Sushi 101 will be around for but I think it will improve with age."}
{"text":"atmosphere is cooler inside than you'd think from the outside. service was attentive and the rolls are good."}
{"text":"We've always been rather impressed with Sushi 101. They are always busy, the rolls are fresh. I think you just need to know how to order, i.e spicy tuna roll-order it chopped with sriracha hot chili sauce.  A lot of the menu is fried, but hey we in the south. I just avoid that stuff. The food is quick and tasty. Can't complain!"}
{"text":"LOL  I liked this place very much, but I do think the waitress was trying a little too hard.  \"Yes, I would like the Mt. Fuji roll.\"  \"That is my absolute favorite roll!!\"  I also ordered a different one and she also let me know that it was her second favorite roll and on top when I ordered a beer with it, surprise surprise!! It was her favorite beer as well!!  I mean, I am all about customer service and all, but I got a little weirded out, but then, could she have been hitting on me??  Hmm, I will have to go back and find out for sure..."}
{"text":"First impressions are most significant and unfortunately it hit my nostrils immediately entering. I believe it's because of their fryer ventilation system is insufficient so the grease is in the air coating everything. This place needs professional cleaning everywhere, including the ceiling to get that nasty smell out. Reminds me of Cinebarre theater's smelly problem, too. But, after u sit at your table, the smell is not so overwhelming. Still, it really needs sanitation.   Sushi rice prep is the key to great sushi. Unfortunately it wasn't prepared correctly but still edible. It seemed like the rice was yesterday's or just not professionally cooked.   I had the chirashi rice which had nine sashimi pieces (three of each kind). The salmon sashimi was warm which was worrisome for it is raw. Fortunately I didn't get sick that night but still sashimi should be served cold, not warm like it must've bn laying out for a while.   Usually shredded daikon tsuma (white radish) complements sashimi but this time it was served with shredded carrots which I suppose is the establishment's choice but I usually enjoy traditional daikon tsuma after the sashimi.   The shredded carrot didn't compliment the after taste of eating sashimi for me.   For the price of the lunchtime chirashi, it was reasonable. I think it was $13.95?"}
