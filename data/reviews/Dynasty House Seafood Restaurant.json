{"text":"Dimsum in the morning is hot and fresh. But when they using cart to push around. The food is cold and not fresh."}
{"text":"Great hidden place in the West end of Toronto; Black Creek & Lawrence West. We came here for the Dim Sum but ordered more than we expected. The dim sum was on point, and very good. The eggplant with beef and beef with Chinese broccoli was excellent; not too greasy as other people say. We will definitely go back since we always go to Scarborough for the Chinese/dim sum cravings."}
{"text":"My friends and I showed up at this restaurant just past 11pm. Their sign says they close at 11pm today (Friday), but they still took us in. That was a plus!  The decor was a mix of 2/3 modern and 1/3 hole-in-a-wall style. Hole-in-a-wall style refers to the typical small Chinese restaurants you find in Downtown Chinatown: the use of plastic bags as table cloths, not-so-nice teapots and silverware, cheap-looking chopsticks, stains on teacups, and no thought given to their wall decorations. I'm NOT saying Dynasty House is a hole-in-a-wall restaurant; only 1/3 of it is hole-in-a-wall-ish. As for the 2/3 modern style, everything about it looked great! Those decorations looked new and added \"life\" to the dining area.  My friends and I were not that hungry, so I can't comment on most of their food. For some odd reason, they have a LOT of dishes in their menu. All of which are pictured in the menu. You can get single meals, or family size meals (costs more than $60). The family sized meals have fancy stuff like a whole fried crab and about 2 or 3 more dishes. We had Chicken Cantonese style noodles and cashew chicken. It was alright. It was slightly better than other Chinese restaurants I've been to. The price was somewhat alright. Our meal costs about $10 each.  I'd definitely go back to this restaurant, mainly because it felt like I can't give it a proper review without sampling more of their food, specifically their SEAFOOD. I wouldn't go out of my way to get to this place, but I'll definitely try it out whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"i'm surprised with the reviews  This place is one of the only places in the west end that serves authentic chinese food. I've been coming here for awhile when I don't feel like driving all the way to Markham and it's the exact same thing.  Things I really love here  -stir fry beef with rice noodles and black bean sauce -vegetarian version of ^ -dried fish fried rice (i know it sounds weird, but you just gotta trust me on this!!!!) -bbq pork and chicken and a bunch of other things i can't think of  I do plan on trying the dim sum here one day to avoid the chinatown traffic"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE! Avoid at all costs!  Chicken Fried Rice- Old rice that was heated up and had sour spots. BBQ Beef Spare Ribs- Decent, the only decent thing we tried. Shrimp Tofu- Tasted like old dirty grease, left a bad taste. Spring Rolls- Decent, standard store bought. Shui Mai- Edible but bland. Seafood Shui Mai, Beef Balls- Disgusting! Tempura Shrimp- Not even real tempura! Thick batter, the shrimp appeared to dissolve in it, tasted sour. Tried to tell them, they ignored us, could barely get up from the table to leave because they were counting the money then not even a bye or thank you. Worst dim sum I have ever had."}
{"text":"Good for those looking for Chinese dimsum in mid-town. Reasonably priced and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. Waiters are rude. They got our order wrong and the food was below average. Don't waste your time and money!"}
{"text":"The dim sum is not as good as many other dim sum houses you could go to in Chinatown Toronto or out in Mississauga. Location notwithstanding.... what irked me the most was the poor customer service: they brought us the wrong food, they forgot to bring out food we ordered, and it took a long time to get our bill. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Price was decent, customer service good, food quality pretty good however a tad tricky to eat with chopsticks.  I decided to try a seafood restaurant as m'lady and I were rather hungry and passing through the area, so we went to this venue.  Since m'lady and I are both white, we were immediately handed a fork each. Mine was dirty, and since I didn't feel like mentioning it to the waiting staff and also since I'm typically fine using chopsticks, I decided to let it be. The problem was that I ended up ordering duck, which I hadn't had in ages, and the way that it was presented, there was no way it could be eaten with chopsticks without using your hands (so I did just that).  Aside from that part, I found the food to be of quite decent quality, customer service was quite decent, and prices were as well.  If I was in the area, I'd very likely return to this venue, however I'd likely order something a bit simpler instead of duck."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for lunch and was thoroughly disappointed with our experience. This place used to be a family favourite when I was young but the quality of the food and service has drastically decreased.   We always order our family favourites: Shrimp Har Gao, Shrimp Shu Mai, Chicken Feet, Shrimp Rice Noodle Rolls, Beef Tripe, Bean Curd Roll, and Spare Pork Ribs with Black Bean Sauce. We also ordered the Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf and Crispy Taro Dumplings. For the most part, the quality of the food was nothing special and very similar to any other mediocre Dim Sum restaurant. However, many of the dishes were particularly disappointing. The Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf had very little meat inside. I had to eat to the centre in order to get some. The Crispy Taro Dumplings were not crispy or flaky like it's supposed to be. It was obvious that they were deep fried and left aside for a while before reaching our table. Also, many dishes including the Crispy Taro Dumplings were served room temperature.    To make things worse, the workers were rude and unhappy to bring my family some hot sauce and refill our tea. Needless to say, I'm never going back."}
{"text":"I loved the dim sum. It was fast, tasty, good sized portions. one woman working there is very abrupt though. she was eyeing us as we slipped our money inside the booklet. No, she was watching us as we took our cash our of our wallet.I'm going to forget about her and concentrate on the food. squid was cooked just right, though my sister did complained that she didn't like the second batch, as there were seven of us eating there. shiu mai was big and tasty. The bean curd with pork was awesome. The calamari was delicious. curried squid was the biggest and best tasting ones I have had in a while."}
{"text":"Really gross! Only went here cause it was on the way home. Everything had this odd taste of plastic, bad beef, old fryer oil. Couldn't get out fast enough."}
{"text":"You can look pass rude waiting staff and dingy, slightly unsanitary looking restaurant space if the food was good. Unfortunately, today was gross food. The soup tasted like it was watered down with dishwater, fried dim sum arrived lukewarm bordering cold (?!!), and despite having half of a roasted pork hanging on display, they served us old, microwaved roasted pork evident by excessive pooling grease at the bottom of the plate. It may have been better in the past, but it's a no-go as it stands today. Be kind to yourself and go somewhere cleaner (with 99% likelihood of better food too) for your dim sum fixes."}
{"text":"Before I start - I have to say a previous reviewer's comments were a hoot.  You order duck, and get a dirty fork, so your solution is to eat with your hands and make a note to never order duck again?  I might, you know, wipe the fork myself, or, brace yourself, ask them for a clean one.  Going caveman on my waterfowl might be Plan C. Annnyways, on to the review..  The place: The place is a decent size and as some reviewers said, it's a mix of funky and divey.. There are cool interlocked plastic lights hung throughout, but there are also Christmas baubles.  And they're hung from a white tiled office ceiling.  Likewise, there are some nice authentic-ish decorations around the perimeter of the restaurant, adjacent to some cottage-ey light colour wood trim/paneling.  Didn't bother me though - actually felt a bit less intimidating than a totally-authentic place would to a non-Asian such as myself.  Oh, and I give a fricking 12 out of 5 stars for the menus.  Every dish has a picture!  First (authentic) Chinese place I've been to in the city that has this, and it's brilliant.  For those of you who dislike the detail provided by the typical Chinese restaurant (whose menus are essentially a list of one-line dish descriptions, often poorly translated), you'll love this menu.  The service: Typical Chinese place.  You won't find any Jack Astor personalities here.  Expect to potentially need to flag down your server, don't expect too many smiles, do expect curt but informative responses, and you'll be totally fine.  Nothing out of the ordinary here, moving along..  The food: Pretty decent.  Got the spicy shrimp+eggplant and the Thai lemongrass pork along with some rice  - both were very good.  And as usual tea is included and unlimited.  The dishes came with forks/knives as needed, and chopsticks were also included depending on how you like to eat your bone-in pork chops.  The menu I should not has an interesting selection - mostly Chinese authentic dishes, including large group-share portions (eg. duck) and dim sum options, but also some Westernized Chinese (eg. chicken balls) and Thai dishes as well.  Great experience overall - not too pricey, great food, decent service, clean.  I'll be back 100%."}
{"text":"We live in a west-end part of Toronto that, unfortunately, has few options for Chinese Food.  I'm not talking about chicken balls, sweet and sour sauce and Egg Foo Young. While places like Panda Express and Mandarin are good, there are times when an Asian family (in our case, Canadian-Chinese and Filipino), needs some tastes from, well....childhood. (Mine and my husband's, that is)  That craving came up for my husband this past weekend, and (to my joy!) decided to have a family dinner at Dynasty House, which we have proclaimed as \"Our Family Restaurant.'  Dynasty House is about a 20 minute drive from where we live, and my husband and I can say with honesty that it's one of the most traditional, best-tasting, and most affordable Chinese restaurants that West Toronto has to offer.  It's certainly not a fancy place. It's the corner space of a plaza at Black Creek Road and Lawrence, which also houses an Asian grocery store, Pizza Hut, laudromat and some small offices. When you walk in, you feel as though a Dollarama may have exploded in there at any given season, what with the Christmas balls hanging everywhere, silk flowers scattered, and even a \"Happy Wedding\" sign splayed across their red velvet main wall.  (They actually host small weddings there and will simply block-off a part of the restaurant for the party. We've actually dined there when a wedding was taking place. Really.)  The barbequed duck and chickens are on full display. The fish tanks are filled with cloudy water, crab and grouper, all ready to be scooped out and...be your dinner. (A great show for the kids, by the way, provided they don't get creeped out seeing their dinner being scooped out with a net, and then hear a loud bang in the kitchen!) Yes, the washrooms could probably use an upgrade and an industrial scrubbing, but my Chinese Canadian husband says that he would take his Foodie mother there for dinner and if you know my husband and mother-in-law, it says A LOT.  The menu is vast and could be overwhelming, but luckily there are photos for those of you who need to \"see\" what they are ordering. The service is good - we've never had a bad experience, despite the fact that we come with our two \"dynamic\" boys.  The food? Delicious. My kids devour the Chicken Chow Mein and spring rolls happily. The sizzling steak (also a great show), is my favourite and never disappoints.  My husband always over-orders and now we have leftovers for at least one more day.  Dynasty House is casual, family-friendly (translation: LOUD), and the prices are reasonable. They really do serve delicious food. It's certainly not a fancy place, and the atmosphere isn't for everyone, but if you can overlook your surroundings, I can tell you that you won't be disappointed.  Order the sizzling steak. It's sooooooooo good."}
{"text":"Honestly, it was so quiet in the restaurant when me and my sister walked in Saturday afternoon,  they had all day dim sum so I was quite surprised to see the restaurant nearly completely empty minus a few other patrons. It was a bit of a wait since we got dim sum dishes and that needs time to steam and everything. Please this is our second time eating here.  We ordered: - Chicken feet - Tripe with scallions & ginger - Char siu bao - Curry squid  Everything was good until near the end when we had to pay. Note...guys never come around 3-5ish. Why? Because all of the staff will go on their late lunch/early dinner all at once during that time. This is a problem because they will not notice you if you need to wave them down for anything, so my recommendation is if you want a drink, flag them down before they go on break or tell them right away as they are seating you. Second problem, we finished eating right when they started their break, my sister looks at me hesitantly unsure of what to do in this situation, we flagged down a waiter, we got ignored. Tried again as another waiter comes by, again ignored. So sighing heavily, I told her to take our bill along with her purse up to the counter to pay. LIKE HOW THE HECK DO YOU IGNORE A CUSTOMER FRANTICALLY WAVING THEIR ARMS LIKE A LUNATIC TRYING TO GET YOUR ATTENTION? Anyways we paid and as we were leaving, I asked how was the damage? She said $21 and something cents. I stopped and looked at her weirdly. They had overcharged us. I had looked on the menu for item prices and the large items were labelled $4, medium for $3.50, small for $2 or $2.50, a can of pop was at least $1 to $1.50. We did the calculations even after tax and tip it only totalled to $16 something. We had 2 large items, one medium and one small along with a can of pop. So you guys do the calculation and see you if you agreed with us. Don't get me wrong, the food was good but we knew we were never going back because of shitty service."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get authentic and quality Cantonese food but everything else is lacking especially for the price point.    The food is very good.  They were cooked well and definitely authentic.  Their specialty is sea food and they definitely had quality seafood.  I would recommend ordering the package meals as it is a lot cheaper than ordering the same dishes individually.  They also have dim sum but I didn't have any.  The menus are in Chinese and they don't have English friendly menus for the package meals.  Expect to pay 20-60+ a person.  Higher end of that range if you order live seafood.     Service is garbage.  They brought us to our table before it was set.  They just plopped pates and chop sticks loudly in the center of the table.  They didn't even put it in front of us.  They were not very helpful with the menu in terms of recommendations.  I had to ask them maybe 4 times for vinegar.  I should not have to get up to get a waiter to get my stuff.  When they brought the soup, they didn't pour the first bowl which is expected.  They only speak Cantonese well.  Their mandarin is understandable but most of the service personal don't speak English.     The decor is your typical higher end Cantonese restaurant.  Banquet hall with too much red.  Their bathrooms were clean but just looked gross.  They definitely need to redo it.  Their toilet seats don't fit which is just a joke.    Come for the food but be warned."}
{"text":"Great place in the west end for gorging yourself on dim sum at Sunday lunchtime, which my daughter and I love doing. It wasn't that busy and we got a corner table, despite it being dim sum prime time. One thing that's great is the menu has photos of all the dishes, so you can point at whatever you'd like to try. The Korean kalbi short ribs, something I always order if it's available, were spiced differently than what I'm used to, but still very tasty, and instead of a measley 3 pieces serving, I was offered an enormous pile of delicious short ribs which I gobbled in a hedonistic food frenzy. The total for the 2 of us before tip was $57.30. I'm so glad we finally checked this local restaurant out and that I wasn't permanently scared off by the huge sign about chicken feet and fish maw!"}
