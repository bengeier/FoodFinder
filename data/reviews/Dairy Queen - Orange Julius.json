{"text":"I had heard abt there so called BLIZZARD but was very disappointed with the taste or   Flavor or I would say was that an nice cream"}
{"text":"This place is great... love coming here all the time! Always receive great service from the staff and it's cheap as well"}
{"text":"Gotta speak up against all the haters- how can ice cream ever be less than 4 stars? DQ is a Canadian staple, always consistently yummy and reasonably priced, unlike all those poser boutique ice creameries in the oh-too-hip cities. I'll take a Chocolate dipped softserve cone  any day!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from this DQ twice, and both times had a bad experience. Tonight I ordered a chocolate extreme blizzard (same exact thing as the first time) and left incredibly disappointed. Not enough toppings (I'm not exaggerating when I say there were 3 brownie pieces) and instead of a \"chocolate\" blizzard it looks like a whipped up vanilla shake. Not willing to waste my money a second time, we returned to let them know we were not satisfied and all she did to \"fix\" it was take my old blizzard, add chocolate syrup and whip it up again. Did not add any toppings.at.all! It tastes worse than the first time as now it has a \"whipped\" texture almost like an old shake. Very disappointed and I will not be returning for a 3rd visit!"}
{"text":"Stay away unless you want to deal with snotty teenagers who don't give a crap.  We bought two blizzards, both were low on goodies and already melted. I would have gone back but it wasn't even worth the gas.  Its too bad because this place is brand new and has potential, but whoever owns must not give a crap either.  Aside from the bad food and service, it was a big fat mess inside."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. I was completely disrespected and treated poorly, by a teenage boy worker. I ordered a brownie batter blizzard added cookie dough and walked out and got in my car. I took a few bites then searched and didn't find any cookie dough. I politely went back in and told the kid the problem and hoping to save them some time and not waste an entire blizzard I suggested I could get it on the side. The kid said \" I know for a FACT that she put it in there. I watched her do it.\" I responded, \"really? Well you can look thru it and I showed him I couldn't find any.\" He walked away and came back with a large sundae cup full of cookie dough and slammed it on the counter and said, \"there's a whole cup of it.!\" I was completely stunned. Another worker (middle aged woman) came up and asked what it was and remade it. No one apologized, and once again the kid insisted he knew it was there and that he \"wasn't a liar.\" Regardless of who was right I should not have been treated like that. I wasn't being rude or snappy, but he was completely out of line. I didn't say anything and neither did they when she handed my 2nd blizzard to me. This time it was correctly made but I'll think twice before I ever go to this location again. This happened May 3rd around 7:30pm."}
{"text":"Went in during Halloween and was immediately greeted at the door by the employee Tanner. His charm and smile was very welcoming. I ordered a snack melt and he got right to it! This location is great and so is Tanner!"}
{"text":"Walking distance from home, so this place my family frequent. Hit and miss, sometimes place is a little messy, food trail on tables, sometimes it's clean. What I like, although there's note that they don't guarantee allergy free, when I told my son had nut allergy, they took the time to clean the equipment and accomodate. It took longer for order to be ready, but never had an accident."}
{"text":"Only been through the drive thru, but the window servers always have been very courteous and attentive. There was one time towards the end of the night where the girl clearly wanted me out of her way as soon as possible so she could socialize, talking about her coworker who was about to \"throw up\", but I feel it's wrong to judge all my experiences based off one less than satisfying trip!  I would be prepared to ask for extra toppings in the blizzard, since they tend to skimp."}
{"text":"This place has Dairy Queen AND Orange Juilus at one location. How great is that? The place is very clean and new with a great staff. Most of the time when you go to Dairy Queen you get slow service from the one or two people trying to run the place, but not here. The prices are standard prices for Dairy Queen and Orange Julius as they are both national chains. This location has a dirve through for the desert hound on the go. I recommend it very much and hope they are here to stay."}
{"text":"By far the slowest DQ in the area amd always out of something I want, usually something involving Mint. Always a crapshoot but its most convenient so I keep going back. :("}
{"text":"Went in late on a saturday night the drive through was pretty backed up, so i went inside expecting a long wait. I ordered a small snickers blizzard and had it in just a few minutes. pretty happy with this location. its nice when management in any establishment makes sure that there is enough staff to handle service when things get busy. very impressed."}
{"text":"I walked inside and I ordered a blizzard. They have to serve them upside down, The guy in front of me got a pumpkin pie blizzard and when he turned it upside down about 1 ounce of ice cream spilled onto the counter. The guy be begrudgingly walked away with his ice cream.  Therefore I began to get concerned as to what my blizzard would look like. So a couple minutes later it arrives and sure enough the guy puts the spoon in it and it looks like a watery shake. I refused to accept it. He offered to fix it by putting it in the freezer. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I insisted that I get something else and that I get refunded the difference. I got a basic chocolate dipped cone and walked away disappointed. I think the drive-through people were getting lids on their blizzards and did not know what they were in for until after they drove away. I also noticed the workers seem to be confused. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich combo and an extra grilled chicken sandwich. She rang me up for a hot dog combo instead. Unfortunately I didn't realize until I got to my destination. I was bringing lunch to my daughter for her birthday using her gift card and hot dog isn't what she asked for. Also keep in mind this location doesn't offer children's meals & seems to use a microwave for majority of its food prep not exactly what I was expecting having been to other DQ locations. Kind of a waste of her gift card. Food & service not recommended here."}
{"text":"I've only ever eaten dessert here. I usually come in after 8 p.m. The service seems okay and the place is fairly clean."}
{"text":"Last year their grand opening, i waited and won 1 year blizzard so i visit once a week and they are friendly and dpesnt give any attitude for just going in for free blizzard.  Also i went to order bday cake and the manager was super nice and explained to me in details"}
{"text":"It's OK I guess.  We went here again last night after our date night dinner.  It is close to our house and I thought we would have a small dessert/sundae before returning home to feed the fur kids a bowl of their dessert (ice cream).  My girl had a hot fudge sundae and I had a pineapple sundae.  They were both OK but without any toppings.  In the olden days, you got a dab of whipped cream, some chopped nuts, and a maraschino cherry on top.  But now you get nothing.  We also notice that their \"$5 lunch\" has a hot dog as the entrée instead of the cheese burger.  Seems sorta weird to me since DQ advertises nationally about their $5 lunch being so great!"}
{"text":"Customer service is a huge thing for us. They close at 10 PM but we went in at 9:45 and was told sorry everything is already closed down we can't make anything. Why in the world would you close your restaurant 15 minutes before your actual closing time and tell paying customers that you can't do anything for them."}
{"text":"We love coming to this location. It's always clean, their customer service is always great and welcoming, and their treats are always made well and quickly. We have never had a negative experience here and it's become a weekly ritual to come here after school on Friday. I highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Service was extremely fast for having just two employees working. Got a dipped cone and a sundae waited less then a minute.  Get your Dilly Dilly :)   Great seating area!  My Local DQ also has an Orange Julius so it offers a lot of variety. The drive up menu board is easy to see and easy to order from. The customer service is always friendly, service with a smile and the food is always delicious and has a good presentation. It's a bit pricey but cheaper than other places and totally worth the price.

{"text":"Horrible Dairy Queen. Tried to pull into the drive thru around 930pm and they let the car in front of us go in and then stopped us saying the ice cream machine was broken and they were closing early. We decided to pull around the front and people we going in and coming out with ice cream. We went inside, the cashier was too busy talking to her friend so it took her a couple minutes to notice us. We finally ordered and got ice cream. Rude and mismanaged staff that lie. DONT VISIT THIS DAIRY QUEEN!"}
{"text":"Dairy Queen is over priced to begin with. I wanted a plain cone but wanted it in a cup and I just found out that it costs extra to do that. It was $3:50 for a plain ice cream. My advice is to walk to the closest store and buy a tub of ice cream for that money. oh, I should mention that the ice cream was partially melted. I understand it was a hot and therefore a busy day, but $3.50 for a melted ice cream.. now that's highway robbery!"}
{"text":"Staff at this location is confused. It is apparent that there is a total lack of leadership. It was painful to watch them work. Couldn't tell who was doing what, working the window making orders and the lobby register was unmanned for a long time with customers waiting. Orders were inconstant both in content and quantity. Watched the employees scrap the excess of into the trash and had others that the cups were not full.  Saw an employee come through the line in front of us and his order jumped to the front of the line. Our order somehow got deleted in the process. Will not be going back even though it is within walking distance of our home. I recommend the store on Higley and baseline. It is definitely worth driving 10 miles out of the way."}
{"text":"Waited 45 min. For our blizzards and when we got them they were all melted. And didn't taste good  Staff was playing around and not very helpful. Asked for a manager. Was told no one is managing at the moment.  Poor service. Very disoriented staff.  Oh. And they didn't serve it up side down"}
{"text":"Over $5 for a medium dipped cone (which was tiny)??? Dated interior. The girl that took my order was nice, but still, a tiny $5 cone!?"}
{"text":"Stay away from this dq , it's very poor . Bunch of kids working here . WHo are clueless and just lost . Can't follow simple . Instructions"}
{"text":"I don't understand people complaining about the price. That's the price. It's the same for any 4 season ice cream shop. They obviously haven't been to Bilboquet before. Anywho, the five stars is for customer service. I'm not a huge sweets person but it's a beautiful/hot day out and I'm biking around. I told the cashier (Doug) and he helped me pick out something good and simple. I asked for it to be something that wouldn't melt seeing as I still had to eat my Lafleur lunch before moving on to the creamy delicacy so he even offered to let me pay in advance (to skip the lunch rush) and that he'd make it on the spot once I was done my lunch. GO DOUG!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what all of these negative comments are about, but it's an ice cream place that normally has kids working. Relax. Lower your standards. They serve ice cream and fast food, they're not drawing up plans for your house. They've never let me down. I'll always be back!"}
{"text":"My family of 3 drove to your restaurant in our PJs to get ice cream. We were expecting to go through the drive through but were met with milk crates blocking the drive thru. I knew that the store was not suppose to close until 10pm. I went into your establishment at 933. I was ignored by 3!!! Yes 3 of your staff members . They continued to ignore me while they cleaned and kept their backs towards me . Then a 4th employee walked in right past me standing at the counter and to the back of the store. This is the worst customer service experience I have ever had. I took pictures of your staff members that are timedstamped and shows them blatantly igorning me. I intend on telling every single person I come across this horrible experience. There was a family of 6 already sitting and eating they stated that they had been turning people away for awhile already ."}
{"text":"I don't have too much to say about Dairy Queen.  The salted caramel toffee Blizzard was very good, no complaints.  The actual restaurant is nothing particularly special.  Just to be clear, there's nothing \"wrong\" here, I just don't believe in giving a high rating for one single aspect, if that makes sense."}
{"text":"Wasted more than 20 minutes waiting in the drive-thru. When we got our order, the ice cream cones were already melting and there was a BUG (gross) in our mini blizzard when we took the lid off.   We decided not to return and get our money back because we didn't want to waste even one more second there. Everything went into the garbage and we went to another ice shoppe."}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen has the most incapable, uncaring, and rude employees. I ordered a salted caramel truffle blizzard and they gave me a turtle pecan. When I got it I drove home but when I got home It didn't look right so I had my girlfriend try it and she confirmed it was turtle pecan. I am allergic to pecans so luckily I didn't eat it. I promptly went back to explain how my order was messed up and they girl employee at the window was highly annoyed with me. I just wanted the blizzard I ordered. She then asked for my receipt which had the salted caramel truffle on it so she asks for a new one and was highly rude and not sympathetic at all or cared that her mistake could have given me a reaction. The girl had curly hair and tattoos please avoid this location at all costs and get some employees that actually care about their job and customers."}
{"text":"I ordered a cake and accidentally put the wrong date. They were able find a cake that was already prepared, wrote the Happy Birthday message on it and all with a smile, under 5 minutes and thanked me for my business. Good service! I also appreciated the employee who walked back behind the counter to wash his hands that greeeted me while I was waiting because it looked like I hadn't been helped yet (even though I had). Nice to see the whole staff taking care of all the customers."}
{"text":"Hmmmmmm ... proche du travail, servant même des sandwichs et des hot dog ! C'est parfait ! Le soleil et un bon lait frappé riche et crémeux .... Hmmmmmm.... near work, serving not only ice cream but also sandwiches and hot dogs ! That's heaven ! Sun and milkshakes rich and creamy ...."}
{"text":"Never fill the cups all the way up and unless you ask for extra toppings you get hardly any. Don't waste your time! Drive the extra distance to a different DQ!!"}
{"text":"Located on Peel street next to Zibo. I tried most of their flavors and the ones that i like are the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Blizzard, Frosted Fudge Brownie Blizzard, Chocolate Xtreme Blizzard. I never tried their frozen cake. They look tasty and yummy. I will take advantage of the next occasion in order to buy one of their frozen cake."}
{"text":"The Reese's Extreme Blizzard has been airing on commercials and it looked so good so I had to have one. I haven't been to a Dairy Queen in like 20 years. It was Easter and I wasn't sure if they were open but their website said they had a drive thru and were open till 10, so I took my husband and dog for a quick DQ run at 9:30 and the girl who took my order was nice and sweet and my blizzard was delicious and was made really fast. No complaints here!"}
