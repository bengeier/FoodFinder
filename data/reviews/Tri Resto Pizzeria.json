{"text":"Amazing service. I will definitely return. They went out of their way to make sure I received the best service. Gave me soup while I was waiting for my dinner. Then brought me fresh fruit which is not even on the menu. Very impressed with this new place. Can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"Great service! The staff was prompt with my order and very inviting. Had a Margherita pizza and it was perfectly cooked! I would recommend to anyone.

{"text":"This place is just ok. The pasta penne with spicy tomato sauce and spaghetti with meatballs are mediocre. The young woman who took my delivery order could not spell basic words and did not know their own menu items. The Caesar salad was crispy and good. They gave free soup which was good too."}
{"text":"Wa wa weee waaa. I think I have found another gem in the neighbourhood!

I ordered the Pollo pizza, it tasted amazing, the ingredients were super fresh and the crust was thin, crunchy and so good. After eating the pizza, we were served a plate full of fresh orange and apple slices which was a very nice detail.

Also, super friendly and smiley staff. They opened a few months ago and they really wanna make sure you feel welcome when you come in and you feel full and happy when you leave.

Will come back for sure, this place is 10 mins from my place and I'm so happy I found it :)"}
{"text":"Quality ingredients, attention to detail, and reasonable prices are what set Tri Resto apart. The owners have obviously put a lot of thought and care into getting this right, and they have succeeded. The bottle of basil infused olive oil at the front is just one example.

I've had the pizza and wings so far - both excellent - and look forward to trying more dishes. The pizza dough is light and of good texture, the cheese unprocessed, the sauce flavourful yet subtle and applied with restraint. Toppings are real and generously applied. The wings are meaty and saucy and the 'medium' heat sauce is tangy and delicious."}
{"text":"We live in the neighbourhood but only thought to check out this restaurant because we received a flyer in the mail.  We were also enticed to try because of the free delivery.  Ordered the Deluxe and Hawaiian pizzas, pizza bread and 1 lb. of medium wings.  Pizza was extremely thin crust, which I love because you're not getting full on empty carbs.  Pizza toppings were quite loaded and made for an authentic taste.  Wings were a great deal at $10 for 10 wings - can't go wrong with that.  Pizza bread was a bit of a letdown; had ordered it because some past reviews mentioned it as a delicious appetizer but I found it rather bland...literally like eating pizza crust.  We were given complimentary potato soup I think so that was a nice touch, quite flavourful.  Delivery was 1 hr. from time of ordering to door.  Found it kind of odd that customers would be charged a fee for debit/credit card use so we paid cash.  Overall, nice to try but given the overall experience and value, found out later it's better to order our usual Domino's pizza so yeah..."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner tonight based on the good reviews on Yelp. Tried the lasagna, the Hawaiian pizza and the large antipasto plate. 
Pizza crust was very authentic and perfectly cooked, one of the best we've had in Toronto. Pizza price was very fair. The lasagne portion was large and it tasted great. Good variety of antipasto which was beautifully presented. 
Quick and friendly service. They treated us to a small bowl of the daily soup (butternut squash) each, and brought our daughter an ice pop for a dessert, as well as a fruit plate for the adults. 
Good prices and great service, as well as excellent food will certainly have us coming back. 
Tip: there are 4 more specialty pizzas on the take out menu than are listed on the placemat menu, so check that too!
This place is low key, not fancy, so if you're looking for a chic place to eat, you won't be badly. If looking for family-run with great food and great bang for your buck where kids are treated great and can colour while  you wait for your food, you'd better check it out!"}
{"text":"Came in hoping for some high expectations from all the reviews but wasn't as satisfied as I thought it would be. Tucked away in a corner on Dundas street West is a small italian restaurant. The restaurant itself had approximately 5 tables in total and could probably sit no more than 15 people at a time. Once entering you're greeted by very friendly people. The business itself seems to be family run with the son being the chef and the daughter being the hostess/server. 

We ordered their calamari, spaghetti carbonara and a build your own pizza (with toppings pepperoni and hot soppressta) Once the order was placed you're given a small bowl of their daily soup special. It was tasty and also a nice way to warm up from walking in from the cold. The dishes we ordered came quickly after. Calamari was good and had good seasoning to it and came out super crispy. Spaghetti carbonara was not what i was hoping for... it was super greasy and didn't have the bacon flavour i was hoping for.. Also they over powered it with black pepper and ultimately was turned off by the taste. Hubby ordered the build your own pizza and it was good but it wasn't anything amazing IMO. 

Very standard restaurant with not much specialty.. the saving grace is the friendly server/chef!"}
{"text":"Victor makes sure that his customers are satisfied.  The pizza was delicious and we also the homemade soup was flavourful.  Thank you Victor!"}
{"text":"Just had my 1st experience with this new restaurant in my hood.  Ordered delivery after receiving a menu in the mail.  Wow, pleasantly surprised.  Food was fresh.  Delivery service was quick and friendly.  Ordered the margherita pizza, Spaghetti Con Polette (w/ meatballs), house salad and potato+leek soup special that came with a garlic type bread.  It was all really tasty.  Pizza was really, really good.  Thin crust/pie style but without the luxury price tag that most charge for this type of pizza.  I think I may have found my new go to place for pizza in the junction.  All the food came very fresh.  And tasted like it was all made from scratch.  I have to say, Im pleasantly surprised.  Very affordable vs what similar places offer in the area and portions are a good size.  Great value and quality.  Next time, I'll try dining in."}
{"text":"If you live in the Junction you may remember the 3-for 1 pizza place that used to be on the north west side of Dundas & Gilmour. (I think that was the name) It recently closed down but the main cook there is now part of the TriResto family at the corner of Runnymede & Dundas. I finally made it over....walked over, actually, with my family. Restaurants in this neighbourhood know that being kid-friendly is important! The food was tasty and fresh. service was friendly, ambience was casual and the prices are great! Oh, and they give you chilli oil with your appetizers - nice touch. We've found a new neighbourhood fave."}
{"text":"I have ordered from them & ate in several times.  I've had their wood oven pizzas, pasta, salmon & Caesar salad.  All of which were awesome & the best I've ever had for much less money than other places offering the same thing.  The service is wonderful too.  I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice enough people and the facility looks clean and organised but the pizza was below mediocre. I had a meat loves pizza and it was one of the worst I've ever had, I would not go back."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my dad. The food was excellent! Unassuming place with Vietnamese owners, but they make some tasty Italian food! 

The service was great, as Victor and Paul are very courteous and generous. Tried the House Salad and the Spaghetti Carbonara. Good portions and great flavour. My dad went the night before with the rest of my family and said the pizza is also very good. 

Check this place out! Good eats!"}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem in the city! Everything is made fresh with quality ingredients, and low prices.
I love their pastas, my personal favourite is probably the Carbonara. Sooooo creamy.
Their pizzas are fantastic too (thin and crunchy crust, but soft in the middle), and you get to watch the cook hand toss the dough to order so you know its fresh!
I also highly recommend the meatball appetizer! It comes with garlic bread (!!!) and it's SO delicious drenching it in the tomato sauce and eating together with the meatballs and Parmesan. The calamari is great too.
If you like spicy food, remember to ask for their chilli oil!
I would 10/10 recommend Tri Resto over any other pizza joints in the area. I see them doing a lot of take out orders as well, so it's a great idea when you're watching a game with friends at home and you're sick of eating cardboard from Pizza Pizza. You get much more menu options to choose from as well.

P.S. the younger cook there is pretty cute too, ladies :P"}
{"text":"Great service, nice staff! Yesterday, my boyfriend and me accidentally found this restaurant. We really enjoyed the meal. For sure we will go back in the future!"}
{"text":"Tri Resto Pizzeria is just right at the corner of Dundas St West and Runnymede so you cannot miss it. The food is delicious and the staff are amazing. The dishes are handcrafted and the combinations of favours are exquisitely blended. This is one of the hidden gems in Toronto and one of the places that you need to visit at least once if you are ever in the area. 

I had a simple Caesar salad with soup, a crafted pizza, and calamari. Everything was extremely tasty and filling; completely satisfying.

Drop by if you have the opportunity, you won't regret it!"}
