{"text":"My family and I came to the boulevard mall this past weekend to get out of the heat. We each ordered one of the big ny style slices and were pleasantly surprised by how good it was! The customer service was also great the girl behind the counter, Nicole, had a smile on her face and was very fast and friendly! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pepperoni pizza from Uber Eats and had it delivered. I opened it up and it was sausage. It wasn't good, it was mediocre... the mozerella sticks were sloppy looking and there was cheese everywhere. Bummer!"}
{"text":"Best place,delicious pizza. And Women Natalli was very friendly. I will be back soon Thank You!"}
{"text":"It was horrible, I should have never ordered. They gave me the wrong topping, the calzone was sad. I didn't know that I'd be this disappointed."}
{"text":"Pizza and wings were great. The pizza is more of a thin crust which I love. My son and I enjoyed it. I would  definitely order from here again. Book marking this place for next time."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good for food-court pizza. I didn't have high hopes, especially considering the rash of 5- and 1-star reviews, but dang. Great deli-style pizza, with tons of cheese and flavorful pepperoni. Despite being flung into the oven for under a minute, it was just the right temperature. Can't speak to anything else on their menu, though. 
Note that there is a credit card fee, and they do deliver."}
{"text":"Had the Lasagna Took a little time but was worth the wait, nice and Cheesy came with Garlic bread & a soda for only $6.99 The Cashier Nicole is very nice"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service,, very nice clean and great pizza totally recommend it! Thanks guys for making my visit pleasant."}
{"text":"Their baked Ziti has become one of my favorites:) they are starting to bring new items to their menu as well. I have been shopping at this mall for yrs. and i've seen a lot of changes. Glad to see some make changes for the better."}
{"text":"I had there slices of pizza and it felt like I was in New York all over again! Must try! Definitely will come back to them!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had in my life. I work at the shoe cleaning business next to it and I always get pizza from there."}
{"text":"Pizza was great. Crust was perfect. The cheese was yummy. It had just the right amount of sauce. I asked for pepperoni, pineapple and bacon. They put ham instead of bacon. Pizza was still delicious down to the last piece of crust. We also got bbq wings and medium fingers. The wings were big and the sauce tasted delicious. They were cooked perfectly. The fingers were good. Had an order of jalepeno poppers too. Everything was tasty. I ordered from Eat24 app. Had it delivered. Food came earlier then predicted. We will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Order a philly cheese steak sandwhich lunch special. On the menu it didnt specify the sandwhich came with mushrooms. I dont eat mushrooms. The sandwhich had more mushrooms than meat and the fries that came with the order were stale."}
{"text":"We thought it was great.  Girl that answered phone and took order was efficient and sweet.  They quoted 45 minutes.... delivered in 40.  Very good pizza.  Hot and tasty.  5 stars from us."}
{"text":"We ordered fingers and fries combo. It took about 40 minutes to get the order and it was wrong. We needed to get back to work so we took order and left. We didn't realize they gave us chicken wings not fingers until we got to work. I know we should have checked. I ordered mild and got hot. I only ate the fries.  We called and spoke to Ana who said she would refund my money if I came back but we just want to get comp when we go back. I will update the review when we go back. 
***Update***
We got our free chicken fingers and fries after the bad experience. Nicole was very nice and we got the food in a timely. The fingers and fries were decent. We would go back again."}
{"text":"I believe the cook was actually Italian, and did a really great job making my philly cheesesteak and my lady enjoyed her \"hawaiian\" pizza slice as well. 
Prices were reasonable.. My Philly cheesesteak came with fries and a drink, $6.99. Her big proportioned slice of pizza was about $4.99. 
All in all--- the food in my opinion rated 4.5 stars, no complaints there.
Our only complaint that gives this place a 2 star was the cashier lady who seemed to be the owner (from her being on the phone a few times, and stocking the drinks and such I'd assume). She didn't come off friendly right from the get-go (what do you expect ordering at a food court from a mall), but what got us was how we literally just got done ordering our food and she FORGETS to tell the cook  about my cheesesteak order.. 
I stand there for a good 2-3 minutes, while my girlfriend already had finished her slice of pizza.. 
Then deciding it's been too long so she ends up asking her about the cheesesteak to where she replies with a \"oh I forgot...\". **THAT'S NOT THE END**   After a few minutes of us waiting while she was busily on the phone, she asks my girlfriend, \"What are you waiting for?\" .. My girlfriend says, \"the cheesesteak\", and she happens to just hand it to her like it was a piece of sh**.. 
Eat here if you don't mind the attitude and possible long wait for anything else on the menu besides pizza. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Ordered off eat 24. The they were 3.9 miles away. I live by desert Inn and Valley view. They called me after I placed my order and said that the delivery driver didn't want to go. Who runs a business were the delivery drivers say that they won't deliver. Worst experience from eat 24 ever."}
{"text":"I order chicken Alfredo and loved it .. totally will come again, mozzarella sticks as well are good , is inside the boulevard mall and I really loved it"}
{"text":"Don't even waste your time or money. Food takes forever and arrives cold. I live a half mile from this place and it took almost 2 hrs. 2nd star  because the food is decent cold. Order Maguras instead."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's convenient, fresh quality and taste yummy! 

Who can beat the 2 slices of pizza and a drink for $6.99 special?!"}
{"text":"There was only one female working at the time, the pizza in the display looked cold and old. The salad looked fresh. It seemed like people were waiting a long time for their pizzas. My son ordered a buffalo chicken pizza, took about 20 minutes but it was super tasty and delicious. Price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Placed an order through the Yelp app.  Order was stuck on Confirming Order for 15 minutes. I called the location to confirm and the guy just kept going on and on about Eat24.  I told him I did not place it through that.  He kept saying he doesn't have a app device and can't get my order so Eat24 has to call him.  He did not ask my name or even attempt to take my order.  Completely incompetent.  Don't waste your time with this joke of a business.

Revised:  TWENTY minutes after ordering a guy from Eat24 calls to confirm my order.  He explained they serviced the Yelp orders.  I told him what happened and that I cancelled the order.  This took entirely too long for this service to call about the order.  So, 20 minutes after ordering technically the restaurant still did not have my order.  

If the owner reads this, do yourself a favor and either update to a modern device that has an app so you receive your orders or skip Yelp Ordering all together.  You lost my business."}
{"text":"Customer service sucked. I asked the man helping me if they had cheese pizza he said yes in the oven I asked how long will it take he replied I'm not sure. I also ordered a small drink only for it to be filled more then half way with ice"}
{"text":"We didn't get what we ordered.. Order 8 chicken fingers and got 20. Needless to say, will order again."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 pizzas at 8:30pm and was told it would be 45-60mins. It have now been almost 3 hours and I said it was cooking. Now eat24 is saying its closed and no one is answering the phone. I actually did want my pizza so im pissed."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????...???????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Coming from the east coast, I know what pizza should taste like and this is the best pizza in the area. A lot of variety on the menu and the best place to eat at the boulevard mall"}
