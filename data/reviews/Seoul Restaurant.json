{"text":"Came here with some friends and was pleasantly  surprised.   I don't quite remember everything we ordered but I got a bulgogi soup with chewy noodles. I figured that since I love bulgogi, soup and chewy noodles individually... I couldn't go wrong with the choice. It really was just so so. There was a lot of meat but nothing else. I couldn't even find the noodles unless I dug around a bit. The soup itself was also a little too sweet, but had good flavor. My friends really enjoyed their dishes though.  Service was great and prices are typical for Korea town. It's not the best restaurant in but the homey feel and Korean comfort food is definitely something I'd come back for."}
{"text":"My go to for pork bone soup. There is plenty of meat in every bowl, and the service is good. I can't eat spicy food, and they are happily accommodate me with not putting any hot spice in my bowls"}
{"text":"The pork bone soup was absolutely delicious. The bibimbap I had was okay. Everything is very reasonably priced. The service was excellent and quick. Very simple and unassuming environment. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food just like your mom would cook (all cooks are older Korean ladies)! The service is always prompt and portions are fantastic!"}
{"text":"After canvassing K-Town for awhile the pork bone soup here is excellent, i've never had the orange grease Joeie is referring to although I am quite aware of it.  For $10 including tax and tip, it hits the spot for me before heading down into the city at night."}
{"text":"Agree with others, the pork bone soup is very popular here. The restaurant was packed on sat night. Almost every table ordered at least one pork bone soup. The broth stood out from other restaurant!!  Only one server was in this busy restaurant. He was great, refilled our side dishes upon request in a timely manner.  However the bibibap and spicy rice cake dishes were just average."}
{"text":"My first time here and I love the pork kimchi tofu stew with rice. Comfort food at a very affordable price. If you crave Korean food, this would be a frequent haunt for students and families on a budget but wanting value and flavour."}
{"text":"It was my first time going here for lunch with my bestfriend and I don't regret it at all! It looks like a family run business and they were really friendly! Our waiter who seems to be the owners son, was very helpful and tentative. We got the ddukbokki with kimbap and some other rice plate, it was all exremely delicious! The price was very good and it got me very full! Their washrooms, utensils, tables are cleaned very well too! The weather was extremely cold that when we entered, it felt like I was at home because the place was warm and very cozy :) The vibe of the people in the restaurant was really good as well, everyone seems to be happy! I definately want to go back to try their hot pots or one of their korean pancakes!"}
{"text":"We went for an early lunch on Sunday. Service was friendly and fast. And the food was delicious. For our first time eating in Koreatown, I was very happy with the price and the quality of the food. Will definitely be by again."}
{"text":"I've given it a four, but if I could, it would be four-and-a-half.  I've been to a lot of Korean places on Bloor, but this is the one that I keep going back to. It's fast, INCREDIBLY cheap, and the food is excellent.  I suppose you could call it a restaurant, but I tend to consider it more of a dining hall. You go in, order your food, eat, and get out. It's not really the sort of place where you'd have a social function, or first date.  You're hungry. It's cheap. The portions are huge. The food is excellent. The service is speedy."}
{"text":"ordered omurice and rice roll. Everything is mediocre. Not horrible, not amazing, the kind of thing you can do at home. The side dishes are disappointing, I will say below the average of Korea town. The service is nice though."}
{"text":"I got the combo 1 which had the rabokki and kimbap. It was my first time having kimbap and It was delicious! However, there was too much noodles and not enough rice cakes in the rabokki. Also, the rice cakes were extremely overcooked and melted in my mouth. In the end, the whole meal costed me only dollars."}
{"text":"This place has always provided me with great service and delicious food. They also include side dishes alongside your order which is a nice touch also."}
{"text":"Undeniably - the seafood hot pot to share is the best darn dish I've ordered in the last 4 months.   A huge heaping pot of deliciously medium-spicy soup bubbling and absorbing the flavours of it's many 'friends' - including (but certainly certainly not limited to) shrimps, prawns, squid, tofu, cabbage, sprouts and clams. Add the option of 6 dumplings for only $3.00 and by golly, you've got it made. The entire meal comes to just over $10/person (sharing with one other) and you and your dining partner will undoubtedly come away incredibly, even deliriously, satisfied."}
{"text":"There is something so comforting about eating food from your own culture. I came to this restaurant all through my student days, when money was tight and the creature comforts of home were missing.   The food tastes like it is home cooked ~ there's a familiarity about it. It's not the best, but it is good for the price. My favourite is the Budae Chigae, which is a mish mash soup of random ingredients including rice cakes, kimchi, cabbage and Spam. Might not sound so appetizing but it's delicious! The side dishes are also quite good and generous ~ It is a pet peeve of mine when Korean restaurants skimp on the side dishes.   The service was great, our server was attentive and friendly. I believe it is the same staff for the last decade.   It is still my go-to place for quick, cheap Korean food."}
{"text":"This place in my opinion has the best tasting gamjatang in Toronto. I haven't been able to find another restaurant that has the same taste as this one. The price is also so much more reasonable that some others in the area here or north york."}
{"text":"Good prices and lots of selection on the menu. Service was good too but bean sprout sidedish was not fresh enough. Pork cutlet was a bit over done but the sauce was good, and they were generous with the sauces and salad dressing.   Also, they use styrofoam for take out containers."}
{"text":"If you're living in Toronto, chances are you'd be craving soupy stuff most of the time. Most of the time, it will be soup from timmies. At other times, you'd be craving for some homey soup. That's when I usually come here, even though I'm not korean.  The best thing here is their budae jigae hotpot+bulgogi topping. The bulgogi is a must. It adds some sweetness to the soup and reduce the sour & spiciness of the broth. I've ordered without bulgogi before and it tasted like it's missing something.  The other thing that's a must to order is their rabokki+kimbap combo. The perfect accompaniment for the above hotpot. All of these can feed 4 people and will cost $9/person even with tax and tips included. This place is truly the best bang for the buck for college students."}
{"text":"This is the best authentic, homestyle Korean restaurant in the area. It really reminds me of being back in Korea. A very small, simple restaurant with inexpensive dishes. The Kalbi with crystal noodles (add those for extra $2) is my favourite dish there. Great quality for price."}
{"text":"The best pork bone soup I've ever had! Full of flavour, spicy and fall off the bone meat! They give you about 3 or 4 big pieces of pork bones that are meaty enough to fill you up. The broth is something you don't wanna waste cause it's so good! They also add a potatoes and some nappa cabbage and bean sprouts. Great bowl of soup for a cold chilly night but I'd eat it any night and not get sick of it. The rice cake isn't too bad as well but I've had better. Also good to get the hotpot of the pork bone you can add extras to the soup like dumplings, noodles, tofu, etc. Their side dishes are pretty good as well my favourite being the seaweed and Kim Chi.  I enjoy the Kim Chi ban chan it's spicy, sweet and salty good flavour combo. I've recommended this place many times for their pork bone soup and no one has ever disliked it. They also have pretty good pork and Kim Chi stew as well amongst other things. I though was not a fan of the omurice dish."}
{"text":"It does have that mom's cooking vibe - that is, the Korean way.   Good food, experienced cook, reliable for consistent standards - and I must commend it for its unusually good banchan - I especially like their seaweed banchan.  I've went back several times since my first visit in February; try it once, you just might too."}
{"text":"This is probably the only place that I can order a Pork Bone Soup and really enjoy it. I've been coming here for 2 years now and to this day enjoy the food. What makes this place special is that I can order the pork bone soup without any spicy. When you do the broth is clear and tastes differently in a good way. Some places either don't allow you to do so or it's just doesn't taste good. Service here is good and the price is even better. They stack up your bowl with a lot of meat for the price of $8! They also take card, which can be a struggle in K-town. I just wished they had potato in their soup. But other than that, I highly recommend this place if you like Pork Bone Soup."}
{"text":"I go to this restaurant once a month. This is the best korean food I ever had in the downtown Korean town because I had tried every single korean restaurants in the area. Their Soon Tofu and Jae yuk bokum kimchi are my all time favorite! The price is probably the cheapest in the area and the food is great.   I have seen that they dry the utensils with a clean cloth and air dry the water cups on the side. Washroom is always clean and free of unpleasant smells. So don't worry about the cleanliness and sanitation of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Apparently the rest of the menu is quite good, but the only thing I had here was the bulgogi beef, which was flavorless and gristly. Ugh."}
{"text":"Was in the area as a tourist and honestly did not know where to go since it was pretty much the same kind of restaurants everywhere. However, I decided to try this place because it was decently filled. There was only one waiter and although the service was a bit slow, it was obvious that he was trying his best to satisfy everyone. We ordered the pork bone rice dish (recommended by the waiter) and was not disappointed at all. it was AMAZING and i would recommend it to everyone. It is also incredibly cheap. super authentic korean food at an incredibly cheap price! would come back to toronto just for this."}
{"text":"TLDR; THE best korean restaurant in Toronto.   My family and I came here TWO times during the weekend we visited Toronto, so you know this place was good enough to come more than once!!  This restaurant has quite an extensive menu but I would say that anything you order here will be AMAZING. The first night we arrived to Toronto, we came here and ordered the donkatsu, budae jjigae (1 serving), pork bone soup, and the jaeyook bulgogi. The portion size for everything was enough for one person to be filled to their stomach. The food was so good that the morning before we were leaving Toronto, we came again! We ordered jajangmyun, donkatsu (again), ddukbokki, bulgogi, and the beef omurice. OMG THE BULGOGI OMURICE THO. It was so big and definitely enough to be shared with another person. We even received complementary fried sweet potato from the owner :') The donkatsu, bulgogi, pork bone soup and the beef omurice are recognized as popular dishes on the menu and they definitely proved to be the best. Also, the side dishes tasted very homemade - my mom was raving about them saying they tasted like her mom's side dishes (so you know this is as authentic as it gets) haha.  The prices on the menu all include tax. But I would say that the price is more than reasonable for the quality and serving size they give (usually can get a meal under $10!!!).  From the outside, it just looks like a local korean restaurant, but I promise you that once you walk in and eat here - their food and service deserves the best praise! There's a friendly family vibe here that makes the dining experience comfortable for anyone. My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our meals and dining experiences here. This restaurant left such an amazing impression on me that the next time I visit Toronto, I will DEFINITELY come back!!"}
{"text":"Giving a one star review after a bad experience I had. I actually returned a few times as I was craving Korean food and it the area, my go to spots were either too packed or closed down for something quick and easy. After this experience, I guess I'll need to find another quick and easy choice around.   I went with a couple of friends and ordered a soup/stew that was flavourless and unfilling... unfortunately there was a piece of tape floating in my soup! I questioned how it got there but I don't think anything could really help me after that experience. Second, one of the side dishes tasted like cleaning products... It was such a turn off that I lost my appetite.  Sorry to say that I won't be back here. I hope the business will be more thorough to prevent such incidents in the future."}
{"text":"Un autre restau dans K-town à la deco plus simpliste et aux plats plus simples. Le budget est plus que raisonnable et vous pourrez vous en sortir à environ 15$ tips compris. Service un peu débordé mais attentionné. PS: pas d'alcool servi ici."}
{"text":"Though this may seem to be an obvious name for a restaurant in downtown Toronto's Koreatown, this is the one with a white and orange sign, located at 621 Bloor West. I've been here more than four times and the food is always hot, fresh, and tasty- very consistent place, one which gives the impression of being family-owned and operated. The most delicious pork bone soup is served here, as well as crispy yet chewy seafood pancakes. Chap-chae with beef was hot and delicious. Bonus: the last couple of times I was there, music or soap operas were not blasting. A must-try."}
{"text":"Items are very cheaply priced but are also very delicious!  I love their jajangmyun and Korean fried rice (with egg on top!) here; the kimbap and yukgaejaeng are also tasty."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant with a large group on a Friday evening and we had a really good experience. When we first walked in, I noticed a weird smell, but if you can get over that, you will truly enjoy yourself.  They immediately brought us tea, water and some traditional appetizers, which I thought was a really nice touch.  I ended up ordering a chicken stir fried rice with vegetables and a fried egg. It was made both gluten and dairy free and it tasted fantastic!  I was really happy with my dish and I ate it all. It's a really generous portion but it was so food I was tempted to keep going.   Everyone else ordered tons of dishes varying from soup to hot plates and everyone enjoyed what they purchased. I would definitely return to this restaurant to dine again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and even better prices its not upscale but when you want good korean food this is the place to go in korean town."}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite Korean restaurant in Koreatown when I lived in the neighbourhood several years back. I try to stop by whenever I'm in the area which isn't often at all. I distinctively remember how I used to be amazed at how good the gimbap was despite it being a simple dish and the omurice brought back memories of my childhood in Taiwan. Came back yesterday to show it off to my bf who's not a big fan of Korean food and was surprised to find it's not as I remember it. The rice in the gimbap was mealy and had a strange musty taste to it. I used gochujang and the sauce from my ddukbokki to give it some flavour. My boyfriend's omurice was flavourful, but rice-heavy. They're still very generous with the side banchan and the seaweed and bean sprouts are some of the best I've had. The service is friendly and quick, but you do have to flag the waiter down; they'll leave you alone to your meal otherwise. This place is very cheap which explains why there are a lot of single-person tables nabbing an affordable home-cooked dinner here. Our meal came to $20 for three dishes and a soda. Maybe they were just having an off day, judging by the other positive reviews on Yelp... I certainly hope so for the next time I'm back!"}
{"text":"Okay, I dropped last week to this place, my hopes where high, as I was hungry and a few friends and a few Yelpers had written well about this place and their menu is fairly large.  First, it is small but then again, no so small compared to the other places in the hood, so it is not bad. Now the location's windows where all fogged up due to the people and the cooking, and the place was warm even though there is no double doors to keep the cold air coming in when someone comes in. The decor is 'meh,' so again, as expected in this part of town.  Now to the food, I got myself their pork bone soup, as part of my 'Pork Bone Soup Challenge' where a few friends are in the search of the best pork bone soup in town.   The taste was good, however my soup came with that orange grease and quite a lot of fat floating on it. My date and me had to fish the stuff out as we ate our soups. So there was this orange slime on top of the bone bowl they give you on the side. She took a lot of that goo out, more than me, so I was left with \"ewww\" feeling that I was eating some of the stuff I had not taken as I had already dropped some of the rice on my soup and it was too late to separate it.   Their other dishes, like their broths, where they bring you a small stove to cook your own dish, hotpot style looks fun although I had better elsewhere. Although I was left thinking about trying their seafood hotpot, which did look interesting. However we were not hungry enough.   Now, as far as my one experience, I would not come back here for pork bone soup at all, when there are definitely much, much better and certainly dependable places  just down the street.   I *might* be back for their seafood hotpot though."}
{"text":"The service and food is fantastic! The prices are extremely reasonable ( you can get a meal under $10) and there are plenty of side dishes which is also bottomless! The portions are plenty and it is very authentic.  The servers are very kind and go beyond to help you. If you leave something in the restaurant they will run outside to find you to return your item. If there is an error with your order they will do their best to accommodate you! Honestly it's a really great restaurant :)   Its my go to place for Korean food."}
{"text":"Came here so many times and only writing a review now!  I love this place based on these 3 factors...  1) Quick/attentive service. Yes. 2) Cozy, family-style feel - Hello Kitty platters? So cute. 3) Great food + affordable prices.  Their Korean sharable hot pot is such a value price especially if you're sharing between 2+ people. On the menu, it says it feeds two but it's SO much food. I have tried the army base hot pot, pork bone soup hot pot, and bulgolgi hot pot has fed up to 4 people (including me) comfortably. I recommend it for a good and tasty sharable meal for cheap! Best comfort food; feels like mom's kitchen :P"}
{"text":"I will be very upfront about this fact: I went to the downtown K-Town with the eager intention of eating at Royal Boonsik, only to be left outside in the cold because it wasn't operating on Sundays.  Fortunately, I stumbled upon this little gem. I was on a bunsik crawl, anyway, so I was in high spirits nonetheless. I had tried Umji Bunsik, Mama Chef, and other similar restaurants.  Seoul Restaurant is one of my favourites, and now that Royal Boonsik has closed down, it's at the pinnacle of my bunsik experience.   For my bunsik crawl, I stuck with the ubiquitous and iconic combination of dukbokki and kimbap.  This duo was introduced to me by my bf, who taught me that these are equivalent to having ramen with a side of fried rice or having beer to whet the appetite when eating fried chicken.   With this mindset in place, many bunsik restaurants also sell combo deals that pair dukbokki with kimbap. If you're not one for kimbap, then you can always replace it with other simple sides, such as the less carb-centric oden (which is a great addition for a cold wintery night, might I add!).  Essentially, I have become accustomed to ordering dukbokki with kimbap, dipping the kimbap into the dukbokki's sauce to add some spicy zing to the roll.  Now, because so many bunsik restaurants have this combo, what makes Seoul Restaurant stand out?  Its trump card is its mind-blowning jajang dukbokki.   The Jajang Dukbokki is one of many variations of dukbokki that you can order at Seoul Restaurant; you can get dukbokki mixed with ramyuen, dukbokki with beef, and etc.  However, when you have a hard time choosing between two very popular items (jajangmyeun and dukbokki), why not just mash them up together into a delicious mess?  It was mind-blowing to say the least. In place of the regular, red and spicy sauce you get with dukbokki, the jajang dukbokki uses the black bean sauce that is common in jajangmyeun.  This adds a deeper flavour to the dish than what you get with normal dukbokki.  Plus, it can be a little difficult for some to finish the entirety of a regular dukbokki dish because of how spicy it can get after the first three initial bites.  Therefore, the jajang version is right up the alley for anyone who wants to finish a dukbokki dish on their own or prefers a meatier sauce that is only mildly spicy.  Seoul Restaurant's chef also ensures that there are a lot of noodles woven along with the rice cakes, tofu skins, and egg.  Of course, you can always get noodles when you order ramyuen dukbokki, but the jajang dukbokki has a type of noodle that complements the jajang sauce very well - they're tender, chewy, and in all honesty, I could eat two of these dishes if I had the stomach space for it.  On the side, the kimbap was decent; it was nothing memorable.  The kimbap pieces were large in size, which is a plus, but I found that the fillings were not as flavourful as the kimbaps from Royal Boonsik, the Manna, and other small Korean mom and pop shops.  When dipped into the jajang sauce, they're not bad as a filler.   I have not tried too many dishes at Seoul, albeit having been there twice.  A staple is still the jajang dukbokki, however.   I highly recommend it, as it's quite mouth-watering!    Seoul restaurant is fine for hanging out with friends or for a simple date (not the first date)."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for.   The reason I gave this a four star despite the average taste is that their Gam Ja Tang is just $7!   First the taste. They gave me a very spicy one maybe because I wrote in Korean. It was borderline not eatable although it might be might fault for looking and writing in Korean. Also they serve white rice which is surprising for me because when I eat in Korean its usually black mixed rice. Appetizers are OK as well, typical servings on Korean restaurants.  Second is the price in which it really shines. For $7 you got a big pork bone soup which is meaty and six kinds of appetizers which are refillable. No Korean restos have offered such price. Quality is not bad and quantity is really good for that price point .  Overall I will be back if I'm on budget but not when I want something more special."}
{"text":"You can get a sense how good a Korean restaurant is just based on their Kimchi. 5/5 service 1/5 food Surprisingly, this place has taken a downturn. Only Pork Bone soup is somewhat okay in flavor. The soup no longer as good as before. 1-2 piece cabbage. Kimchi looks month old and tastes dry. Cannot even compare to supermarket Kimchi from any average chinese supermarket like T&T.  Kimchi Fried Rice, once the shining gem of the menu here, tasted awkwardly sour, with hints of chocolate powder???  GG. Meanwhile, down the street to the west is a new Korean restaurant, saw sign where porkbone soup same price comes with free can of pop. WIll try that place next."}
{"text":"The best and the most lovely Korean Restaurant on Bloor K-Town."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on the high Yelp ratings and was not disappointed. I got to taste the budae jjigae and kkanpungi. The kkanpungi was one of the best I've had - relatively crispy despite the sauce and not overly sweet with a nice kick of heat. I also liked being able to order a smaller portion instead of the $20 behemoths elsewhere.  The budae jjigae was one of my reasons for coming here, because I wanted to try it and couldn't convince anyone to go in on a 2-person serving elsewhere. I would have liked a bit more cheese, but it was fantastic. Lots of goodies, and if anything it was heavy on the sausage. It was definitely spicy but wow, so flavorful and tasty.  My dining companion had the dolsot bibimbap and said it was great, although they inhaled it and I didn't get to verify.  Very convenient location (walking distance from Bathurst Station), extremely reasonable prices, varied menu, and they take card. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Un bon petit resto, rempli de locaux!   On y mange bien, on est très bien servi, avec attention. J'y retournerai sans problème!  Les toilettes sont nikel chrome!(c'est important ça aussi dans un restaurant!)"}
{"text":"It's good service and great food as usual since I came here first time in 2011.... server boy so be humbled as always. Def will come back again."}
{"text":"A very simple Korean restaurant serving very homey food at an incredible cheap price! They might just have the most flavourful and cheapest pork bone soup in korea town ($7 gets you a huge portion that can easily be shared between two people). They also serve a selection of stews to share which can easily feed three to four people.  There is an unlimited supply of side dishes (you just have to ask). The waiters are not the most attentive but there is only one waiter in charge of the whole restaurant he visibly tries hard to serve everyone quickly and efficiently.    Overall, everyone in the restaurant, from the waiters in front to the lovely cooks in the back seem to put in a lot of effort to deliver good food at a cheap price and at a reasonable pace."}
{"text":"Came with a coworker to have the gamjatang that I was craving.  I have to say that I was pretty disappointed.  the flavour isn't there.  It was more sour than hot or spicy.  The colour was a bit off putting.  It was almost fusia.  We came during the week on a cold day and I really wanted that piping hot soup but it wasn't fully hot.  I'm used to gamjatang arriving boiling at my table.  The place was no frills but the prices are actually a little bit higher than what I'm used to with Korean food.  The restaurant was pretty empty when we got there.  My coworker ordered the bulgogi which came with rice.  It looked like a typical bulgogi, nice portion but once again, nothing to rave home about.  Her Bulgogi looked kinda grey.  What I did like is the access to utensils in these nice boxes table side.  There was no need to ask for them from the staff.  I might give them another chance but I think I will have to try the other dishes outside my gamjatang."}
{"text":"Dduk Bokki is one of my favourite things to eat in Korean cuisine. They're essentially stir fried rice cakes (very chewy) in a spicy sauce featured with fish cake, korean vermicelli and vegetables. And at Seoul Restaurant you get a generous (reaaaaally generous) portion of this dish for $6. Yar!!   Also, when I wanted this dish for take-out it literally took just three minutes to get it ready. Hot and Fresh and Ready to GO! They put it in a plastic bag within the styrofoam container such that none of the sauce'd spill. Ingenious, I'd say.  It's cheap, delicious and very much like home-cooking. The rest of the menu is pretty much the same. Prices range from $6-$8 (this all includes tax); this does preclude those listed under \"Hot Pan.\"   The restaurant is very simple so, it's great for a casual lunch/dinner. You'll be pleased to find that their menu is excellently written: there is Korean with English translation along with a description of the dish you're about to order."}
{"text":"The Seoul Restaurant serves good Korean food at good prices.  For $6 or $7 you can get a decently sized meal with rice or noodles.  Hot Pot is for more than one person, and obviously costs more.  If I could remember the name of my favourite dishes, I'd post them, but unfortunately the dishes are not named in English.  The staff was friendly, albeit a bit shy, a quality that always surprises me in a restaurant, but I don't bring attention to that fact to mark it as a negative.  They were always quick with the service and around when you needed them.    Unfortunately, for you to get service, or a refill of water, or tea, or the bill, you have to get their attention.  Again, some people like that, but some people aren't used to it.  My first time there, my friends and I sat with finished plates for a good while before we realized the procedure of this place.  Calling ahead for takeout was another idea I had later on that always turned out well.  Overall a decent place and worth trying at least once."}
{"text":"This place is another little spot in k-town which serves delicious Korean cuisine. The place is tight though with very limited seating, but we arrived around 730 on a Sunday with 9 people and managed to get a table.   We ordered several dishes which I felt were all very good and pricing was very good as well. They actually have korean hot pot too.   They have unlimited sides like most korean restaurants. The tea tasted very watery and you have to ask them to refill it constantly otherwise they wont automatically refill your tea which was slightly problematic with our group size since one pitcher for 9 ppl couldnt even get a round of tea for everyone.   I recommend this place. Food is good and cheap."}
{"text":"This is an establishment like so many others in this part of town. In an area so full of competitors serving the same thing, these guys manage to survive year after year thanks to their no frills approach. Is there better around? yes. Are they the cheapest? no. But if you're just looking for good old school Korean food, tasty and simple, these guys have it.  All your favourites are here from kamjatang to bulgogi, soon tofu...etc. Most, if not all are flavourful and tasty. There's not much that stands out here as great or bad but everything is good. Service is fast and effective and they only take cash.  I can't quite give them 5 stars because you can definitely find a better Korean meal nearby for a little cheaper even. Also, their appetizers (despite it being free) are kinda weak. Eat here if the other Korean joints nearby are closed."}
{"text":"With the seemingly never-ending number of restaurants to choose from, picking where to eat in Koreatown can be difficult; I've tried most of the Korean options and this place is a standout. The food is great, portions are generous, and our waiter was super nice and accommodating - what more can you ask for?  We ordered off the combo special menu and got combo 1 w/ kimbap & dduk bokki and combo 3 w/ fish cake soup & ra bokki. For $11 and $13, respectively, the combos are a really good deal; portion sizes for the rice cake dishes were huge and both the kimbap and fish cake soup were incredibly tasty, not to mention relatively hard to find at a lot of other Korean restaurants. The fish cake soup in particular was a favourite of mine - so simple but so savoury and flavourful! If you're not that hungry, you could probably split one combo between two people (I ended up packing most of my dduk bokki to go).  Simple, delicious food at low prices - I can see this place becoming my go-to for when I'm in Koreatown. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot. It's the best boon shik \"restaurant\",in the whole KTown.  The word Boon Shik translates into \"food made from flour\" and  refers to quickly made, snack - like foods, most closely resembling fast food in western society. Some examples of Boon Shik food include noodleand broth based things like gok su, Ramyun and rice based things like Ddukbokki, labbokki. It's quite popular among students because they are usually cheap and have group/fun  element ( like \"instantly cooking on the spot\") and  It's my favourite kind of food - all time favourite being ddukbokki - the spice rice cakes.The places usually are dingy and lacks any sort of decor - since it's usually a family business trying to make ends meet -  but delicious, cheap Korean food live in Boon Shik...Usually.   A good sign of that is that it's always full - I have been here at various times of the day and there is always a group of people.  The service is almost exceptional for a boon shik, and I tend to tip heavily because of it.  I tried the Pork Bone Soup here...and it's just so delicious.....there's a lot of food, and I assume that since it's not the popular choice here the pork gets more boiling time....which dissolves the cartilage of the meat a bit, adding more flavour to the soup....and the meat just melts alway in your mouth. The broth is  good, it's like meat soup !! YUM. Of  course, Owl of Minava is still superior when it comes to flavour, but this is pretty close.  They have good selection of combo choices where you can get 2 dishes for under $10. They have the Jun Gol (hotpot type meals) which is perfect for 2 or more people to share......I LOVE the Ddukbokki + whatever combo here for $9.  So much better than the \"Thumbs up\" place just 2 doors down.....but what do I know. I'm just a Korean who happens to have an addiction to food."}

{"text":"So it was quite crowded when I came with my girlfriend and there was only one waiter. I felt so bad for him, he was still clearing tables when we came and he kept apologizing for the mess but I reassured him that it was alright. Even with a huge crowd, the service didn't lack. Most of our orders almost immediately after we ordered well my orders came before my girlfriend's LOL. The waiter gave us an order sheet where we wrote down on the sheet what we wanted. I ordered Ddukbokki and Kimchi Hae Mool Pajeon (my usual when I come)  while my girlfriend ordered Jjuu Mandoo? (I don't know, cut me some slack here) and Kimchi Bokkumbap. At the end, our bill came to a total of $26 which in my opinion is not bad compared to other places that overcharge for meal items that are considered a snack/light lunch and left $2.80 for the waiter (Kudos to him for the stress he was experiencing)  Pros: - Food comes piping hot from the kitchen - Best ddukbokki ever! (Tasted authentic unlike Thumbs Up where the sauce was runny like water. The sauce was a nice balance of sweet and spicy) - Waiter was able to work under stress and spoke fluent Korean and English   Cons: - GET MORE WAITERS! (Seriously)"}
{"text":"Very cheap korean food on bloor. They have very good selections of korean food. I ordered combo (rice cake and kimbab) and bibimbap and could not finish them. Very friendly staff. Recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Given the hot weather, it's only fitting to review this place for their \"mul naeng myeon\", or cold buckwheat noodle soup.  Perhaps to offset the notion that all Korean dishes must be served at near molten temperatures under constant exposed flame, this bowl of noodle soup is chilled with large chunks of ice (yes, floating in your soup), in a stainless steel bowl.  You'll find your standard buckwheat noodles (it's not unusual to ask for scissors if you find the noodles difficult to manage), along with thin slices of beef, radish, and other veg. It's a decent meal, and a fantastic way to cool-off and fill-up on a hot day.  The real kicker though is the two sauces you're provided to augment the flavour profile of the broth. You'll get white vinegar and a mustard sauce reminiscent of diluted wasabi (and by all means ask for this if it isn't proffered). Both applied in tandem, the sauces kick up your soup to a new level, and I find the mustard sauce totally addictive. Beware though, as the wasabi-style heat of this has a way of dropkicking you in the head as you near the bottom of the bowl."}
{"text":"Good not great! The place is definitely here because of food, not ambiance.   My pork bone soup was delicious, just how it is other great places,   soft tofu, seafood stew is delicious (though, you have to like seafood, as it has a strong seafood presence...which is a good thing, though not if you dislike seafood),   dukk and dumpling soup was meh, should have been warmer and mad more dumplings and the soup was nothing to brag about (hence the three stars).   Service is...having to flag down the staff, but you do get Korean side dishes free!"}
{"text":"Huge portions. I ordered the beef bokkeumbap and bulgogi dukbokki. I feel like the fried rice had a certain \"oil\" taste to it that I wasn't a fan of, but overall the food was really good.   The banchan could have been better, but oh well.   AND THERE IS NO TAX (or tax is included in the price)!!!"}
{"text":"My go to place for korean food! Don't be catch off guard by seeing it empty,  the food is really good! I have been here about 3 times and everything I got was really good! We get free side dishes and tea! My favorite dishes here are the cold noodles,  kimbap and jeon!"}
{"text":"This has been one of my go-to places in Koreatown since 2008, and they've never let me down. I get the seafood pancake and kimchi stew every time.  Don't want to diss Kachi but I don't understand why people love it so much, this place is so much better."}
{"text":"Another Korean restaurant that I actually love. This is a gem in the very busy street of Bloor. We ordered the Bibimbap and Pork Bone Soup and I the are delicious! Comes with several side dishes that are equally satisfying and flavourful.   I came here a lot of times and this is my first review for this place. I enjoyed my every visit."}
{"text":"This place used to be my go-to spot for take-out gimbap before heading to work (I've since quit my job).   It's a simple square-shaped Korean restaurant filled with basic chairs and tables. It's clearly a family-owned place with only a couple younger waiters. Despite the simple setting the food and service is great!  The service is really friendly, although I can imagine them getting pretty overwhelmed if it ever gets busy in there since there seems to be only one person serving at a time.  I've had plenty of their gimbap  and each time it has been consistently tasty. I've also had some of their ddeokboggi  and raboggi , and have been satisfied each time.  I'm not sure what their meat is like, but they don't seem have the proper tables for good BBQ (perhaps an ignorant bias on my part). But this is definitely the perfect place to get the fast food version of Korean food.  If you're feeling like a casual but delicious lunch, this is the place to go. The waiters are friendly and the food is consistently delicious."}
{"text":"I recommend this restaurant. The food is great, you get side dish refills as mush as you want. They are very friendly and the food is tasty and very good prices. We had dinner for two with tip for 20 dollars. We go at least once a week. The combos are good, sometimes I like the kimball as a separate. Thank you all there"}
{"text":"This is a bunsik place. Food tasted pretty much what you may get average bunsik places in Korea. Someone said the jiajangmyun here is good and I could not find a place that specializes in korean chinese near christie so I took my friends here. The noodle is same as the kalguksu which we also got. The sauce is what you would get at hyugyesos ()s on the highway. Was not pleased. Size is good though. Kalguksu was decent. Much better than jiajiangmyun. The steamed dumplings were just not that good. The fillings lack favor. Texture of skins not that great."}
{"text":"The omurice really wasn't as great as I expected, it was just an omelete over some plain fried rice with prob frozen veggies. My friend had chicken katsu which she thought was pretty delicious. We also had manjus, they were pretty good ( a bit oily)"}
{"text":"I'm on a quest to find the best pork bone soup in the city.   Seoul Sam Mi was the next place on my list to scout out. (It's always busy - that's a good sign in K-town. There are so many dining options in K-town and I've never gone wrong by picking one that is full of people).  Seoul Sam Mi was a bit more spacious inside than some of the other places in the hood. Decor is simple with red and black tables/chairs and wooden benches that line either side. It has a nice homey feel and I liked that I could see over into the kitchen and watch the cooks preparing the food.  The pork bone soup had a really lovely coloured broth, nicest I've seen so far, bright and orange. The meat was perfect, not overcooked (Kachi across the road is sometimes guilty of this). Huge piece of potato and lots of cabbage. It wasn't as spicy as usual. This would be good for people who can't handle much spice. I personally love spice, so I will be back to try it out - this time requesting it extra spicy. They might have dumbed-down the spice assuming I was a white girl who might not be able to handle it.  Had it been spicier I think it would have been my favourite pork bone soup yet.  Service was fast and friendly. Side dishes were good but nothing out of the norm for your average Korean place. Props to the waiter for giving me a giant extra cold bottle of water which I guzzled.  Some people next to me were eating the hot pot and I have to admit, it looked pretty bad ass."}
{"text":"Gamjatang (pork bone soup) was terrible. It had the orange grease taste to it - do you know what I'm talking about? It's like the congealed orange grease that stains everything and tastes plastic. Sounds appetizing? Yeah.   Anyways, one thing they DO well here though is their table cooking. They bring out individual gas stoves and they have giant cooking pans where they cook your food in broth. It's good for cold nights out; it's nothing spectacular or special, but it does the job of filling your tummy with warm food that's reasonably tasty.  Cost? Meh.  Probably cus the food is also meh.  Come back again? Probably not."}
{"text":"Greatly enjoy the food here. Consistent quality been coming back for 10 years. Use to go to Harbord C.I. I recommend the spicy bulgogi with squid."}
{"text":"normal wait time, appetizers weren't something but main courses were good. my black bean sauce rice and fish cake with bulgogi was a bit too salty and very filling and husband said his bibimbap was even better than in Sunrise house. good and polite service, would be back."}
{"text":"It saddens me to write a bad review for this place. I've been going to Seoul Restaurant for a few years. It has an extensive menu that can satisfies a lot of Korean food cravings, but I always go here for the \"cook yourself/hot pot\" pork bone soup. It used to be $20 (incl tax) for 2, which was such a great deal! We had not been back for awhile, but tonight we decided to go back for dinner. They increased the price to $24. It makes sense. When it used to be only $20 for 2, I felt like I was ripping them off (but I always made sure I tipped generously ~ 15-20%). Anyway, the food came pretty quick (as usual), but we're having an issue with the portable stove. It wouldn't turn on. So the guy switched the gas, turned the knob to ON again, and left. Didn't bother to even check that the stove it's still not ON! We had to flag him to come back and check what's wrong. Problem was solved and we started eating away... only to realize that we hadn't even been served water. So we flagged the guy again and asked for water. He came with a jug of water... with no cups. DUH???? Flagged another guy who also worked there and asked for 2 cups. He brought the cups, but didn't even say sorry that they completely forgot our water. After we finished our meal, my fiance went to the front to pay. I was still sitting at the table and one of the guys started clearing up the table. Excuse me, was I invisible to him? My fiance went back to the table looking pretty annoyed. He asked me to leave 75cents on the table. I was confused. I thought he would have included the tip when he paid for the bill. Once we're out, he explained to me that he tipped them just under 10% because of what happened earlier. Poor service, less tip. As simple as that. But the guy had the nerve to ask him for more tip (\"we need at least a 10% tip\"). My fiance told the guy the reason why he only tipped so much was because of the bad service we received earlier... for which the guy only said \"Sorry\".  This place used to have one of the best food and service in Korean town. But after what happened tonight, we will never go back."}
