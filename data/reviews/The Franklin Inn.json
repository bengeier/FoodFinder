{"text":"Great waitress, great food except Taco's, service outstanding, price just okay. Noise with groups. But we will return, and soon!"}
{"text":"The one star was earned by the tasty margarita, the food however, is aweful.  My chicken enchilada consisted of over boiled chicken in a flour tortilla covered in Kraft cheddar cheese.  No sauce!! The bean burrito was slightly more flavorful with blackbeans and FETA cheese.  Apparently, they knew there was some sort of white cheese in Mexican food but never heard of queso blancho, so they figured Greek feta would work. It doesn't. If you're in the area and you're looking for a place to grab a drink, this place would probably do, but don't go there expecting good food."}
{"text":"I just moved to Pittsburg and have eaten there twice now. I had the Chiles Rellenos the first time and the Chicken Enchilada with Colorado Green Chile the second. Both were quite good.  I find the food there more variable and more enjoyable than the chain restaurants.  The margaritas are quite good and reasonably priced, especially if you get a pitcher. It is crowded on Friday nights but you can hang in the bar and sip your first margarita while you wait.  Overall, I think it's very enjoyable and will definitely go there more."}
{"text":"This is a fun cozy little place in the suburbs with a \"15 minutes of fame\" story. It was one of the sets for the movie Dogma. See if you recognize it. :) It's up in the North Hills and despite it's country name - it's actually a Mexican restaurant. The food is cheap and pretty good. There aren't any \"great\" Mexican places in Pittsburgh, so don't expect that Neither is it always the best service on busy nights. Nice, just not \"fast\". HOWEVER...and this is where the 5 stars comes in...in my opinion, the BEST no-frills Margarita in Pittsburgh. They have a separate bar that's almost the same size as the dining room. There's also a big front patio so you can camp while you wait for your table. Chances are, if you have an hour wait in front of you like we did one Friday night - 20 minutes with your new best friend the Mason Jar Margarita will make sure you really don't care how long you wait. They are available in two sizes (Stick with the smaller one if you don't want to be seeing double enchiladas at dinner)."}
{"text":"I could probably eat Mexican food every day of the week because I love it so much, but I would never go back here! There's a reason why it's called Franklin inn and they serve Mexican food- worst Mexican I've had in my life. The food was bland, the salsa was sour. My husband asked if they can make this meal spicy and the waitress brought over Chula sauce. Service was okay. All the workers there seem to hang out in the back of the restaurant and drink. Thought I would try this place because co workers said it was good but I Would never go back."}
{"text":"This place is great, the food is tasty, the beer selection is good and reasonably priced, and the staff is friendly and attentive. There are only two drawbacks to the restaurant and they are that the bar is too small and frequently standing room only and that they do not have enough glasses. Nobody wants an ice cold beer poured into a hot glass straight from the washer. Don't get me wrong a cold beer in dirty glass would be worse. While I understand that you just can't add to a building overnight it wouldn't be too difficult to up the amount of glasses in circulation."}
{"text":"Everything is always fresh and delicious! I am a big fan of the fajitas and guacamole. Have heard people rave about the wings, will have to try them next time we go! I also enjoy a margarita at happy hour on occasion :-) The staff is always friendly and responsive. Can't say enough good things!"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were good. Guacamole was bland and boring. The rest of the food was unremarkable. Could be any generic Mexican place."}
{"text":"This is definitely not authenic Mexican food!   Go to Patrons if you want some good Mexican food!  I don't know what people see in this place!  It was packed.  Their were alot of families with their kids in there which makes me think that it's a cheap place to feed your kids.  They wouldn't know good Mexican food if it reached up and bit them!  Their rice was not like any kind of rice I've ever ate at a Mexican restaurant.  It was loaded with garlic and not tomatoey at all.  It was disgusting!   Yes, they do give you big portions but I fix better enchiladas at home!  The service was slow and are waiter was goofy acting.  I don't know what his problem was unless he was smoking a doobie in the restroom!"}
{"text":"My family eats here probably about once a month. For a while, we felt like the quality of the food was headed downhill, but I am writing this review because over the last 2 months, we feel like the quality and presentation is again on the upswing. The plating is better, and there is a sense of freshness to some new menu items. We want to encourage whatever is happening in the kitchen to continue happening.   The service for us has always been on the very casual side, but friendly. This is a pretty small place, so if you come with a large party, you may have to wait a while, as there are not that many tables.   The traditional margaritas are pretty good, and we like the pineapple ones even better. Give Franklin Inn a try again if you haven't in a while."}
{"text":"The Franklin Inn is a small restaurant and bar that is frequently crowded but well worth the wait.The food is very good and the margaritas even better. They have daily specials at a good price and value. I highly recommend this place and make sure you have the freshly made chips and salsa..Fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Average food, terrible service.   That about sums up this restaurant.  First the service, it is terrible. From the moment you walk in the door and have a long wait in a tiny waiting area (even if you used the no-wait app), to the time you sit down and are ignored or treated rudely.  Second: the food is simply average.  Pittsburgh has better Mexican restaurants food (and service wise) in Patrone and many others.  Save your time and money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My favorite watering hole!  They make the BEST margarita in town!  I am also a big fan of their Green Chile Enchilada and fajitas. Their potato pepper soup is delicious also."}
{"text":"Quite a great, somewhat off the beaten path, gem. Would you like a properly great marguerita? Check! Great meals that are made with very fresh ingredients? Check! Did I mention the marguerita?! Friendly staff, friendly crowd, very comfortable and one of my favorite places. Could we just not tell too many people please?!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about Franklin Inn Mexican Restaurant! They catered our wedding reception Saturday and the food was delicious. All of our guests loved it! Chris was extremely professional and easy to work with and prices were very reasonable. I'd definitely recommend them for your next event!  Also an awesome place to go sit down and eat. I recommend the mole."}
{"text":"Really?  I do not understand some of these reviews.  The food here is quite good and the 'ritas?  My God, yes they are not cheap, but they are huge and very generous w/ the alcohol.  Anyhow, the wings at this place are incredible and like nothing at any other place.  Bank on it!"}
{"text":"The place itself is extremely small, but the food was AWESOME. Great margaritas.  A little out of the way but definitely worth seeking our"}
{"text":"I met here with some friends for dinner on Saturday night. My friends got here about 15 minutes before me at 5:30 and were told the wait would be 20-25 minutes. We had no problem with this!  Fast forward to 6:30... We are still waiting for a seat. We've asked the hostess multiple times, you know in case we got lost in the shuffle somehow, but no our table is supposedly next. At this point we've debated back and forth about just ordering food to-go and going back to someone's house to eat or just leaving and going somewhere else, but when told there is just 1 party ahead of you and then you are next to be seated it doesn't really make sense to leave at that point when you've put the time in. And we were by no means a large party, we were a table of 4 with a high chair and we had told the hostess if it would get us seated quicker we'd skip the highchair and just hold the baby.  About 6:45 our party of 5 went to 3, the baby was just too tired. And we finally got seated at 7:15. The wait was absolutely ridiculous. I completely understand a wait on a Saturday night, but don't quote us less than 30 minutes and it end up being an almost 2 hour wait. Over estimate the wait in the future, so you have customers who are pleasantly surprised when the wait isn't as long as told.  The food itself was very good, but I also could have been delusional from hunger. We had the cheese cilantro and an order of wings to start, because we destroyed the basket of chips in minutes. The cheese cilantro was much better then basic fried cheese sticks, the Monterey Jack cheese is extra gooey. The hot wings were delicious! The spiciness was like a slow good burn. I completely understand why our one friend ordered 2 full orders of wings for dinner.  For dinner I had the pineapple poblano pork burrito. The salsa was delicious, so good next time I would if I could have extra salsa inside the burrito and on the side."}
{"text":"Have been going to the Franklin Inn for years!!!!  You can NOT beat the food and service!  The black bean burrito with feta cheese was my favorite BUT two nights ago I had the new chicken salad on the menu.  It was amazing!   Between the chicken, corn, and black beans along with the jalape√±o pepper cilantro dressing the flavors blend so perfectly with just the right amount of heat!  Of course there are the great chips and signature salsa to begin the meal as well.  If you have never been to the Franklin Inn you are missing a real Pittsburgh treasure.  If you have... you already know how fantastic it is!"}
{"text":"The Franklin Inn is a pretty weird spot, it's in a neighborhood. The food is pretty good. It's always busy which is a good sign of the quality of the food. The margaritas are awesome and the food  portions are pretty  large. I wish that they would have an option for a smaller amount of queso because I end up eating the whole bowl full. Get the taco salad"}
{"text":"probably my favorite queso cheese dip in the Pittsburgh area. Also make the best margarita in the city!!!! Who can pass that up??"}
{"text":"We drove quite a way to check this place out because we're from Texas and we really miss mexican food.  The food was not good and when I asked for some queso, I literally got a bowl of microwaved cheddar cheese that hardened within two minutes. It was sooo disgusting and such a letdown. I tried to stir it up with a spoon, and it stuck literally straight up in the solidified \"queso\". Ugh!"}
{"text":"We had a larger party on a busy Saturday night. Our waitress was amazing and so patient. Despite the crowd and number of people in our group, the food was served promptly. I had the chicken tacos with fajita veggies and rice. The food was ok. The chicken was moist but lacked an flavor, while the rice was overly mushy. It tasted like it was sitting in a container for some time.   Someone in our party had ordered wings. The chicken was very good, but extremely spicy. I would try the Franklin Inn again, but not order the chicken."}
{"text":"We went on a recommendation from a neighbor....... The food was absolutely terrible!  From the salsa and the guacamole we ordered to the entrees. I ordered the shredded beef chimichanga. It came in a ball. Pot roast rolled in a shell. No Mexican flavors. The rice was Rice A Roni veggie mix and I don't know what the beans were. Dry, hard and in a mound. Stood my fork up in them. Hub ordered the chorizo/potato stuffed poblano. It was blanketed in what looked like American cheese slices and the potatoes were raw. We each took two bites. Waitress was oblivious. Kept asking if we wanted \"to go\" containers. Never, ever asked why we didn't eat anything. Took our 10lb plates to throw away. THIS IS NOT MEXICAN FOOD!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A \"can't miss\" local restaurant with Corona Light on tap,  great service and excellent food!!"}
{"text":"I am really surprised by all of the bad reviews on here. I have heard amazing things about the Franklin Inn for years. We tried it for the first time recently, and it was basic PA \"Mexican\" food. The best items we had were from the specials menu, they seemed a little more authentic than what was on the menu. The place itself is a little divey, but not bad, the drinks were way expensive, so be careful there."}
{"text":"Amazing experience!   Ignore  negative reviews if older unless it is about the wait. It was explained to me that the ownership has passed down to the son who hired more professional chefs. The wait is really long (1 hour+) so use no wait app. If you come by the time it tells you to check in then the wait should be about 15 minutes.  Good beer and alcohol selection. Great food. Try the mole enchiladas. Lot of seafood for the Lenten season. Daily specials. Try the hot wings. The salsa and the wings are spicy.  Also, the chef comes out to explain the menu to you and make suggestions. It makes you feel important. He is very nice and he explained why some of the reviews were bad, despite the long wait. He smiled and said well we are jam  packed everyday. He said a lot of things are being made in house. Seems to me that he is in control of the kitchen and fixing things.  I encourage everyone to at least give this place one try and ignore the reviews. What have you got to lose? All of the other Mexican places in the area are so so at best."}
{"text":"I used to come to the Franklin Inn all the time, but the last time I was here was the first in over a year.  The Franklin Inn used to be my FAVORITE restaurant.  I am not sure if maybe it was just an off night, or if things have changed, or if my tastes have changed. I would still call it good, though I may be biased, but a little bit closer to the \"fine\" end of the spectrum.   It's a cute place heavily decorated with Mexican souvenirs, artwork, masks, etc.  The waitstaff was different from those I had gotten to know when I was younger but everyone is very nice.  I was a bit confused about the wait for a table even though there were clearly a few empty tables in the dining area.   They seem to change their chips every time I'm there, but they were good. I have gotten them alone to go in the past.  I got the taco salad (as I almost always do-I love the fried tortilla bowl!). The proportion of chicken(you could also get beef if you preferred):lettuce ratio is -always pretty heavy on the meat (getting my money's worth). I think it was the dressing that didn't taste the same as I remembered. I also got a margarita, which was just as good as I remembered :)"}
{"text":"We have been to this place a few times and the quality depends on the server and cook that evening. Some experiences have been really good & some not so good.  I'm going to describe my latest trip there two weeks ago since it is most current. We used the no wait app, which malfunctioned that day yet Franklin Inn still had a table waiting for us. For that we were really grateful since it was a busy evening. That's where the enjoyment ended.  We waited a really long time for anyone to come to the table. She finally did & took our drink order. Then we waited a long time again. I nicely told her we were ready to order when she was. She turned around really angry and said that she was waiting on our drinks and couldn't wait on us until they were ready which made no sense especially since she kept going to all the tables around us. She finally brought our drinks and took our order 20 minutes after sitting down.  The drinks were not good. I had a classic blue margarita that had an awful flavor. My husband had a Moscow Mule that also was horrible.  I had the chorizo burrito, which I had in the past and was good. This time the chorizo was way overdone and had too much filler in it. Not good at all. The fajita veggies were underdone and disgusting. My husband had an enchilada that was also awful. We didn't bother to tell the waitress because she was mad I asked her to take our order and ignored us all night because of it.  There are too many good places in Pittsburgh that have good food and service to go back here."}
{"text":"Surprising for a mexican restaurant but Franklin Inn has the best wings in Pittsburgh. Great selection of rotating drafts too. Small inside which can cause a bit of a wait to get a seat though."}
{"text":"When being seated, you are given free chips and salsa. Now, while this may seem like a minor detail, these chips and salsa are gonna tell you a whole lot about your experience here....  See, people either despise or adore this salsa, and whichever stance you take on this spicy tomato deliciousness will most likely be inductive of your stance on the restaurant as a whole.  If you couldn't tell already- let me just say that I love me some Franklin Inn. It may not be the best or the cheapest, but I'll be damned if it isn't some of the most satisfying grub in the North Hills.  Location is right off Oakleaf Lane, a smallish odd looking little building with a gravel parking lot. Honestly not too impressive, decor revealing it's hole-in-the-wall status. This place gets BUSY weekend nights, and is a local hang out, if you're from the area you are guaranteed to see at least several people you know on any trip.  Menu is exactly what you would expect, typical Mex-American fare, nothing too outrageous or notable. The Mexican Burger is about as original or inventive that any of the dishes get, so don't expect bold new strides in culinary artistry.  Recommended item: Fajitas of any variety (steak, veggie, chicken, shrimp, etc). The dish comes out sizzzzling hot, the meat is well cooked and seasoned, and the peppers and onions have that ever-so-slight crunch intact that adds so much satisfaction to the dish.  As for rest of the food, it's nothing much to write home about really, save for a few dishes that stand out from the crowd. This being said, no matter what item I order, I always end up leaving full and satisfied. There is definitely some kind of weird force at work there, but I always leave feeling great about what I just ate.   Also of note are the margaritas. Definitely give them a shot. They taste like the firey slurpee mix of a Mexican sun devil. In all the best ways.  Overall, it's a fairly polarizing place with it's fair share of love and hate. You're not going to know which side of the spectrum you fall on until you give it a try yourself. Either way with absolute confidence I can say \"I told you so!\"  Franklin Inn 4/5"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the Franklin Inn last night for dinner.  The food was excellent, but the noise level was raucous.  My wife ordered the seafood enchiladas and received two nicely filled rolled corn tortillas stuffed with baby shrimp and other seafood, covered in a white, creamy cheese sauce. I had the cheese and onion enchiladas that were full of cheese and onions and very flavorful.  The Inn is fairly small, and at dinner time, gets busy very quickly.  Our waitress was pleasant and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in the mood for Mexican, and we wanted to go somewhere new.  The Franklin Inn came up in a search for Mexican restaurants, so we decided to give it a try.  I called prior to arriving to make sure they served alcohol.  When I called, I spoke with an extremely rude female employee who treated me as if I was stupid.  I explained to her that it was my first time and I wanted to make sure they served alcohol.  She then said to me, 'Are there even restaurants that don't serve alcohol?'    When we arrived the customer service continued to be horrible.  The hostess was on her phone and acted as if my boyfriend and I were bothersome.  Our waitress was also not good.  We heard her talking to other employees about she couldn't wait to leave and get 'wasted.'  She was also not attentive and I had to ask on more than one occasion for a refill.   The food was also not good.  I wouldn't say horrible, I have had worse, but it was nothing to make up for the customer service.  Overall, this is not a restaurant I will be returning to or recommending.  Being a frequent restaurant go-er and a manager at an upscale retail store, customer service is just as important to me as the quality of the food.  This place was a failure and disappointment."}
{"text":"Best Mex in Pittsburgh.   Margaritas are phenomenal.  Staff and mgmt are great.  Food is fantastic."}
{"text":"Had a wonder dinner here on a Tuesday night.  The hostess said there was a 20 minute wait but it actually turned out to be only 5 minutes.  Killed those 5 minutes with a Green Flash single hop pale ale.  Ordered the mole chicken enchiladas for my main which was great with a side order of the fresh roasted jalape√±os!!!  The advertised ghost chilis fresh salsa was did not include ghost chilis but I'll give them a pass as it was fairly late in the evening.  All in all, a very solid Mexican dinner..."}
{"text":"So, I'll give it this - it makes a mean black bean and feta burrito.  However, this is NOT a Mexican restaurant.  This is some sort of suburban poser restaurant.  There was almost nothing Mexican about it.  Besides the burrito I mentioned, the food was pretty horrible.  I asked for queso and instead they gave me a soup dish filled with some horrid grainy solidified cheddar.  I was absolutely horrified.  I would never go back, even for that burrito."}
{"text":"I've never posted a review...primarily because I have never felt strongly enough to post one that I felt would be useful another user...my wife and I dine out very often and decided to try taco/wing night at the Franklin Inn. The beef tacos are no different than an Old El Paso taco kit...beef seasoning, shredded cheese and cold thick flour tortillas...All the same as or worse than a kit...The wings were passable, we had to ask for menus, then to order, then chips, salsa, silverware, and napkins...most of which (or at least some of which is provided within a reasonable amount of time.) After we finally choked down as much as we could (we had been there for less than 45 min and ordered several drinks) a hefty blond lady came over and asked \"you done\".  I grew up in the service industry and feel for individuals who are having a tough night. This wasn't one of those evenings. There are at least 4 better Mexican options in the Wexford area. Go to one of them...or go to the grocery store and buy a taco kit"}
{"text":"Update: saw an employee wash there hands for not even 5 seconds let alone 20... the food was great but that ruined the whole experience. My old review is gone for some reason? One employee is the issue , but the restaurant needs to teach them the importance of being clean."}
{"text":"We ate here on the recommendation of a friend. Let me just say that friend got an earful from us! This place is the worst Mexican food I have ever had. The food tasted store bought and looks as if it was made seven hours ago. The rice was hard and tasted like it came out of a bag! The beans were stiff and over spiced. The enchiladas were dry. Never before have I been served an enchilada without enchilada sauce. Quite frankly I have had better Mexican food at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Magi magi tacos were great. Rice was a bit spicey and Luke warm. Food was very good. Seemed quite slow, but fresh cooked Tara time."}
{"text":"I ate at the Franklin Inn last night and ordered the shrimp fajitas, roughly a fifteen dollar entree that contained eight smallish shrimp.  My wife had the chicken fajitas and both were bland and served without rice and the typical sides (but they did add guac).  The atmosphere was so so but the wait staff was generally friendly, I simply cannot recommend when there are many other Mexican restaurants in the area of similar value and superior quality."}
{"text":"First time here over the weekend and loved it! Started with the queso, which was creamy and had just the right amount of spiciness. The chips were hot and fresh! I had grilled fish tacos, which are served un-assembled. Loved that I could make my own! The fish was flaky and mild. The rice was good but the best part was the slaw - the perfect mixture of spicy and sweet, and a great compliment to the fish! Hubby got a special \"pot pie\", which was loaded with fresh seafood and Mexican spices - and covered in a light, flaky biscuit-type shell. So different and tasty! We were too full for dessert, and were sad to say no to the homemade ice cream. Can't wait to go back! It's small, and we were there in between lunch and dinner so got seated right away. I'd guess there'd be a long wait at normal lunch or dinner hours."}
{"text":"Very good food over all, when quesadea arrived at the table some of the cheese was not melted al the way through, it was on a Friday night so I know they were busy and rushed."}
{"text":"Was the food good absolutely!  However ... I called a week ago and asked if they took reservations - the answer was No, that they were on the \"no wait\" app. At 5:40pm today I checked in on the app.  It said we had a 38-55 minute wait. We waited outside with drinks and chips and salsa.  After multiple complaints to management now that we had been waiting for 80 mins they insisted we were next in line to be seated!  Another 25 mins go by and we still hadn't been seated - they asked us to go to the bar and place our food order.  Insisting that there wasn't enough seating to put 5 of us together and gave us the option to sit apart - there were several empty tables through the restaurant - for heavens sake just put them together!!!!!  Once we we finally seated - the waiter was very nice and accommodating.  I will say this was a rather disappointing evening especially when it's a farewell dinner to friends you've been working with for 10 years.  The parking lot needs some serious work!  The bathrooms literally have one stall.  While the food is good ,  I will likely choose elsewhere the next time I want Mexican food!"}
{"text":"The Franklin Inn is an authentic suburban bar, Mexican restaurant, accent on bar. The food is decent Americanized Mexican, notable only as an excuse to drink the margaritas, which are pretty good, especially in volume. Prices are low, service acceptable, after the first large jar. If you remember the food the next morning, you missed the point."}
{"text":"We've been going to the Franklin Inn off and on (mostly on) for the past 20 years. The margaritas are incredible and the food is excellent. If you require good service don't bother. The only reason we don't frequent all the time is the service is no better than a 3-4 on a scale of 10. But the food and drinks generally make up for it. Occasionally a good server/bartender comes through. But the traditional service is less than adequate 90% of the time. Service rating is a 1 but the food/beverage is a 4 on a scale of 1-5."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try a different Mexican restaurant other than the usual options in the Pittsburgh area.  When we entered the establishment it wasn't very busy, but this is due to the time we visited the Franklin Inn which was around lunch time.   The restaurant did not seem very clean--the table behind us,  which was empty had food scattered all over the floor and the environment was kind of stale.   We were approached by a teenage girl who imediately took our drink order.  When we placed our order,  my husband ordered the taco meal.    She had to ask twice how many tacos he wanted when the menu clearly stated how many tacos you receive with the meal.  Once she walked away with our order,  within minutes she had to come back and ask again what sides he picked with his order.   We received our food and it poor at best.  The pinto beans obviously came from a can and the ground meat was terrible.  You would had received a better tasting meal going through the Taco Bell drive thru. To their credit,  the guacamole was very good,  but that was the only good tasting thing out of the meal.   It was difficult to get our drinks refilled and to get our check because our teenage waitress was too busy talking to a group of her friends that were also visiting the restaurant at the same time and was taking selfies with them!   Once her friends left,  she still did not acknowledge us and walked away.  I had to approach her with my credit card to pay the bill.  At that time,  she was texting. Poor food and service and I would not visit again."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been meaning to try The Franklin Inn for a while because we are still looking for a great Mexican spot in the North Hills (if you have any recommendations, feel free to let me know!). Franklin Inn has No Wait, which is a huge bonus and it always has a long wait, which seems like a good sign. The space itself has a great ambiance, great for a date night.  The chips and salsa were really good - keep in mind that you only get one basket. The service was super slow, but the restaurant was packed on a Friday night and the server was pleasant enough.  My husband had a beef burrito and he enjoyed it. I had the chicken fajitas. The fajita was okay, but seriously lacking in flavor and seasoning and the chicken was burnt. We may come back just for the ambiance,  but we would both try something new."}
{"text":"Ate dinner last night at Franklin Inn with my cousin. It was great to have a local restaurant and not a chain to eat at. Quick and friendly service allowed us to visit and chat. We started our meal with cold beers with the happy hour discount. Chips and their salsa were enjoyed while waiting for our main courses, loved the fresh taste of the salsa. Chips were thin and crisp. We bother enjoy their enchiladas with rice and refried beans. I had the Aztec winter special enchiladas and love the bits of onion through out them and they were covered with gooey cheddar cheese. My cousin had the shredded beef. Atmosphere was great and not too loud, so allowed for great conversation."}
{"text":"I've been going to The Franklin Inn as long as I can remember. Have I reviewed it before tonight? No? Oops.   My friend and I were planning on getting to The Franklin Inn around 7pm. Franklin uses the No Wait app, so I put our name as we drove there. The parking lot was packed when we got there, but luckily we got a spot. Once we checked in, we had to wait another ten minutes before we were seated. We got a table in the very back of the restaurant.   Our waitress was very friendly and asked if we wanted to started with some margaritas. I ordered a small frozen strawberry margarita - heads up.. their margaritas are strong. They put a least a few shots tequila in.. so I asked for half the tequila. My friend ordered a small lime margarita on the rocks.   They provide chips and salsa for free - the chips are delicious - but we ordered their queso, because I had never it before. It was interesting to say the least. We got the cheddar cheese - you can also get pepper jack cheese or add chorizo to it. It was good, but not like anything I've had before. It was unique and I liked it.   For my entree, I ordered the mini combination with 3 smaller portions and two sides. I ordered a chicken enchilada, a shredded beef enchilada, and a chicken taco with double rice. I asked for the Colorado green Chile sauce for the enchiladas, but they gave me a red sauce. I wasn't a fan of the sauce - a little too spicy for my liking. The rice was a little too bland.   Our waitress was prompt and asked us if we needed anything. I asked for more napkins and a side of sour cream- she brought them right away. She also asked us if we wanted more margaritas with our meals. Of course, we got them. It's 5'oclock somewhere right?   Overall, I enjoyed my evening at the Frank - but would definitely try something new next time around."}
{"text":"The margaritas are AHHH-MAZING! I go to Franklin inn just for these wonderful margaritas! They come served in a small and large mason jar, the large is great for two."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner and everything was perfect. The workers were very friendly and smiled a lot. Service was fast. They brought out chips and salsa and they were fresh and warm. Our drinks came soda and a ice tea. The waitress asked if we were ready and we said yes. We ordered the Seafood Enchilada it was very good. Then for dessert I had the fried ice cream. Everything was perfect."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican places in the North Hills! The parking lot and restaurant is on the small side with a small separate bar area. Get on the no wait app for the main dining room. Waits can be long during busy hours. I always get my favorite shrimp enchiladas and they never disappoint me. And we also get the steak fajitas another winner. Their Margaritas are by far the best Margarita you will have anywhere. The mason jars of them is the best way to go. But make sure you have a designated driver. These margaritas will give you a punch even if you only have one. The nachos they serve to everyone but fair warning we were told awhile back they use peanut oil. Thus the reason my daughter never goes with us here. The only problem is because of the small area it is extremely noisy and very hard to hear and the tables are so close together. Which is the reason they are not 5 star. I often wonder why they have not expanded or at least added a deck for the summer that they could enclose for the winter. Next time you want some great Mexican food and Margaritas head on over to the Franklin Inn."}
{"text":"This is a great Mexican restaurant.  The food is authetic and always seems fresh.  I have never been to the restuarant when it wasn't packed.  I have been there on a Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday.  The restaurant is small which doesn't help.  When you enter you are greated with a smile from the hostess who normally tells you there is a 20 minute wait...lol.  The bar area is also small and if there is a wait that probably means the bar is full.  You can order food at the bar as well.  The waitresses are always friendly as well.  They usually look like chickens running around with their heads cut off but they do not ever seem to forget anything.  There is also a bus boy that provides salsa, chips, and will refill your drinks.  The food is authetic which doesn't mean everything you order is spicy.  I even love their side salads with the jalapeno vinaigrette.  The vegetables are fresh and the dressing is delicious.  I also enjoy the fried ice cream as well.  they offer it with chocolate or caramel sauce.  So let's get ot he good part, the margarita's...they are delicious.  You can get a variety of flavors and tequila.  They come out in a mason jar for sharing.  Be prepared to have a driver if you are going to try several different kinds.  I love this place but give it 4 stars for the size.  The restaurant and bar are very small.  It is a great place to have good food."}
{"text":"I had to come here simply because of the name. Being from AZ and CA I know great mexican food so I wanted to laugh at what east coasters had to suffer through. Margarita was decent, kinda like the Jose Cuervo pre-made jugs. The chips were nice and crispy but the salsa was similar to Pace. I ordered the lunch taco salad with beans instead of meat. It was a cute small taco shell, a good portion for lunch. The only issue with my salad was that it had vinaigrette which did not mix well with the refried beans. The inside of this place was definitely authentic mexican too bad the food wasn't. Service was slow but it seemed like there was only 1 waiter in the whole place."}
{"text":"We have been here several times in the past with no problems, however yesterday was terrible.  Chicken burrito with no spices or real taste. Very dry.  My sons beef burrito was almost as bland.  Also we had to listen to staff complain about new servers, and make inappropriate comments in regards to females. The bathroom was filthy as well.  Our server was pleasant and attentive, but that was overshadowed by the above. My family will not return which is a real shame since they used to be the best Mexican food in the North hills."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be so good, and I've given it the benefit of the doubt that maybe I've been there on a bad night, but we've now had horrible experiences the last three times we've been there, so I'm thinking it's more than a fluke.  As a North Hills resident, I actually feel bad for having recommended this restaurant to people so many times in the past.  Two weekends ago my family was visiting from out of town, so we decided to take them here.  We used the NoWait app, got there, and the app said our table was ready.  The hostess said that because we had six people, our table wasn't quite ready yet.  No problem, I've used NoWait many places and it can't always be \"exact\" on your wait time.  Well, an hour and a half passed (we had two young boys with us, so we felt EVERY minute of it), and party after party filled in while we waited (even a party of 5).  We asked why they couldn't just put two tables together as we had been waiting so long, but they insisted that there was only one \"big\" table they could put us at, so they had to wait for those people to be finished.  No apologies or even acknowledgement (meanwhile, three other parties had experienced similar issues with the app and walked out).  When we finally sat down, it took 20 minutes to get drinks, was virtually impossible to get refills, and the food was nothing like it used to be.  I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because this place used to be a go-to of ours for Mexican in the North Hills and might still have the potential, but somewhere along the line, something's gone wrong.  If you sign up for the email club you do get a free entree on your birthday...I'd most likely go back for that, but don't see myself ever returning to pay full price again."}
{"text":"Great service. Blah food. American fare available for the kids. Nothing to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"The locals rave about this place, so we went in on a saturday around 2pm. The place wasn't crowded, only two tables with people dining. We ordered our food; black bean burger and fish tacos. After two drinks, the waitress assuring us we would get our food soon and 40 minutes later, we get our fare. Cold.  Of course we only paid for our drinks and asked the waitress to remove the untouched meals back to the kitchen."}
{"text":"So disappointed.  Cheese onion enchilda with huge chicks raw onions no sauce, rice hard and cold.  Asked for sour cream multiple times and never got it.  So disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty gross. Works if you are in a pinch but you can do better. Good chips and salsa though."}
{"text":"I've only heard good things about this place, but I didn't think it was very good. My fianc√©e lived in Mexico for 3 months and agrees with me. We go to Patr√≥n. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting The Franklin Inn, fiends always raved about the food and service. I will say I absolutely have to agree! Mary Kay was our bartender/server her service was over the top. She made great recommendations and the food was fresh and authentic. Will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Wow. What a turn around. This cute little place went from having horrible food to good food. And the chef came out to talk to diners and asked for input. I still prefer a few other Mexican establishments but the location is convenient for the North Hills crowd."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended as the spot to go in the North Hills for Mexican food. I was really excited to find a potential go-to Mexican hotspot in my backyard but was rather disappointed after the experience.  Three of us went on a Wednesday afternoon so it wasn't overly busy. The waitress sat us in a corner table despite having other more open tables available. The first thing I noticed was how cramped the floor plan was. If it had been busy, you would be bumping into people just to get in and out of your seat.  The waitress brought us waters and the complimentary chips and salsa. It was strange that the menu stated you only get one basket of chips and bowl of salsa but our waitress kept bringing more and we weren't charged so that was a plus. I've never seen a Mexican joint specifically say only one basket before. We placed our orders quickly and I ordered off of their lunch menu. I got the Taco Salad with chicken and their cilantro dressing. It took a longer than normal amount of time for our food to come out for a typical Mexican restaurant in my opinion. When the food did make it out my friends were missing their salads. They had to track down the waitress to ask about them and she admitted that she totally forgot to put them in with the order. While my Taco Salad looked amazing, the taste was awful. First of all, the cilantro dressing was great! I will say that! But the chicken on the salad was like the stringy chicken from a can that was like warm and place on top of the veggies which made them slimey. The dressing helped mask the blandness somewhat but ultimately I only ate about a third of it. The waitress came to clear the plates and asked if I wanted a box. When I declined I expected her to ask if everything was okay because it was obvious I hadn't eaten much at all. She just took my plate away and brought the bill. I'll also note that she tried to carry too much and spilled salsa on my friend's lap and didn't even notice.  Both friends seemed to like their meals well enough but said they didn't think it lived up to the hype. We also didn't get any offer for refills on our waters the entire meal. We had to ask at he end after the plates were cleared.  Like I said, I was not impressed. The service was poor and the food was just south of so-so for me.  The atmosphere while decorated very nicely was far to cramped and a little dingie. I did like the look/presentation of the food and the cilantro dressing was a plus. They do sell that by the bottle. Perhaps I was there on a bad day but the experience definitely doesn't make me want to go back. I'll force myself to try it a second time to be sure but not before trying out some other local Mexican spots first."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at this restaurant on a Saturday night on the recommendation of a friend. The staff is clearly overworked, service was glacial, and we were ignored for most of the evening. One of the margaritas was basically watered-down unflavored tequila. The chips were good and the queso was satisfactory, but the entrees were served barely warm and not particularly appetizing--one dish was unseasoned and dry, another was served in a sauce reminiscent of paste. Will not pass the recommendation on."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's more telling; the fact that I'm usually willing to return to The Franklin Inn if suggested or invited, or the fact that I'm never the one making the suggestion to return.  Overall, I feel like The Franklin Inn is a neighborhood restaurant for the surrounding neighborhood more than a destination restaurant for those living further away, say, in the city. The food is average, but probably tastes a lot better if you're local and it's the closest Mexican-inspired food nearby, and the service is spotty unless you sit at the bar. Our latest server was decent, but only after she noticed us sitting at our table for what felt like ten minutes. She then forgot the little requests, like \"no sour cream and no guac, but add lettuce.\" It wasn't the biggest error, but one which meant that the restaurant just wasted food that we didn't eat, and showed that she didn't pay close attention. It's not the first time that's happened there, but at least the servers are always quick to fix forgotten requests.  The margaritas are pretty decent, and I enjoy the touch of the mason jars they're served in, but they're a little too sweet for me. Of course, I'm typically more of an eater than a drinker, so the food usually needs to be the high point of an experience. Sadly, that's where The Franklin Inn has always left me underwhelmed. The one thing I do enjoy is their queso. It's so incredibly thick and rich that you better REALLY like cheese if you order it. Of course, that also means that it's so heavy that I feel like I should've run a marathon before ordering such an appetizer.  I've tried the wings, quesadillas, and tacos. Some of my friends really enjoy their chorizo, but I've always felt like it was incredibly dry and overcooked. The shrimp fajitas we had, while having good flavor, seemed like they were shrimp out of bag of precooked and frozen shrimp. They came out waaaaaaay overcooked. You also only get 8 little shrimp on a giant skillet of peppers and onions. Don't be surprised if you run out of shrimp by the third tortilla shell and enjoy a third tortilla of just peppers and onions.  As far as vibe, it's okay. If you're not from the area, it's easy to feel like an outsider. It seemed like many of the patrons were regulars based on the interactions between them and the hosts, bartenders, and waitstaff. That's not a bad thing, but adds to the neighborhood feel. At one point I said to my wife that it felt like the Mexican version of Breadsticks from Glee. The bar is small, but there are some nice TV's if you want to stop in and watch a game. It's a small space, but if you can get a seat, i'd always recommend the bar over the dining room.  Ultimately, I'm still willing to go back, but it'll likely always remain in the easy-to-ignore category for us since it lacks crave-worthy items."}
{"text":"The Franklin Inn is easy to describe in one word, bland.  It's basically exactly what you would expect from a \"Mexican\" restaurant located where it is.  I should have known what I was in for when most people at the bar were eating wings.  Wings at a Mexican restaurant?  Seriously?    Anyway I love Mexican food and was excited to finally go there, well I doubt I'll be going back.  First off we had a party of 9, they refused to take reservations even for a party this large which is a rarity.  Their advice to us?  \"Call us an hour before you want to come to see how busy we are\", yeah thanks.    I ordered the Chicken Enchiladas, with rice and corn and bean salad as my sides.  When I say that nothing on my plate had any taste, it's not an exaggeration.  It was cheese, chicken and a corn tortilla.  I tasted no spices, and really no effort at all.  It legitimately was just those 3 ingredients on a plate, that's what it tasted like.  The rice and the bean/corn salad followed suit by being completely bland.   There was nothing to say that these enchiladas weren't purchased from the frozen food section at a grocery store and thrown in the oven.    If you are 90 years old, and like bland, tasteless, effortless food then this is the place for you, or apparently if you like wings (which I did not try).  If you actually want good Mexican food, where they put effort into their dishes then don't bother."}
{"text":"We went for dinner and were greeted by the hostess who sat us immediately. Waitress was patient as 2 in our party had gluten allergy. Food was outstanding and we had the shrimp and chicken fajitas. Try the roasted jalape√±os they are great."}
{"text":"After hearing so many good things about this restaurant we decided to give it a try.  Unfortunately it didn't work out as expected.  We never got seated.  The line is long on Saturday which is not unusual for a popular restaurant.  What was unusual was the way their wait list was managed.  Our party was passed over a dozen times during a 2 hour period by groups of similar size.  The only difference was the groups being seated  seemed to know the greeters.  The conclusion we reached was that newcomers are not welcome.  Don't even try this place on a busy night if you aren't a regular.  It was terribly frustrating to be passed over.  No matter how good the food may be, it isn't worth it.  The disrespect we experienced tonight was unprecedented.  Just awful!"}
{"text":"Not 5 stars because it can just be slow. But the good is excellent. Truly delicious food with some locally sourced meats. The drinks are generously made - no skimping with bottom shelf alcohol, either. I have never been disappointed. I love it there. When I visit western PA I am sure to get dinner!"}
{"text":"WTF?!?!   The menu claims everything is prepared fresh, which I'm sure it is, back at the restaurant supply distributor where they order from. If that's not bulk GFS or Sam's Club Salsa, then I'm Donald Trump and you should elect me for president.   Then came the entree. I ordered a beef burrito with refried beans and rice. The rice was cold to the touch, the refried beans were the consistency of spackle with a crust of paint chips  (and also cold). The burrito shell was doughy and elastic, and the shredded beef filling inside was lukewarm to the touch, and had zero seasoning. There was also a little container of black liquidy stuff on my plate which looked like it was wrung out of a dirt mop in the deep sink of the janitor closet. There were some chunks of stuff in it, but I don't know wtf it was, and I didn't want to find out. Since I was starving, I dug out my bland shredded beef from the cold husk of dough that resembled a burrito shell and picked at that while I watched my table companions politely nibble at their equally cold and bland entrees. Someone at the table ordered a \"sangria\", which we determined must have been cranberry and apple juice with a splash of maybe Boone's Farm wine. I had a Dos Equiis Amber, which came with a little lime wedge, which was by far the most flavorful food item I received all evening.  It was crowded and loud in there, so I guess the locals must come here just to get sloshed on margaritas before heading out to Taco Bell for a superior Mexican dining experience. This must be what prison food is like. If that's the case, it should be enough of a deterrent to scare anyone straight.   Bleh."}
{"text":"I was really unsure about this place because of the name. My friends family have been coming here for years and they rave about the food.   I was excited to try The Franklin Inn after hearing all about it. My friends parents ordered a margarita and I thought about ordering one until I tasted it. It was almost inedible with the amount of tequila in it. So we asked for another one and the waitress brought back the same margarita topped off with mango syrup and no ice. It was even worse than before. I was enjoying this place until the waitress tried to be sneaky with putting some syrup in an already gross margarita.   I ordered a chicken burrito. It was mediocre at best. I enjoyed what I had ordered but there was no flavor or seasoning. It was a tortilla, chicken, some cheese inside, and pico. Then melted cheese on top and my two sides. The sides were the black bean corn salad and fajita vegetables. The sides were also average. The prices are a little high for what you're getting.   For Mexican American food it was a poor attempt. The menu and chef could use some revamping. This is a place I'd come back to for chips and salsa and I'd try some tacos. I would have given them 4 stars if the waitress had not given back the same warm drink."}
{"text":"As far as I have experienced, this is the best Mexican restaurant in the city! And, it's pretty darned yummy!!!  Though I grew up in the 'Burgh, I now live in Philly; And yes, the restaurants there are more \"authentic\".  However, \"authentic\" doesn't always mean tasty.  But, the Franklin Inn is ALWAYS tasty!!!  You may recognize it from it's famous, though small, part in movie \"Dogma\". That wonderful \"cheese\" vibe still prevails.  The service is always great and the margaritas are some of the best that Pittsburgh has to offer.  Note: If you are going on the weekend, expect a wait.  The things they do best: * Chili Rellenos - My Mom always orders this dish.  She says it's the only thing that has ever come close to her Mexican rellenos experience (and, my parents are foodies).  Stuffed with cheese and batter fried to a golden brown, these mild peppers are a treat! * San Carlos Fisherman's Dinner - Crispy, flavorful cod that you fashion into the perfect soft taco = YUM! * Chicken Enchiladas with Pablano Mole - Their mole is BY FAR the best mole I have ever had!!!  The flavor is to die for!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food! Crowded! Service was ok, but so busy it took awhile for another drink. Reasonably priced! Good menu, and awesome happy hour drink specials!! Will come back here for sure!"}
{"text":"The Franklin Inn is a family owned bar/restaurant, off the beaten path, tucked away in Franklin Park, and easily the best wings in Pittsburgh! They come grilled and fried one way, HOT!  *wing and taco special on Monday Nights.   The service in the bar is top noch (where everybody knows your name) and much faster than the dining room! .Happy Hour everyday 4-6pm. .Closed Sundays. .No reservations... use the NoWait app when you're on your way,  to get on the list for the dining room."}
{"text":"Very authentic neighborhood bar vibe.  People are engaging I what feels like meaningful conversation.  Monday night is their wing night with $2 beer specials and probably the BEST wings in Pittsburgh.. seriously.  I'm open to debate and they only come in one flavor -- awesome.  They're definitely hot but tasty as well.  Because they're so good, I can't tell you how good or not good the actual Mexican food is.  Can't get past ordering wings each of the ten plus times I've been there - go figure.    They also have a very popular happy hour from 4-6 I believe.  Get here on the early side to avoid waiting!  They use the 'no wait' app if you don't like lines but having a beer at their bar is half the fun.  This place makes the 'Rock On' official best of the best list in the city.  Enjoy, rock on!"}
{"text":"Amazing every time. Strong margaritas. Spicy crispy wings. I love the Frisco enchilada. Our go to spot in Franklin Park!!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican-style restaurant. It is a little small given the number of people waiting to be seated. Good overall."}
{"text":"This place is for the locals and that's how it's always been. I literally live down the street from the place. I'm not sure why people expect 100% authentic Mexican cuisine in western Pennsylvania. I find the tiny atmosphere and friendly staff to be the most charming aspects of the place. The food IS GOOD. (Note: good, not five star, mind blowing, best Mexican ever. I've been to Mexico several times so I know the authentic stuff) I personally love the salsa and chips. The margaritas are great too! Original on the rocks with salt is the way to go. The Franklin Inn must be doing something right if the lobby is packed Thursday until Saturday for dinner. I will never get sick of the place, but maybe that is my bias that developed from being brought here since I was a child. Once a again, great atmosphere, great drinks and great chips. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"After living in So Cal all these years and many occasions slipping to Baja California, MX; nothing compares to the Mexican food there.  Fallbrook, CA and Brawley, CA has some of the best local Mexican restaurants bar none.    Franklin Inn will do for now; the flavors come very close.  It must be the absence of guacamole in the dishes.  Guacamole is standard in most plates in the west.  We will ask for it next time.    The portions are just right for Franklin Inn.  Not like Taco's Tomas in LA's famous Farmers Market where you need a full days fasting before eating their portions.  This is the best Mexican restaurant in the Burgh so far.  Now if you really want fish tacos.  Read my review of Juniper Grill.  I would compare their fish tacos to the Ensenada MX fish market stalls any day."}
{"text":"It's totally Mexi-cheesy decor and has that \"You come here as a regular and love it or you come here as a one-time thing and hate it\" attitude.  I enjoyed  Franklin Inn much more as a child when the only other benchmark I had was Chi-Chis and much more as an adult of legal drinking age.  I guess I haven't been here in a few years to experience their margaritas, but I was craving one on Saturday and didn't feel like hauling my cookies down to McKnight Rd for a Big Azz Marg at Mad Mex.  Their margarita got the job done.  There were about 8 different flavors that you could get in 16 or 32 oz mason jars; I went with a traditional on the rocks, no salt.  It was zippy but I missed the fresh lime tang and heat from good tequila that I've come to expect at other places.  It came with a basket of chips and salsa.  Salsa was nice, but more like salsa soup: partially watery with chunks of veggies here and there.  The best part was listening to the manager(?) explain that a Troegs Nugget Nectar is dark and not too hoppy.   #rly?  One of the bartenders said to another customer, \"If I drink beer, I go for a Miller,\" so their beer selection is definitely not where they focus attention.  I didn't get anything to eat, but I have been here for lunch/dinner and can say that it's \"American Mexican,\" but nothing fantastic (unless something changed since I ate here last, which I doubt).    We got a margarita, a Dos Equis, and a Troegs and the bill came to $18.  I guess that's comparable to Mad Mex.  It's getting 3-stars because it's \"a-ok.\"  I like it because I grew up coming here and probably will come back around happy hour, but if I want a trendier place with fresh, spicy offerings, I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Amazing local spot in Franklin Park. Best wings you'll ever eat. Margaritas are served in mason jars and are delicious! Happy hour is a MUST here. They have really great enchiladas, taco salads, tacos, and more. Really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Love this place. The best chips and salsa and margaritas. Not a chain which is great. Unique. Always crowded because it's such a great place. Happy hour is good if you can make it since it's early."}
{"text":"This is our ALL time favorite place to go during the week . The blackened wings & salsa and chips with a freshly made margarita is simply the best ! The owners and servers treat you like family and it's honestly our favorite place !"}
{"text":"Best margueritas  in town. Excellent Mexican food in an area of Pittsburgh you might not expect to find it. Servers do a good job."}
{"text":"This is cheap Mexican food you buy in the frozen food section. Don't waste your time. You can learn how to make better stuff on your own at home."}
{"text":"Isn't there 1/2 a star for a place like this? Was this Mexican? I thought it was airplane food meets 4-year-old-trying-to-cook... this takes the cake for really bad Mexican (no flavor, dry as heck refried beans) and moderate prices -- too high for what it was. Want delicious Mexican? Try Texas or California!  But, anyway, back to the Franklin Inn... the tortilla chips were surprisingly tasty (crunchy) and good, as was the service -- very friendly, and the atmosphere: super cozy and cute.   Thank God they have a full bar, (the Mojito was okay - tasted of cheap vodka). But, hey, with food like this, you need something strong to wash it all down."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here since I was young. The food has been consistently good, and when I order my old favorites, they taste exactly how I want them to.  Now, this is Mexican restaurant falls into what I like to call the 'Clean Mexican' category, the opposite being 'Sloppy Mexican'. You know what I mean, it's the difference between your food being separated on the plate and not too saucy -vs- saucy beany cheesy delicious mess on your plate.  It is worth the trip to the North Hills, even if you prefer the sloppy stuff. They also have amazing margaritas and sangria."}
{"text":"Ok. Not worth going out of your way for, but generally decent. Rather noisy and can be a wait for seating.   Mol√© enchiladas were very good and the portion generous. So-so on being allergy friendly. Fairly priced."}
{"text":"So my daughter and I went to dinner tonight and I ordered the Frisco Enchiladas like I have always done in the past bc they are my favorite. My dinner arrives with red enchilada sauce ALL over the enchiladas and under them too! Mind you these have NEVER come with any hint of red sauce on them! NEVER! So I ask the waitress what's up and she says she wondered why there was red sauce all over them! Then the acting manager Chris comes over and asks what's wrong. I tell him that these do not come covered and bathed in the red sauce. He says to me, \"Do you want me to remake them?\" Seriously? Yes please. Make them like they are suppose to be like. Insert eye roll here. He takes the plate and after 20 minutes return with them. They are COVERED in red sauce and are still sitting in a pool of it as well! That was it! I have been coming here for years and have always defended this restaurant when people said bad and unkind things about it but now I understand why people do that! Sorry but no more for me. You have lost a great customer bc of your inability to produce food like it was suppose to be made."}
{"text":"Since I did theater in Wexford in the early 80's, I'd heard talk of 'Franklin Inn', and 'Mexican Food', but had never gone until this week. I had always wondered where 'Franklin' and 'Mexican'  made some connection.  But being out and about in the North Hills, brought up the idea of checking it out (finally).  So we found the address and checked it into the GPS.  As we set off on the trek, and our roving Gypsy GPS voice lead us all over suburbia and darned near into rural reaches, we really started to wonder HOW a Mexican restaurant ended up ended up in the middle of suburban nowhere Western PA.  We found the location, and discovered a little kitschy painted stand alone building, surrounded mostly by a residential area, with a large gravel parking lot.   So one of the first things I had to do was ask the waitress HOW a Mexican restaurant ended up in the middle of nowhere suburbia. And I learned my history of the Franklin Inn.   Starting in 1979, the Franklin Inn was basically a roadhouse style bar and restaurant, with no particular theme. And then they started having theme 'nights', including a Mexican food night, which became their most popular night of the week. Now, we're not talking about the sophisticated 'city' crowd looking for some serious ethnic escape and cuisine.  We are talking about far off rural and suburbanites who were hankering for some tacos and margaritas, and they found them suddenly in ONE place within their safe driving zone.  Eventually, the Mexican theme night outdid anything else the place was known for, so they shifted their main focus to just that.  Now, taking all of that into consideration, and noting not having seen a single Latino on the premises, I completely comprehend why this is NOT great Mexican food, but rather 'just good enough' for a Western PA suburbanite crowd. Pretty much if you made it at home, this is probably what you'd be eating.  The portions and prices were all reasonable and fair. I had a combination sampler, for $13, and my friend had a quesadilla that was in the $8 or $9 vicinity. The quesadilla was two large tortillas sandwiching cheese and chicken and was more than enough for him. My combo was selected from a choice of like six items. They have a two combo and a three combo, and I chose the three. I had a ground beef burrito, a chicken enchilada, and a chile relleno, and the combos all came with two 'sides', so I opted for rice and beans.  The rice and beans were totally basic. Not exceptional, just basic. The best of the combo trio was the ground beef burrito which had the most seasoning and flavor, and the most disappointing was the chile relleno, which was not the poblano pepper that it's supposed to be, but some other pepper, very possibly a small cubanella - fortunately NOT a bell pepper, which would have really ticked me off.  Before the entrees, we had a basket of chips, which were not bad, accompanied by some salsa which again was very basic.  The chips were light and crispy, and seemed pretty fresh, but the salsa was only about one step up from a basic jarred salsa.  I also ordered the chile con queso dip, with added chorizo, but requested it without onions, which may have made them stray from their ordinary path. The cheese was tasty, but VERY thick, almost gluey. Chips broke off in it almost every time. I'm not a big fan of the soupy cheese dip variety, but this was an extreme in the other direction. The chorizo was fine, but it was just sprinkled over the top of the cheese in the bowl. I wouldn't say this was any fine variety of chorizo. Just some basic slightly more spiced sausage.  The service was great, the prices were decent - the entire bill came to just over $30, including the iced tea (they're Pepsi people) and my friend's Tecate.  Everyone was friendly and accommodating, so it wasn't a less than pleasant trip.  But when it comes to being 'authentic' Mexican food, don't count on it. It is an extremely basic American version of Tex-Mex that appeals to a far reaching suburban crowd that really has no concept of 'better'. This really is like going to Joe and Barbara's house for a night of Mexican food that they assembled from a shopping trip to Costco. You'll have a nice time at Joe and Barbara's, but later, when you want to have some REAL Mexican food, hit up Patron Grille or El Campesino. If you feel like goin' inta da big city, try Mexico City or Las Velas for something that tastes more authentic, where actual Latinos are staffing the kitchen."}
{"text":"Julie, our server, told us what to order and we listened.  The Chorizo and Bean Dip starters set the pace.  Julie will get you to the finish line. Trust in Julie."}
{"text":"I used to really love this place for a long time but as of recently I had two bad experiences and have not returned since.  But before I get into that I do want to say the margaritas are out of this world!   Bad experience number one was dramatically dry beans when I went with my sister and we didn't think too much of it because typically we had a great time. The salsa portion with our chips was very small too.   Number two I ordered the mole and it was sickeningly sweet, even for my sister who has a sweet tooth. I had her try it to make sure I wasn't insane. Anyways i didn't eat more than one bite and the bite my sister took. Waiter comes back he was a bit sketchy seeming definitely a new hire and asked why I haven't eaten that much. I told him it was too sweet for me and I have had mole in the past it was never that sweet. He said mole is always sweet and did not even ask if I wanted to order something else. It wasn't until he asked if I wanted a box that I asked to speak to the manager because obviously I didn't want a box for food I wasn't going to eat! He said he would get him and forty five minutes had passed still nothing. He claimed he was in an interview and told him about the situation and said he would deal with it after. At this point my sister and I were annoyed and ready to leave so we decided we would wait fifteen more minutes so this would be an hour of waiting just for that. He never came out and the waiter said he couldn't do anything about the situation for me. So I paid for a meal that I did not even eat or enjoy and never went back. I used to love this place though."}
{"text":"Pretty much the furthest thing you can get from Mexican food. Also, it is clear that meals are either purchased frozen or made and then frozen, because mine was frozen in the center. The staff was not at all alarmed or apologetic when I informed them, I'm pretty certain they took it, popped it in the microwave, and then brought it back to the table. Those are the main reasons not to go here.  Besides that, staff was rude, not at all friendly. You know there are no actual Mexicans involved when Spanish is misspelled everywhere, even on the bathroom door! \"se√±ors\" does not mean anything in Spanish, what the hell is that?!  It just all goes to show that there is 0 effort put forth anywhere in this establishment. Save your money and your time.   If you are looking for a good Mexican restaurant  in the Pittsburgh area, Emiliano's is pretty good and pretty authentic. They of course \"Americanize\" some dishes and add some things to the menu, but they have authentic dishes and actual Mexicans."}
{"text":"This is clearly Americanized Mexican food. I love fish tacos and the closest The Franklin Inn comes is the Fisherman's Dinner with cornmeal crusted cod, tortillas, and a side. No lime. No cabbage. No condiments. Nothing spectacular.   The enchiladas are bland as well. The chicken tastes like it was just boiled in water and the sauce was very tomato-y. I make better enchiladas at home with doctored-up canned sauce.   There is way better Mexican in the North Hills - Patron - now that's real Mexican food!"}
{"text":"You'd never know our little neighborhood restaurant that doesn't outwardly look like a Mexican restaurant was hidden gem.  The interior is nice and warm, the beers & margaritas cold, and the staff friendly.  I've been coming here for years and never had a bad meal.  The poblano peppers mole is outstanding, and the nachos & fajitas never disappoint.  There's always more than enough food per portion, so your money is well spent.  Do yourself a favor and try it out.  I bet you come back."}
{"text":"Comin' from a California girl, this was some pretty good Mexican food. My favorite was the queso (it's cheddary!). It was very mild but you can ask for them to spice it up.. (didn't realize that until after, so I'll be sure to try that next).  The make your own quesadilla I ordered with chile peeped and pico was perfectly grilled and melted.  Hubby got Colorado green chile enchiladas which also were fantastic.   Service was quick and friendly (we came in for lunch on a rainy Saturday so they were pretty empty) We'll be back again for sure. to try their famous margaritas!"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about the Franklin Inn for years so I was really excited when my friends and I went there to eat on Saturday 9/6. Sadly the whole experience was disappointing. The food was bland,things that should have been cooked well undercooked and then things that didn't need to be cooked as much were overcooked. Service was so-so and we were no there at a busy time so I can only imagine how it would be when the place is packed.  I don't know what people rave about - I got the southwestern salad with jalapeno vinaigrette dressing and shrimp - my shrimp was hard and overcooked (or possibly freezer-burnt?) and the dressing was bland while the cheese on the salad tasted/looked like it was Kraft Mexican Cheese blend - I would have expected some authentic Mexican cotija cheese at the least.  We also ordered the guacamole which we all love and it was just \"ok\" - bland and nothing special - we actually didn't even finish the small portion between the three of us which is unheard of!  My friends got the wahoo fish tacos and the chorizo quesadilla.  The fish on the tacos was dry and flavorless while the chorizo quesadilla lacked that special kick that chorizo sausage usually has. I would recommend any number of mexican restaurants in the Pittsburgh area over The Franklin Inn such as Casa Reyna, Las Palmas, Cafe Verde or even El Campesino, Patron's and Emilianos would be much better choices."}
{"text":"Yes I'm going to up it to four stars from Franklin Inn.  Stopped in the day after I got into town as DH & I had a hankering for their famous wings.  Ordered 12, and wow they tasted even better than we remembered.  I have to say the consistency of their wings is mind boggling.  I've been eating at this fine establishment since the late 80's, and I've always ordered the wings.  I'm happy to report they are still as good as they always been.  I did not get a chance to order their margaritas this time, but saw they were still pouring free hand on the heavy side.  I'm sure they are just as strong as they have always been.  Now as far as the rest of their food goes I have to say it's so so, but honestly their wings and margaritas are worth the trip here!  You won't be sorry.  So glad this place is still going strong in my old neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I'd rather eat here than pay $50 for a bunch of ground meat and white american cheese melted on a plate over a bed of ice berg lettuce ie: ( like at El Crap-isino or Emilianos ) I feel like I get raped after having a margarita and my food comes out looking like it was already eaten and regurgitated  up on to my plate. I rather go up to Qdoba and feast on  a belly bomber Burrito. Want some beans ? Let me up-chuck some pre-digested  mash and call it re-fried beans."}
{"text":"We go to the Franklin Inn fairly regularly and it is always good food and great service. Tonight though they had a grilled tuna special that was phenomenal.  Please put it on the regular menu."}
