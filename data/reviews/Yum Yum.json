{"text":"I LOVED the food here. It's a smaller restaurant (very cosy) and very casual. They actually only serve Vietnamese up to 8:00 pm, then on Chinese food after that time, which I find very odd. But who cares. I would come back again because the food was really fresh tasting. We ate realy Chinese food, not the Western Chinese cuisine so this food was really good and didn't taste heavy."}
{"text":"This place is REALLY close to the office so I frequent here alot in a week, so far everything I've had here is great! Portions are big, their satay beef is SO tasty, and the prices are a good deal. Have even tried a couple chinese items off their menu and was not disappointed. Each day I come I have noticed that they've been getting busier and busier, especially on Tuesdays (25% off the entire menu). IMO they are doing great for just opening, deff my favourite new lunch/dinner place!!!"}
{"text":"The two guys that work here, are cool as hell, although the people that own this place aren't Vietnamese they do make a mean Chinese incorporated stylized dish, food is great, service is awesome, environment is clean and quiet, and on Tuesday's it's an extra 20% off. This is one of my weekly spots to eat at, highly recommended"}
{"text":"Came here because on Tuesdays their entire menu is 25% off (every other day is 15%).  I wasn't sure what to expect because the staff are not Vietnamese, but the food ended up being more than decent.  I had the pho dac biet and the broth was actually quite flavorful with a ton of meat.  Huge portions, decent pricing and friendly service - what's not to like? During their grand opening period each diner gets a free spring roll as well!   3.5 stars."}
{"text":"It opens 6 month for business now, family business. Ambient is good, modern & clean, foods are just typical, sate beef noodle soup are just adding the sate paste to Pho soup, its not the real way. Service is great for my 4 star.... Ok place for quick foods."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for lunch since it first opened.  The restaurant decor is a lot better than the previous restaurant in the same spot.  It is amazing how new furniture can transform the place.    The lunch waiting staff were great.  If you need something, just ask.  I am also surprised at how busy they are already during lunch time given how new the restaurant is.  They must have done a good job of advertising.  The portions were good.  The large noodle soup was enough to fill me right up.  Their fried quail was tasty and a bit different than the fried quail at other Vietnamese restaurants.   I got takeout from here on the way back home from the office one night and ordered a large noodle soup.  Surprisingly, the portion was quite small given my experience with them while dining in at lunch.  I don't know if it was a mistake or if their take out portions are just significantly smaller.  Overall, it is a place that I will most likely go back to regularly to dine in."}
{"text":"Portions are HUGE, and very reasonably priced.  Had the satay beef with extra satay on the side.  The broth was pretty decent and there was tons of meat!  I prefer  my satay noodle soup more on the creamy side, but this still delivered good flavour.  Next time, I'll get the regular.  The large was way too big for me to finish."}
{"text":"The broth flavour is amazing. I can't get enough of it and order the large just to get more broth. The prices are great. They give a free spring roll to each patron. And they give a discount in the evening.   If you like dumplings I seriously suggest the deep fried dumplings. So delicious."}
{"text":"This is my father-in-law's favourite Vietnamese restaurant.  I finally checked it out and realized why he loves it so much - the value is off the charts.  The food is cheaper than anywhere else I've seen in Calgary and the portions are massive.  They even served us complimentary spring rolls.  The problem?  The food isn't that great... I found it quite salty.  However, if it's value you're looking for, you've come to the right place."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant for Vietnamese dishes, my family are regulars here.  It's our go-to place now for Pho.  If you're craving a heart warming delicious bowl of pho, the house special is an amazing deal - get the extra large as it comes with A LOT of meat, in a very tasty broth.  Fantastic prices (I actually think they undercharge to build a clientele) and really friendly staff.  We've also tried several other dishes like the pork chop rice (which came with a very nicely marinated pork chop), a variety of the vermicelli \"bun\" dishes and some of the appetizers (chicken wings and deep fried quail).  Every time that I've gone, they also give each guest a complimentary spring roll.  Everything that we've had is very good and we return often."}
{"text":"Decided to try Yum Yum after spotting the ad of this restaurant in the Chinese weekly paper.  The restaurant is quite small, with multiple booths along the windows, 1 round table for 6, 2 very large round tables for big family-style dinners, and a couple of smaller tables in the corner.  They have their own parking lot.  I understand that it gets really busy on weekends and dinners so the wait staff told me to reserve for tables for 5 & above.  Tried their Chinese lunch menu and they have the usual Chinese noodle dishes, congee as well as Vietnamese fare.  Prices are reasonable.  We ordered the following: - Fish Congee - quite good, congee is on the thick side with lots of fresh fish slices - Home Style Vermicelli - good sized platter of vermicelli with baby shrimp, sliced Chinese sausage, bean sprouts & scrambled egg - Salt & Pepper Cappelini - this was so good!  Enjoyed by all. - Chinese Broccoli with oyster sauce - asked them to make the Chinese Broccoli a little more tender so it is easier to chew.  All in all, we enjoyed the food here and am planning to come try their Chinese dinner in the evenings."}
{"text":"I give this new establishment 3 and 3/4 stars.... but it doesn't show above... here is why: dine in..pho...I still like noodle world better 2.) Ambiance it's 5 star. 3.) Service ... not as good 4.) Price....very reasonable Take out.... Portion awesome  Price awesome Need to check this out....they have high percentage discount on certain day. Check in with the restaurant. They serve Chinese food too it seems from the looks of their take out menu under chefs recommendation."}
