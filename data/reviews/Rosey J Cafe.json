{"text":"This cute little cafe by Yonge and Finch has a very instagramable feel to it. It's bright interior, industrial light fixtures and modern seating comes together to create a very unique cafe. I came here to study and grab a bite and was treated very well. The server was accommodating and warm and helped me in picking a dish I would like. I got the beef bone soup and a pork belly dish. They also serve Ahmad tea here which really spoke to my middle eastern roots, it's rare and hard to find Ahmad tea at a restaurant or cafe that is not middle eastern. I reccomend this spot to anyone looking for a calm place to study or a quiet place to catch up and chat !!"}
{"text":"This place was empty on a Sunday night but decided to check it out because of the high ratings from the reviewers below. 

Let me start off by saying the interior is super cute. I love the design and it's definitely \"instagram friendly.\" 

However.... the service was awful. Anytime I asked a question they would answer in such a condescending way. For instance, I asked them \"what's your most popular milk tea?\" And they said \"there's only one.... the rosey j milk tea,\" even though there were more listed on the menu. They also looked visibly annoyed when I asked them for a napkin. Okay then.

The milk tea itself was okay. It was really sweet, but decent. I haven't tried the food so can't comment on that.

I probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"I went in to look around and left pretty quickly because the servers are super weird.

It was around 1pm and I walked in with a friend to check out their menu.

The whole cafe was empty.

The server/owner was sitting in the corner table.

When we walked in, they just sat there staring at us.

I had to ask them, \"are you guys open?\"

Then the server stood up and said \"yea.\" And just stared at us and did not offer us a menu or anything.

It was super uncomfortable so I left."}
{"text":"Love the food and service! The pork Jowl is one of the best dishes!!! I will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"I went there because the inside looked really cute. I got the strawberry shortcake and it was frozen....also got a milk tea that tasted like instant milk tea bought from T&T. I could see the powder still unmixed at the bottom. It was so bad and overpriced. Worst cafe I've been to in my life."}
{"text":"Hidden beside the Coco's at Yonge and Finch, I've found cafe heaven. Rosey J serves Ahmed Chai... so rare to find this outside of a middle eastern home or a shisha spot. They also have a really unique colour scheme for a cafe (I'l, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is such a great place for studying and hanging out with my friends. The foods here are great especially the pork belly and the stuffed chicken wings."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this place. Exceptional food and beverages, and excellent services."}
